A yellow-pigmented, Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped bacterium, strain KIS3-4T, was isolated
from soil collected on Daechung Island in the West Sea of Korea. Phylogenetic analysis based on
the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed strain KIS3-4T in a distinct lineage in the family
Xanthomonadaceae. Strain KIS3-4T shared 87.3–93.7 % sequence similarity with members of
the family Xanthomonadaceae, and was related most closely to the genera Dyella and
Dokdonella. In its biochemical characteristics, strain KIS3-4T was clearly separable from other
genera within the family Xanthomonadaceae on the basis of the hydrolysis of cellulose and urea,
high G+C content (64 mol%) and fatty acid profile. Major fatty acids (.10 % of the total fatty
acids) were iso-C17 : 1v9c (32.8 %), iso-C17 : 0 (18.0 %) and iso-C16 : 0 (12.7 %). Q-8 was the
predominant respiratory quinone. Phosphatidylethanolamine and several unidentified
aminophospholipids and phospholipids were present. Based on its unique phenotypic, genotypic
and phylogenetic features, strain KIS3-4T represents a novel genus and species, for which the
name Rudaea cellulosilytica gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain of Rudaea
cellulosilytica is KIS3-4T (5KACC 12734T 5JCM 15422T).

The family Xanthomonadaceae consists of Gram-negative,
rod-shaped bacteria. Its members are characterized by
positive catalase activity, negative nitrate reduction (with
the exception of Stenotrophomonas) and variable oxidase
activity. Chemotaxonomically, they have complex fatty
acid profiles that include branched-chain and/or hydroxyl
fatty acids, and contain ubiquinone Q-8 as the predominant isoprenoid quinone. According to Saddler &
Bradbury (2005), the members of the family Xanthomonadaceae were Xanthomonas, Frateuria, Fulvimonas, Luteimonas, Lysobacter, Nevskia, Pseudoxanthomonas, Rhodanobacter, Schineria, Stenotrophomonas, Thermomonas and
Xylella. Since then, the genera Aquimonas (Saha et al.,
2005), Aspromonas (Jin et al., 2007), Dokdonella (Yoon
et al., 2006), Dyella (Xie & Yokota, 2005), Luteibacter

The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene
sequence of strain KIS3-4T is EU741687.
Images of cells of strain KIS3-4T and fatty acid composition by 2-D TLC
and a table of fatty acid comparisons are available as supplementary
material with the online version of this paper.

(Johansen et al., 2005) and Silanimonas (Lee et al., 2005)
have been added to the family.
A soil sample was collected from Daechung Island in the
West Sea, Republic of Korea. Soil (1 g) was suspended in
9 ml of 0.85 % NaCl (w/v) and serially diluted solutions
were plated on R2A agar (Reasoner & Geldreich, 1985). A
strain, designated KIS3-4T, was isolated after incubation at
30 uC for 4 days.
Phenotypic characteristics, including Gram-staining, catalase and oxidase activity and hydrolysis of CM-cellulose,
casein, chitin, DNA, hypoxanthine, tyrosine, Tween 80,
starch and xanthine, were determined using the methods of
Smibert & Krieg (1994). The pH range (pH 4–10 at
intervals of 1 pH unit) for growth was determined on R2A
agar that was buffered with citrate/phosphate buffer or
Tris/HCl (Breznak & Costilow, 1994). Growth with 1, 2, 3
and 5 % NaCl (w/v), and at various temperatures (5–50 uC
at intervals of 5 uC) was investigated in R2A broth. Tests
with the API 20NE, API 20E, API ID 32GN and API ZYM
systems (bioMérieux) were generally performed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The API ZYM test strip

was read after 4 h incubation at 30 uC, whilst the other API
strips were examined after 7 days at 30 uC. Cell morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy
(912AB; LEO) and phase-contrast microscopy (Axio
Imager.A1; Zeiss) by using cells grown on R2A agar.
Polar lipids were analysed according to Minnikin et al.
(1984). Fatty acid methyl esters were extracted and
prepared by using the standard protocol of the Microbial
Identification System (MIDI) after cells were grown on
R2A agar for 2 days at 30 uC. Isoprenoid quinones were
analysed by HPLC as described by Groth et al. (1996). The
DNA G+C content was determined by HPLC analysis of
deoxyribonucleosides as described by Mesbah et al. (1989)
using a reversed-phase column (Supelcosil LC-18-S;
Supelco).
The 16S rRNA gene sequence was determined by PCR
amplification (Kwon et al., 2003) and direct sequencing
(Hiraishi, 1992). A partial 16S rRNA gene sequence (1384

nt) was determined for strain KIS3-4T. CLUSTAL W version
1.8 (Thompson et al., 1994) was used to align the sequence
of strain KIS3-4T with corresponding sequences from
related taxa retrieved from public databases. Phylogenetic
analysis was performed using MEGA version 3.1 (Kumar
et al., 2004) with the neighbour-joining and maximumparsimony methods. Bootstrap values were calculated from
1000 replications.
Strain KIS3-4T grew on R2A agar but not on nutrient agar,
trypticase soy agar or MacConkey agar (all from Difco).
Cells of strain KIS3-4T were aerobic, Gram-negative, motile
with peritrichous flagella, rod-shaped (0.5 mm wide and
1.0–3.0 mm long) (see Supplementary Fig. S1, available in
IJSEM Online). The phenotypic characteristics that differentiate strain KIS3-4T from related genera are listed in
Table 1.
Polar lipids of strain KIS3-4T included phosphatidylethanolamine and several unidentified aminophospholipids

(APLs) and phospholipids (PLs) (Supplementary Fig. S2a).
Despite the similarities of the major components, strain
KIS3-4T could be distinguished from Dokdonella koreensis
DSM 17203T (Supplementary Fig. S2b) by the presence of
APL1, PL1 and PL2, and the absence of APL2, PL4 and an
unidentified polar lipid. The predominant fatty acids
(.10 % of total fatty acids) of strain KIS3-4T were isoC17 : 1v9c (32.8 %), iso-C17 : 0 (18.0 %) and iso-C16 : 0
(12.7 %) (Supplementary Table S1). The major quinone
in strain KIS3-4T was ubiquinone 8 (Q-8), which is also
found in all the members of the family Xanthomonadaceae.
The G+C content of the DNA was 64 mol%.
It is evident from the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) that strain
KIS3-4T belongs to a distinct lineage in the family
Xanthomonadaceae. The strain formed a monophyletic
clade with the genera Aquimonas, Dokdonella, Dyella,
Frateuria, Fulvimonas, Luteibacter and Rhodanobacter with
95 % bootstrap support, which was confirmed by the
maximum-parsimony tree. Strain KIS3-4T revealed highest
sequence similarities, with the exception of uncultured
environmental clones (Costello & Schmidt, 2006; Lozada
et al., 2006), with Dyella species (93.1–93.7 %).
Strain KIS3-4T can be differentiated from closely related
genera by the presence of arginine dihydrolase, the
hydrolysis of cellulose and urea, the polar lipid pattern
and the major fatty acid composition (Table 1,
Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Moreover, the similarity level (,94 %) of the 16S rRNA

gene sequence of strain KIS3-4T with closely related genera
within the family Xanthomonadaceae is much lower than
95 %, a value that has been proposed as a ‘practicable
border zone for genus definition’ (Ludwig et al., 1998).
On the basis of these results, it is proposed that strain
KIS3-4T represents a novel species in a new genus, Rudaea
cellulosilytica gen. nov., sp. nov.
Description of Rudaea gen. nov.
Rudaea (Ru.da.e9a. N.L. fem. n. Rudaea an arbitrary name
after RDA, Rural Development Administration, where
taxonomic studies of this taxon were conducted).
Cells are Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, motile rods.
Catalase- and oxidase-positive. Nitrate is not reduced.
Glucose is not fermented. H2S is not produced. Arginine
dihydrolase is produced. The major isoprenoid quinone is
ubiquinone-8. The major fatty acids (.10 %) are isoC17 : 1v9c, iso-C17 : 0 and iso-C16 : 0. The DNA G+C content
of the type strain of the type species is 64 mol% (HPLC).
Phylogenetically, the genus belongs to the family
Xanthomonadaceae. The type species is Rudaea cellulosilytica.
Description of Rudaea cellulosilytica sp. nov.
Rudaea cellulosilytica (cel.lu.lo.si.ly9ti.ca. N.L. n. cellulosum

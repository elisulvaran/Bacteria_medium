ABSTRACT: The expanding use of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) raises

17

environmental concerns. Wastewater treatment systems are potential recipients of SWCNTs

18

containing influent, yet the impacts of SWCNTs on these systems are poorly documented. In this

19

study, the microbial responses to SWCNTs in simulated phenol wastewater treatment systems

20

were investigated. The phenol removal rates were improved in all SWCNTs-treated sequencing

21

batch reactors during the first 20 days, but when facing higher phenol concentration (1000 mg/L)

22

after 60 days, reactors with the highest concentration (3.5 g/L) of SWCNTs exhibited a notably

23

decreased phenol removal capacity. Cell viability tests, scanning electron microscopy analysis

24

and DNA leakage data suggested that SWCNTs protected microbes from inactivation possibly by

25

producing more bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which could create a protective

26

barrier for the microbes. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed that the

27

bacterial diversity did not change significantly except for a minor reduction after the immediate

28

addition of SWCNTs. Bacterial community structure significantly shifted after SWCNTs

29

addition and did not recover afterwards. Zoogloea increased significantly upon SWCNTs

30

shocking. At final stage, Rudaea and Mobilicoccus increased, while Burkholderia,

31

Singulisphaera, Labrys and Mucilaginibacter decreased notably. The shifts of these dominant

32

genera may be associated with altered sludge settling, aromatic degradation and EPS production.

33

This study suggested that SWCNTs exerted protective rather than cytotoxic effects on sludge

34

microbes of phenol wastewater treatment systems and they affected the bacterial community

35

structure and diversity at test concentrations. These findings provide new insights into our

36

understanding of the potential effects of SWCNTs on wastewater treatment processes.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are amongst the most promising engineering nanomaterials due to

40

their unique physiochemical properties compared to bulk materials. They have been incorporated

41

into a diverse array of commercial products such as pharmaceuticals, optical devices, cosmetics,

42

electronics and antimicrobial coatings.1,2 With the exponential increase in manufacturing and

43

application of CNTs in nanotechnology, they will inevitably enter various environmental

44

matrices.3-6 However, the potential environmental risks are poorly understood and a

45

comprehensive investigation is needed.

INTRODUCTION

46

Cytotoxicity of CNTs to microbes has been demonstrated using pure microbial strains.7-13

47

The underlying molecular mechanisms were proposed to be the synergistic impacts of cell

48

membrane perturbation and oxidative stress. However, evidence has shown that CNT toxicity to

49

pure microbial strains is a poor predictor of toxicity to microbial communities.14,15 A number of

50

studies have therefore investigated the effects of CNTs on microbial communities in aquatic and

51

soil environments.16-18 For instance, Chung et al. reported that high concentrations of CNTs

52

significantly lowered biomass and some enzyme activities of microbial communities from an

53

urban soil,19,20 while Shrestha et al. suggested that soil respiration and extracellular enzyme

54

activities were not significantly affected in a sandy loam soil even in the presence of extremely

55

high concentrations of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).21 CNTs were also reported to

56

affect microbial degradation of aromatic pollutants including 2,4-dichlorophenol and

57

phenanthrene.22,23 Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the responses of microbial

58

communities to CNTs from various environments.

59

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as important receptors and the sink of waste

60

streams, are amongst the most probable CNT recipients of industrial and domestic effluents.24

61

Moreover, CNTs are being tailored to work as catalyst supports, composite filters, adsorbents

62

and antimicrobial agents in wastewater treatment processes, increasing the likelihood of contact

63

with microbial communities in activated sludges.2,25 Consequently, they may pose a risk to the

64

microbial populations and their associated functions. In this respect, the effects of other

65

nanoparticles (Cu-, Zn-, Ag-, Al2O3-, ZnO-, TiO2-, SiO2- nanoparticles), especially Ag-

66

nanoparticles, have been extensively studied and most negatively affected waste removal

67

efficacy.26-28 Only a few studies have examined the effects of CNTs on wastewater microbial

68

communities.29-32 Luongo and Zhang found that MWCNTs inhibited the activated sludge

69

respiration in a dose-dependent manner within three hours,30 and that single-walled carbon

70

nanotubes (SWCNTs) altered the structure of the bacterial communities in the sludge systems

71

within five hours based on automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA).29 Very

72

recently, two studies also revealed that CNTs affected bacterial community structure of activated

73

sludge and its corresponding functions including methane production, nitrogen and phosphorus

74

removal.33,34 Notwithstanding, the ecological effects of CNTs on activated sludge system and

75

microbial survival are far from clear.

76

Recently, reports have demonstrated that CNTs altered the composition and structure of

77

microbial communities based on results from several culture-independent technologies including

78

ARISA, PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), multiplex-terminal restriction

79

fragment length polymorphism (M-TRFLP) and clone library analyses.18,29,35 However, these

80

methods only allowed identification of microbial populations at rather coarse taxonomic levels.

81

Current advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques have not only increased sequencing

82

depth at a lower cost, but also provided higher taxonomic resolution.36-38 Especially, the Illumina

83

MiSeq platform, which is able to achieve comparable or greater sequencing depth than related

5
ACS Paragon Plus Environment

Environmental Science & Technology

Page 6 of 32

84

pyrosequencing, has been widely used to examine the phylogenetic/taxonomic diversity,

85

composition and structure of microbial communities from a variety of environments.21,39

86

In this study, we aimed to: (1) explore the impacts of SWCNTs on pollutant removal

87

efficiency in activated sludge systems, (2) investigate the microbial survival and cytotoxic

88

mechanism, (3) monitor diversity and structure shifts of microbial communities, and (4) identify

89

the dominant microorganisms susceptible to SWCNTs. To achieve these goals, sequencing batch

90

reactors (SBRs) were constructed for treating phenol containing wastewater which were dosed

91

with 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 g/L SWCNTs. Results demonstrated that SWCNTs played protective

92

roles for sludge microbes, and in the meantime changed the structure of sludge bacterial

93

communities.

96

SWCNTs and Activated Sludge. Commercially available SWCNTs (>95%) were purchased

97

from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China) and were suspended in distilled water

98

using ultrasonic treatment for 30 min to obtain a better dispersion. More details regarding the

99

SWCNTs have been described previously.40 Activated sludge was gathered from the secondary

100

sedimentation tank of Chunliu River WWTP (Dalian, China).

101

Experimental Design. The reactors were 65 cm tall with an internal diameter of 8 cm and a

102

working volume of 2.5 L. Fine air bubbles for aeration were supplied through an air pump at the

103

reactor bottom with an airflow rate of 0.4 L/min. The synthetic wastewater consisted of 20 mg

104

KH2PO4/L, 90 mg NH4Cl/L, 10 mg NaCl/L, 12.5 mg MgSO4·7H2O/L, 12 mg CaCl2/L, 10 mg

105

FeSO4·7H2O/L, 785 mg glucose/L and 200 mg phenol/L. The SBRs (n=15) were seeded with

106

activated sludge (2.57 g/L, dry weight at 105 oC), and domesticated with the synthetic

107

wastewater. The SBRs were operated under identical conditions. Each cycle of SBR was

108

operated for 24 h, including 2 h fill, 18 h aeration, 2 h settling, and 2 h decant. Effluent was

109

discharged with a volumetric exchange ratio of 50%. After 15 days of domestication, the SBRs

110

were divided into 5 groups, each receiving different concentrations of SWCNT (g/L): 0 (G1), 0.5

111

(G2), 1.5 (G3), 2.5 (G4) and 3.5 (G5). Each group contained three replicates. During the two

112

month operation period, phenol concentrations of the influent and effluent were monitored daily,

113

and the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS), the sludge volume after 0.5 h of

114

settling (SV30), pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured every other day. Since the system

115

was operated in good condition, and there was barely any sludge discharge during the whole

116

process, the MLSS was relatively stable during the process (Figure S1), thus the sludge retention

117

time was not considered herein. The influent phenol concentration was increased to 1000 mg/L

118

on Day 61 to compare the robustness of the control reactors with the SWCNTs-treated ones.

119

Phenol removal was monitored on Day 1, 20, 40, 60, 61 and 67 (the last day of operation).

120

Analytical Methods. Since activated sludge used in this study was gathered from a municipal

121

WWTPs and aerated immediately which was transparent and colorless after centrifugation, the

122

concentration of phenol was measured directly using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (V-560,

123

JASCO, Japan). MLSS and SV30 were determined according to standard methods. The pH and

124

DO were measured using a pH meter (S20, Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland) and a DO meter

125

(FLX310, Flow Electronic, China), respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of

126

the SWCNTs and activated sludges were recorded using a Field Emission Scanning Electron

127

Microscope (KYKY-1000B, KYKY Technology, China). For the detection of live/dead cells, the

128

2-(4-amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride (DAPI, Beyotime, China) and

129

propidium iodide (PI, Beyotime, China) staining assays were performed according to the

130

manufacturer’s instructions. The efflux DNA was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy

131

(Hitachi, Japan) using DAPI as the fluorescent dye (excitation 364, emission 454 nm) after

132

filtration through a 0.22 µm membrane. The bound extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) of

133

activated sludge was extracted using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Concentrations of protein

134

and carbohydrate were measured using the Lowry and anthrone methods, respectively.41

135

DNA Extraction, PCR Amplification and Sequencing. Activated sludge samples were

136

collected at Day 1, 20, 40, 60 and 67 before sludge settling, and the genomic DNA was extracted

137

using a protocol based on Purkhold et al.42,43 DNA concentration was measured with Pico Green

138

assays using a FLUOstar OPTIMA fluorescence plate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany). For

139

high-throughput sequencing, the primers 515F (5’-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3’) and

140

806R (5’-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3’) were used to amplify the V4 region of the 16S

141

rRNA gene.44 PCR was conducted in a 25 µL mixture containing 0.1 µL AccuPrime High

142

Fidelity Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen, USA), 2.5 µL of 10×AccuPrime PCR buffer II, 1 µL of

143

each primer (10 µM), 1 µL template DNA and 19.4 µL nuclease-free water under the following

144

conditions: 94 °C for 1 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 53 °C for 25 s, and 68 °C for 45 s; and a

145

final extension at 68 °C for 10 min. Each sample was amplified in triplicate. PCR products were

146

pooled, purified through QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and quantified by Pico Green

147

analysis. The 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing was conducted on Illumina MiSeq platform

148

at the Institute for Environmental Genomics, University of Oklahoma.

149

Sequencing data analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. After sequencing, PhiX sequences

150

were removed and primers were trimmed (mismatch 1.5), and the paired-end reads were joined

151

using the Flash program (phredOffset 33, standard deviation of fragment lengths 20).45

152

Sequences containing ambiguous reads (N) and reads shorter than 240 bp were removed.46 The

153

resulting sequences were screened for Chimeras using UCHIME.47 Operational taxonomic units

154

(OTUs) were categorized using CD-HIT at a 97% sequence similarity threshold,48 and the

155

taxonomic assignment of OTUs was performed by RDP classifier with 50% confidence.49 The

156

above processes were performed through a pipeline (http://zhoulab5.rccc.ou.edu/) (not

157

published). Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and correlation tests were calculated

158

using R v2.15.1 (http://www.r-project.org/). Three nonparametric tests, including multiple

159

response permutation procedure (MRPP), permutational multivariate analysis of variance

160

(Adonis), and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) were performed to test dissimilarity among

 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

164

Characterization of SWCNTs. Cytotoxicity of CNTs was closely related to the

165

physicochemical properties. The pristine SWCNTs used here were 5-16 µm in length, and less

166

than 2 nm in diameter, with a surface area of 500-700 m2/g. SEM and TEM micrographs were

167

obtained to confirm the manufacturer’s description.40 The impact of low metal impurities (carbon

168

content > 95%) was not considered since it showed insignificant antibacterial activity on soil and

169

activated sludge communities.15,29,35 With the increasing manufacturing and application of CNTs,

170

more and more CNTs will inevitably enter WWTPs via CNT production facility’s release,

171

manufacturing and disposal of CNT containing products.4,5,50,51 CNTs released from composites

172

such as sports equipment, tires, electronics, etc. have been reported elsewhere.51 CNTs may

173

agglomerate and accumulate in activated sludge due to their high hydrophobic and

174

biodegradation-resistant characteristics.5,34 In previous reports, low concentrations of CNTs have

175

been proven to exert no or little impact on microbial and enzyme activities of soils and activated

176

sludge.19,33,35 Our preliminary experiments also showed that the microbial communities were not

177

changed with 0.1 g/L SWCNT, while a noticeable shift was observed in 2.0 g/L SWCNT group

178

using PCR-DGGE analysis (data not shown). Therefore, the concentrations of SWCNTs used in

179

the present study were set at a relative high level from 0.5 to 3.5 g/L.

180

Effects of SWCNTs on Reactor Performances. Acute and chronic influences of SWCNTs on

181

the phenol wastewater treatments were mimicked over a course of two months’ operation.

182

Phenol was almost completely removed after one cycle of operation in all reactors (Figure 1). On

183

the first 20 days, phenol removal rates were SWCNT-dose-dependent with the order of

184

G5>G4>G3>G2>G1 (Figure S2). On Day 1, the removal rate reached 96.1 ± 2.4% within two

10
ACS Paragon Plus Environment

Page 11 of 32

Environmental Science & Technology

185

hours in G5, while it took eight hours for G1 to reach a similar removal rate, indicating a positive

186

influence of SWCNTs on phenol removal in this system. After a 40-day operation, all groups

187

reached similar phenol removal rates (Figure S2). Therefore, despite the potential toxicity,

188

SWCNTs appeared to exhibit positive effects on sludge microbial communities, especially

189

during the early stages of operation. SWCNTs have been widely used as adsorbents for heavy

190

metals and aromatics removal by virtue of their unique properties.52-54 Results from this study

191

also indicated a dose-dependent relationship between phenol removal and SWCNTs, and 3.5 g/L

192

SWCNTs could adsorb 58.9% phenol (initial concentration 180 mg/L) within 6 hours (Table S1).

193

Thus, we initially speculated the elevated phenol removal rates on Day 1 and 20 were attributed

194

to phenol adsorption by SWCNTs. However, when using autoclaved sludge systems, phenol

195

adsorption did not improve in SWCNTs-treated groups (Table S1). It was previously proven that

196

carbon-based nanomaterials could adsorb free EPS and improve EPS production, which could

197

form a protective barrier for the microbes.12,31,34 Therefore, we determined the bound protein and

198

polysaccharide concentrations of the five groups (Figure S3), which revealed higher bound EPS

199

concentrations in SWCNTs-treated SBRs compared to the control group. Altogether, our results

200

suggested that the potential protective mechanism of SWCNTs possibly resulted from the higher

201

bound EPS production.

Figure 1. Phenol removal performances of each group during the 67-day operation process. Each

204

group was performed in triplicate with different concentrations of SWCNTs (g/L): 0 (G1), 0.5

205

(G2), 1.5 (G3), 2.5 (G4) and 3.5 (G5).

206

The phenol concentration in the influent was increased to 1000 mg/L on Day 61 to

207

investigate the robustness of the constructed systems. Over 94% of the phenol was removed

208

within 14 hours in all groups with slightly lower removal rate in G5 (Figure S2). On Day 67, all

209

five groups showed different removal performances. G1 had a similar removal rate compared to

210

Day 61; G2, G3 and G4 showed higher removal rates, in which 96% phenol was removed within

211

10 hours; G5 had a considerably lower removal rate, requiring over 18 hours to achieve 88%

212

phenol removal (Figure S2). Therefore, different concentrations of SWCNTs had different

213

effects on wastewater treatment systems. At low concentrations, they improved treatment

214

performance. Once past a threshold, i.e. 3.5 g/L in the present study, they could result in a

215

negative impact after a longtime interaction.

216

To determine cell survival rates upon addition of SWCNTs, cell viability tests (DAPI/PI

217

staining) was performed at each sampling time (Figure2, Figure S4). The percentage of

12
ACS Paragon Plus Environment

Page 13 of 32

Environmental Science & Technology

218

inactivated cells in the control group was similar to G2 and was much higher than those in G3,

219

G4 and G5. This phenomenon was consistent throughout the whole operation. Therefore, the

220

addition of SWCNTs at relatively high concentrations apparently lowered phenol toxicity to cells.

221

DNA leakage data also revealed a higher cell-free DNA intensity in G1, confirming the lower

222

cell membrane damage rates in the SWCNT groups (Figure S5). The results further confirmed

223

the positive influences of SWCNTs on the vitality of the microbial communities, which were

224

also consistent with the EPS data. Three major cytotoxic mechanisms of CNTs have been

225

recognized in previous studies, i.e. generation of oxidative stress, release of certain impurities

226

and physical perturbation.33,34,55 The reduced cell death and high purity of SWCNTs in the

227

present study implied oxidative stress and metal purities should not be significant. SEM images

228

showed a prevalence of aggregates of SWCNTs, largely reducing their direct contact with

229

microbial cells (Figure S6). Only a few morphologically changed cells intertwined with

230

SWCNTs, indicating limited physical toxicity of SWCNTs.15,29 Meanwhile, the bound EPS

231

concentrations in SWCNTs-treated groups were higher than those of the control group, further

232

reducing the possibility of SWCNT physical toxicity. Therefore, the cytotoxicity of SWCNTs on

233

sludge microbial communities was very limited and negligible. However, our results also

234

suggested that G5 displayed a decreased phenol removal capability after phenol shock on Day 61,

235

contrary to the results derived from microscopic observations. The distinct phenol degrading

236

capability could be primarily, if not completely, due to community shifts resulting from

237

SWCNTs addition.

242

Shifts of Bacterial Community Diversity and Structure. The sludge samples from Day 1, 20,

243

40, 60 and 67 were sequenced using the Illumina Miseq platform. After removing low quality

244

sequences and chimeras, the sequence number of each sample was rarefied to 15131, resulting in

245

226-579 OTUs at the clustering threshold of 0.97. Our results showed that 99.9% of the

246

sequences belonged to bacteria. SWCNTs addition significantly reduced Shannon diversity and

247

evenness (ANOVA P=0.027 and 0.025, respectively) on the first day (Table 1), while the

248

richness (OTU and Chao1) did not change (P>0.05). Thereafter, the Shannon indices, OTU

249

richness and evenness were similar among all groups (P>0.05), suggesting a shock loading

250

effect upon SWCNTs addition, followed by a gradual recovery of bacterial diversity. Our results

251

were in accordance with the report by Khodakovskaya et al. that CNTs did not affect soil

252

bacterial diversity after a nine-week influence,39 while Hai et al. reported that continuous
14

Page 15 of 32

253

addition of 20 mg/L MWCNTs significantly decreased bacterial diversity,33 indicating the

254

influence of CNTs on microbial diversity was inconclusive.

Pearson correlations between taxa abundances and CNT concentrations were assessed to

258

estimate the impact of SWCNTs on taxonomic groups (Table S2). On Day 1, more taxa were

259

positively affected than negative ones at phylum, class, genus and OTU levels, whereas the

260

opposite trend was observed at all other sampling time. For example, the majority of

261

significantly impacted OTUs (78/106) were of lower abundances on Day 1, yet much smaller

262

fractions of those were reduced on other sampling days (32/155, 27/93, 31/98, 55/126 for day 20,

263

40, 60 and 67, respectively). Therefore, the short-term exposure to SWCNTs repressed the

264

growth of the majority of bacterial populations, while continuous interaction exhibited positive

265

effects.

266

DCA analysis showed that the G1 samples at all sampling time separated from the other

267

groups on a two-axes plot (Figure 3). Hierarchical clustering analysis also showed that the

15

Environmental Science & Technology

268

triplicate samples of G1 clustered together and separated from the samples of all other groups

269

(Figure S7). Dissimilarity analyses by Adonis, ANOSIM and MRPP confirmed that G1 was

270

significantly distinct from the other samples (data not shown, P<0.01) at all time points. The

271

changes in bacterial communities, especially the dominant populations, may lead to disturbed

272

system functions.

277

among different groups at each sampling time (Day 1, 20, 40, 60 and 67). Symbols represent the

278

samples from different groups. A distinct cluster can be defined from the samples of G1 based on

279

the DCA ordination, which suggests the differences in microbial community structures between

280

G1 and other four groups.

281

Susceptible Genera in Response to SWCNTs. The influences of SWCNTs on dominant genera

282

(relative abundances over 1%) were further assessed at the initial (Day 1) and final (Day 60)

283

stages of SWCNTs addition. On Day 1, there were 11 dominant genera in all groups, among

284

which only Zoogloea exhibited different abundances among groups (ANOVA, P<0.05) and it

285

did not survive at final stage (Figure S8). The SV30 values in our experiment were in the order of

286

G1 (72.8% in average)>G2 (62.4%)>G3≈G4≈G5 (50.3%) in the first 10 days, which indicated

287

that the addition of SWCNTs improved sludge settling ability (Figure S9). Yin et al. also

288

reported SWCNTs addition improved sludge settling ability by 5.7-10.8% within five hours.31

289

Species of Zoogloea (Zoogloea ramigera) were widely spread in activated sludge, and have been

290

regarded as the key populations responsible for the flocculation of activated sludges.37,56,57

291

Therefore, the increased Zoogloea upon SWCNTs addition in this study might have positively

292

influenced the sludge settling ability.

293

There were 19 dominant genera on Day 60 (Figure S10), and 7 of them showed significant

294

shifts (Figure 4). Rudaea, the most predominant population at final stage, remarkably increased

295

from 3.17% in G1 to 10.90-26.55% in G2-G5 (Figure 4). The relative abundance of this genus on

296

Day 67 (3.69% in G1, 11.47-26.48% in others) was similar to that of Day 60 (Figure S11).

297

Rudaea has been identified in long-term contaminated soils with biphenyl, benzoate and

298

naphthalene, as well as in a petroleum refinery wastewater treatment plant, thus it is of

17
ACS Paragon Plus Environment

Environmental Science & Technology

Page 18 of 32

299

considerable potential for aromatics biodegradation.58,59 Meanwhile, it is also known for

300

cellulose degradation and was detected as the predominate and sensitive genus susceptible to

301

metal nanoparticles, especially nano-TiO2.60,61 In our study, the increase of Rudaea in SWCNTs-

302

treated groups might lead to improved aromatic (such as phenol) degradation capacity.

303

The abundances of Burkholderia, Singulisphaera, Mucilaginibacter and Labrys in

304

SWCNTs-treated groups were notably lower than that in G1. Members of Burkholderia were

305

known to play important roles in bioremediation of recalcitrant xenobiotics, as well as

306

polyphosphate uptake and accumulation in activated sludge systems.62-64 Type strains of Labrys

307

were reported to be capable of degrading fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene and various

308

pharmaceuticals.65,66 Thus, the changes of these two bacteria might cause the fluctuation of

309

xenobiotic removal performance. Singulisphaera was a newly established genus belonging to the

310

order

311

Mucilaginibacter including Mucilaginibacter gracilis and Mucilaginibacter paludis were also

312

proficient in degrading various biopolymers (pectin, xylan, laminarin, etc.).68 Therefore, the

313

higher abundances of Singulisphaera and Mucilaginibacter in G1 might result in relatively more

314

EPS degradation, which may explain the higher EPS concentration in SWCNTs-treated groups.

315

Mobilicoccus was another increased genus in response to SWCNTs. It has so far only been

316

isolated from fish intestinal tracts and its ecological role in WWTPs kept unknown.69 Geothrix

317

was an anaerobic Fe(III)-reducing bacterium which usually existed in hydrocarbon-contaminated

318

matrix.70 The roles of this genus also needed further investigation.

Figure 4. Relative abundances of significantly shifted genera in SWCNTs-treated groups

321

compared with control group on Day 60. ANOVA analysis was adopted and the 7 genera had

322

P<0.05.

323

Rhodanobacter was another predominant genus with relative abundance of over 10%.

324

Although it showed no significant differences among G1 to G4 (ANOVA, P>0.05), it was

325

significantly lower in G5 (7.54%) compared with G1 (16.73%) at final stage (Figure S11).

326

Rhodanobacter was reported to be capable of aromatics degradation and denitrification.71,72 The

327

decrease in abundance of this genus might negatively affect aromatic degradation and nitrogen

328

removal performance in G5.

329

Most of the previous studies only searched the shifted microbes upon SWCNTs addition at

330

one time point, yet the long-time and termly detection of community changes could bring us

331

more useful insights. Our results revealed similar responses of Rudaea, Burkholderia, Geothrix,

332

Mobilicoccus and Labrys at any sampling time, indicating that they were more susceptible to

19
ACS Paragon Plus Environment

Environmental Science & Technology

Page 20 of 32

333

SWCNTs in phenol wastewater treatment systems (Figure S11). However, SWCNTs exhibited

334

varied or converse effects on some other taxa including Rhodanobacter, Singulisphaer and

335

Mucilaginibacter at different time points. It suggested the impacts of SWCNTs were of temporal

336

relations. Under in situ conditions, more complicated surroundings will induce disparate impacts

337

on the community members. Therefore, the ecological effects of SWCNTs should be

338

investigated case by case.

339

It was previously reported that high concentrations of SWCNTs could significantly reduce

340

urban soil enzyme activity and affect 2,4-dichlorophenol mineralization, possibly by inhibiting

341

the activity of soil endogenous microorganisms, whereas low concentrations of SWCNTs

342

showed no or little influence on the microbes.19,22 Based on our study, 3.5 g/L seemed to be the

343

threshold for SWCNT toxicity, above which the performance of the SBRs could be unstable

344

upon high phenol influent shock. For controllable engineered system-bioreactors, the

345

performance and stability correlated with functional redundancy.73-75 Hence, the specific

346

contributions and interactions of the community members, and particularly the impacts of

347

SWCNTs on related functional genes need further investigation to obtain an in-depth

348

understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the SWCNT ecological effects. Since SWCNTs

349

can significantly alter the microbial community structure, both improving and inhibiting

350

wastewater treatment system performance, application of CNTs to wastewater treatment systems

351

should be carefully considered for balancing both positive and negative effects.

352

Implications. Although SWCNTs were shown to be toxic to bacteria elsewhere, this study

353

showed that addition of SWCNTs to phenol wastewater treatment systems could reduce

354

cytotoxicity and increase phenol removal rates. However, the performance of bioreactors

355

receiving a 3.5 g/L dose of SWCNT was significantly lowered upon loading with high

20
ACS Paragon Plus Environment

Page 21 of 32

Environmental Science & Technology

356

concentrations of phenol, suggesting SWCNTs also posed a potential threat to the treatment

357

systems. SWCNTs addition significantly altered the composition and structure of indigenous

358

activated sludge microbial communities. Zoogloea, Rudaea, Mobilicoccus, Burkholderia,

359

Singulisphaera, Labrys and Mucilaginibacter were significantly shifted which might result in

360

microbial community function fluctuations. The high-throughput sequencing technology has

361

proven to be a feasible method for detecting subtle microbial changes resulting from CNT

362

contamination in realistic environmental matrixes, which will contribute to promoting

363

understanding of SWCNT nanoecotoxicology.

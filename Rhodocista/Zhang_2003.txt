A novel bacterial species, Rhodocista pekingensis sp. nov., was isolated from a municipal
wastewater treatment plant and characterized by polyphasic taxonomy. Cells of R. pekingensis
were Gram-negative, motile by a single polar flagellum, vibrioid to spiral, 0?6–0?8 mm in width and
0?8–1?5 mm in length. R-bodies were not observed. Phototrophically grown cells contained
lamellar photosynthetic membranes and bacteriochlorophyll a. Cell growth was anaerobically
phototrophic or aerobically chemoheterotrophic. Anaerobically grown cultures were pink-reddish.
Thiamin and vitamin B12, but not biotin, were required for growth and 0?05 % yeast extract
stimulated growth. Acetate, lactate, pyruvate and succinate supported growth. Cysts were formed
when butyrate was used as the sole carbon source. Molecular hydrogen (H2), but not sulfide or
thiosulfate, was used as an electron donor. The major cellular quinone was Q-9. The DNA
G+C content of cells was 68?8 mol%. The type strain of Rhodocista pekingensis is 3-pT
(=AS 1.2194T=JCM 11669T).

INTRODUCTION
Many phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria show two
modes of growth: either anaerobic phototrophy under light
conditions or aerobic chemotrophy in the dark (Imhoff
& Trüper, 1989). This facultative nature of phototrophic
purple non-sulfur bacteria has led to their widespread
distribution in rivers, lakes, oceans and soil. Phototrophic
bacteria play important roles in the bioconversion of
organic matters and the biocycling of elements such as
carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in these environments. Phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria are also commonly
isolated from wastewater treatment plants (Hiraishi &
Ueda, 1994 and references cited therein). Because of their
diverse metabolisms, they have been exploited in various
wastewater treatment systems.
Spiral-shaped phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria
were included in the genus Rhodospirillum (Trüper &
Imhoff, 1989) before the proposal of the species Rhodocista
centenaria (Kawasaki et al., 1992) and Rhodospira trueperi
(Pfennig et al., 1997). As more phototrophic bacterial
strains were isolated and more information on the phenotypes and genotypes (particularly 16S rDNA sequences)
of these and other previously described strains became

available, it was evident that the original description of
the genus Rhodospirillum needed to be revised (Kawasaki
et al., 1993). The establishment of the genus Rhodocista
was based mainly on the results of 16S rDNA sequences
and also on its unique cyst-producing morphology and
cellular quinone (Q-9). Until now, R. centenaria has been
the only species of the genus Rhodocista and the type
strain, ATCC 43720T, was isolated from hot springs in
Wyoming, USA (Favinger et al., 1989). In this paper, we
describe an isolate from the Beijing municipal wastewater
treatment plant, P. R. China. The isolate was characterized
as a mesophilic, phototrophic bacterium that produces
cysts and possesses Q-9 as the major quinone. Phylogenetic
and phenotypic characterization of this isolate indicated
that it is a novel species of the genus Rhodocista, for which
the name Rhodocista pekingensis is proposed.

METHODS
Bacterial strains, media and cultivation. Strain 3-pT was iso-

lated from the Gao-Bei-Dian municipal wastewater treatment plant
in Beijing, which is the main facility for the treatment of sewage
from Beijing (a city with more than 10 million inhabitants).
Rhodocista centenaria (also named Rhodospirillum centenum) ATCC
43720T was kindly provided by Professor Carl Bauer, Indiana
University, USA.
Media used in this study were modified from the AT medium described
by Imhoff & Trüper (1992). ATB medium was made with butyrate
as the sole carbon source. ATY medium was prepared by addition of
0?05 % yeast extract and removal of sodium hydrogen carbonate from

AT medium. ATYP medium was created by addition of 0?03 % peptone to ATY medium. Agar plates were prepared by addition of 1?5 %
agar to the medium. Soft agar was made by reducing the amount of
agar to 0?7 %.
Routine cultivation was done anaerobically in screw-capped tubes or
bottles filled with medium. Incubation was conducted at 34–41 uC
under incandescent illumination of 1000–2000 lx.
Isolation. Samples of activated sludge were obtained from the

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Morphology and ultrastructures
Strain 3-pT had Gram-negative, vibrioid or spiral cells. The
cells were 0?6–0?8 mm in width and 0?8–1?5 mm in length
(Fig. 1). The cells were motile by means of a single, polar
flagellum (Fig. 1, top). Electron microscopy revealed that

municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Beijing, China.
Samples were diluted and inoculated into soft-agar tubes, which
were then incubated anaerobically in the light. After 1 week cultivation, the pink-reddish colonies were picked and streaked onto agar
plates. The plates were placed in anaerobic jars, which were filled
with argon and incubated under illumination. This was repeated
three to five times to ensure purity of the culture.
Microscopy. Morphology and ultrastructure of cells grown under
illumination were observed by optical microscopy (BH-2; Olympus)
and by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (S-570 and
H-600, respectively; Hitachi).
Absorption spectrum. Cells grown under illumination were

harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 60 % sucrose solution. This suspension was used for determination of the absorption
spectrum of intact cells. The absorption spectrum was recorded with
spectrophotometers HP1050 (Hewlett Packard) for 300–820 nm,
and Hitachi model 557 for 800–1200 nm.
Physiological characterization. Tests for photoassimilation of

organic substrates were performed in screw-capped tubes that contained ATY medium, as described by Imhoff & Trüper (1989).
DNA base composition and DNA–DNA hybridization. Genomic

DNA was extracted and purified according to the method of Marmur
(1961), except for the addition of proteinase K in the SDS-treatment
step. DNA base composition was determined by thermal denaturation
(Marmur & Doty, 1962). DNA–DNA hybridization was carried out as
described by Tindall et al. (1984) with a minor modification: DNA
fragments were labelled with a-32P, according to the instructions provided with the Nick Translation kit (Boehringer Mannheim).
Phylogenetic analysis. A fragment of 16S rDNA was amplified

and sequenced by using the MicroSeq 16S rDNA Gene kit and an
ABI Prism 377 DNA Sequencer (both from Applied Biosystems) and
primers 27f (59-GAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-39) and 1541r
(59-AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC-39). Sequence alignment and analysis of 16S rRNA gene similarity were performed with the CLUSTAL W
program (Thompson et al., 1994) and the SEQBOOT, DNADIST,
NEIGHBOR and CONSENSE programs of the PHYLIP package, version
3.5c (Felsenstein, 1993).
Quinone determination. Quinones were determined as described

by Collins (1985) and Wu et al. (1989). The bacterial pellet was
lyophilized and treated with chloroform/methanol (2 : 1, v/v). The
quinones were separated on a 254 GF silica plate (Tsingdao Marine
Chemical Corporation, China) with n-hexane/ethyl ether (34 : 6, v/v)
as the developing solvent. The number of isoprene units and the
relative percentage of components of quinones were determined by
HPLC (HP1074; Hewlett Packard), using a Bondapak C18 column
(3?96300 mm; Waters). Rhodocista centenaria ATCC 43720T and
quinone 10 (Q-10; commercial standard sample) were used as controls.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The 16S rRNA gene

sequences used for construction of the phylogenetic tree were from
the Ribosomal Database Project (Maidak et al., 2001). The GenBank
accession number for the 16S rDNA sequence of strain 3-pT is
AF523824.

phototrophically grown cells formed intracytoplasmic
membranes of the lamellar type, which were parallel to
the cytoplasmic membrane. Cysts were produced under
aerobic incubation in the dark, when grown with butyrate as
the sole carbon source (Fig. 1, bottom). Unlike Rhodocista
centenaria, no R-body was observed in cells of strain 3-pT.
Photopigments and quinones
Colonies formed under either aerobic dark or anaerobic
light conditions were pink. Liquid cultures were also pink
when grown anaerobically under illumination. When
incubated under aerobic dark conditions, however, liquid
cultures were colourless. Absorbance maxima of phototrophically grown cells were 378, 516, 548, 594, 798 and
885 nm, which is indicative of the presence of bacteriochlorophyll a and pigments of the spirilloxanthin series.
Examination of lipid extracts of lyophilized cells revealed
that the predominant quinone was Q-9, with minor amount
of Q-10. No menaquinone was detected.
Growth, physiological and biochemical
characteristics
Strain 3-pT was facultatively anaerobic and heterotrophic.
When cultivated anaerobically in the light, strain 3-pT grew
at 25–44 uC, with an optimum between 31 and 42 uC; this
strain differs from Rhodocista centenaria in that the latter
has an optimal growth temperature of 39–45 uC. The pH
range for growth was 6?5–8?0, with an optimum of 7?0. No
growth was observed in medium with 3 % NaCl. Thiamin
and vitamin B12 were required for growth. Yeast extract
stimulated growth significantly. Pyruvate, lactate, acetate,
glutamate, aspartate and succinate supported growth.
Malate, citrate, tartrate, arginine, ethanol, glycerol, mannitol, gluconate, benzoate, formate, glucose and sucrose
did not support growth. Molecular hydrogen (H2), but not
sulfide or thiosulfate, was used as an electron donor.
Ammonium salts and glutamate were used as nitrogen
sources. Sulfate was used as a sulfur source for growth.

are vibrioid to spiral in shape, positive for cyst production, have
Q-9 as the major quinone, require cobalamin (vitamin B12) for
growth, grow on acetate, lactate, pyruvate and butyrate, and do
not grow on malate or tartrate.

available from the RDP (n=15), including 11 of purple
non-sulfur bacteria and four of closely related nonphototrophs of the a-subclass of the Proteobacteria.
Among the phototrophic bacteria, strain 3-pT was most
closely related to Rhodocista centenaria (97 % similarity).
A phylogenetic tree was constructed on the basis of a
corrected evolutionary distances matrix (Fig. 2). Strain
3-pT formed a close cluster with the only species of the
genus Rhodocista (Rhodocista centenaria) and two species
of the genus Azospirillum (Azospirillum irakense and
Azospirillum amazonense).

The phenotypic differences between strain 3-pT and
Rhodocista centenaria are listed in Table 1. Briefly, strain
3-pT assimilated succinate, needed thiamin for growth,
had an optimal growth temperature between 31 and 42 uC
and no R-bodies were seen in cells, whereas Rhodocista
centenaria did not assimilate succinate, needed biotin
rather than thiamin for growth, had an optimal growth
temperature of 39–45 uC and R-bodies did occur in cells.
DNA G+C content, DNA–DNA hybridization and
phylogenetic relationships
The G+C content of the genomic DNA for strain 3-pT
was 68?8 mol%. Strain 3-pT showed 56 % DNA–DNA
hybridization to Rhodocista centenaria, which is lower than
70 %, a level generally accepted to distinguish species. A
1373 bp fragment of the 16S rDNA of strain 3-pT was
amplified and sequenced. This sequence was compared
with a dataset that consisted of 16S rRNA gene sequences

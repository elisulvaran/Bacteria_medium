(Received March 13, 1992)

To elucidate the taxonomic position of "Rhodospirillum centenum" IAM
14193T (= ATCC 43720T) (T = type strain), a cyst-forming anoxygenic
phototrophic bacterium, the small rRNA sequences (about 1,300 bases)
were determined for the organism, two cyst-forming isolates (MT-SP-2
and MT-SP-3), Rhodopseudomonas palustris ATCC 17001T and Erythrobacter longus JCM 6170T by using the reverse transcription-dideoxy
sequencing method. "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193T and the
two isolates had high phylogenetic affinity (98.8% homology). The
sequences of the two isolates were identical. Comparative analysis of the
presently determined sequences and the reference sequences (1,107 bases)
revealed that the three cyst-forming organisms belonged to the a group of
the class Proteobacteria, and were distantly related to Rhodospirillum
rubrum (the type species, a-1 subgroup) (89.9% homology) and the
representative members of other subgroups (a-2, -3 and -4) (87.6-89.8%
homology). They constituted a new phylogenetic branch in the a group.
"Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193T possessed Q-9 as the major
quinone but no rhodoquinones or menaquinones, that was a quinone
system distinct from that of other anoxygenic phototrophs. The phylogenetic evidence and the phenotypic characteristics indicated that "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193T did not belong to the genus Rhodo* Address

was isolated from a water sample (temperature, ca. 55°C) of the source pool at
Thermopolis Hot Springs, Wyoming, U.S.A. (4). The bacterium is unusual among
anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria in possessing cytoplasmic `R-body' and forming
desiccation- and heat-resistant cysts when grown under aerobic conditions in the
dark (4). Favinger et al. (4) reported the bacterium to be a member of the genus
Rhodospirillum on the bases of vegetative cell morphology and biochemical properties. However, the cyst-formation is a unique character and implies the possibility
that the bacterium is not a member of the genus Rhodospirillum. In 1987, one of
the authors (Y. H.) and T. Satoh isolated two anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria
from waste water of paste-producing plant in Japan that formed cyst-cells microscopically similar to those of "Rhodospirillum centenum."
With the purpose to establish the taxonomic position of "Rhodospirillum
centenum" TAM 14193r, we determined the l6S rRNA primary structures of the
organism and the two cyst-forming isolates, and compared these structures with
those of Rhodospirillum rubrum (the type species), the other representative members of Rhodospirillaceae and non-phototrophic members of the Proteobacteria a
group. In this paper the evidences are presented that "Rhodospirillum centenum" is
phylogenetically and phenotypically distinct from Rhodospirillum rubrum and
other Proteobacteria and the name Rhodocista centenaria gen, nov., sp. nov. is
proposed for the organism.
MATERIALS

AND

METHODS

Bacterial strains and cultivation. The strains which we examined for l6S
rRNA sequencing were "Rhodospirillum centenum" TAM 14193T (= ATCC
437201), two isolated strains, MT-SP-2 and MT-SP-3, Rhodopseudomonas palustris
ATCC 17001'and Erythrobacter longus JCM 6170T.
"Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193Tand the two isolates were grown on
SA medium (8,9) that contained (per liter) 1.0 g of sodium acetate, 1.0 g of sodium
succinate, 0.5 g of KH2P04, 0.6 g of K2HP04, 1.0 g of (NH4)2504, 0.2 g of Mg504

5 mg of Na2SeO3per liter. "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14913Twas grown at
40°C. The two isolates and Rhodopseudomonas palustris ATCC 17001Twere grown
at 30°C. For the determination of 16S rRNA sequences these were cultivated using
screw-capped test tubes (160 mm long, 15 mm wide) half-filled with culture broth.
For the determination of the quinone system and the guanine-plus-cytosine (G+C)
content of DNA, "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193T and the two isolates
were cultivated in 300 ml broth in 500 ml conical flask with cotton plug. Cultures
were illuminated with tungsten lamps. Erythrobacter longus JCM 6170T was grown
aerobically in Marine broth 2216 (I)ifco) at 30°C. For the maintenance, cultures
were grown on agar medium of the above composition under the illumination and
kept at 10°C in the dark. For cyst formation, cultures were grown aerobically on
the agar medium containing 0.3% yeast extract (Difco) and 0.2% Casamino Acids
(Difco), pH 6.8, in the dark.
Preparation and analysis of 16S rRNA. Total cellular ribosomal RNAs were
extracted by the modified method of Marmur (16), Woese et al. (28), and Yamada
and Kawasaki (31). The cells (ca. 0.1 g, wet weight) harvested and washed once
with TMK buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.6, containing 10mM magnesium acetate
and 25 mM KCl) were suspended in 500 it of TMK buffer and lysed on 0.04%
(w/v) chicken egg white lysozyme at 37°C for 10 min. The suspension was added
with 50,1 of 10°% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate and 100 icl of macaloid suspension
(15) and shaken. The mixture was added with 200~cl of phenol solution (14) and
200,u1 of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24: 1, v/v), vigorously shaken for 2 min on
a Vortex and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 min. This deproteinization procedure
was repeated again. The nucleic acids were precipitated by adding 150 ul of 10 M
ammonium acetate and 700,u1 of isopropyl alcohol. The precipitates by centrifugation were rinsed twice with 700,1 of 70% ethanol, dried and dissolved in 400,u1 of
TMK buffer. The DNA was decomposed by incubation with 1 L.dof DNase I (6080 U/Ll, Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) at 30°C for 15 min. The enzyme
was removed by treating with 200 Liiof phenol solution and 200,1 of chloroformisoamyl alcohol (24: 1, v/v) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1min. The rRNAs
in the supernatant were precipitated with 100pl of ammonium acetate and 500 p1 of
isopropyl alcohol and rinsed twice with 70% ethanol. The precipitates were dried
and dissolved in ca. 25 p1 of 10mM Tris-HC1 (pH 8.5). One p1 of this suspension
was confirmed for the purity of 16S rRNA by the 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.
Nucleotide sequences were determined by the method of Lane et al. (13), using
reverse transcriptase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.). The olygonucleotide primers used
in this experiment were 1400R 5'-CGGTGTGTACAAGGCCC-3'
(positions 1,401
to 1,385 on Escherichia coli numbering system (1,2)), 1240R 5'-CATTGTAGCACGTGTGTA-3' (1,241 to 1,224), 1110R 5'-AGGGTTGCGCTCGTTG-3'
(1,115
to 1,100), 920R 5'-CCGTCAATTCATTTGAGTTTC-3'
(926 to 907), 800R 5'CTACCAGGGTATCTAATC-3'
(803 to 786), 700R 5'-TCTACGCATTTCACCGCTAC-3' (704 to 688), 520R 5'-GTATTACCGCGGCTGCTG-3'
(536 to

Data analysis. The sequences were aligned, and the homology values and the
phylogenetic distances (KnU~
values (12)) were determined. An unrooted phylogenetic tree was reconstructed by applying the algorithm of the neighbor-joining
method (22) to Knu~values. The statistical significance of some group positions in
the tree was reexamined using the bootstrap method of Felsenstein (5) with 100
replicates.
Quinone system. Quinone system was determined according to the procedures of Ohara et al. (19) and Nakase and Suzuki (18). Quinone fractions were
extracted with chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v) from the lyophilized cells. The
fractions were separated with preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) developed with petroleum benzine-diethyl ether (9: 1, v/v) into two fractions, the
ubiquinone fraction and the fraction which showed the Rf value corresponding to
rhodoquinones. For the latter fraction, TLC was carried out again with benzene as
a developer. The both fractions were then subjected to chromatography with a high
performance liquid chromatograph (Millipore Corp., Waters Chromatography
Division, Milford, Mass., U.S.A.) equipped with a Crest-Pak C 18S column (4.6 by
150mm) (Japan Spectrophotometric Co., Ltd., Hachioji, Japan). Quinones were
detected with the spectrophotometer Lambda-Max Model 481 LC (Millipore
Corp., Waters Chromatography Division) at 275 nm. Methanol-isopropanol (2: 1,
v/v) was used as an eluent.
The G+C content of DIVA. DNA was extracted and purified by using the
method of Saito and Miura (21). Phenol-chloroform mixture (1:1, v/v) was used
at the later steps of deproteinization. The G + C content of the DNA was estimated
by using the thermal denaturation method (17, 32). DNA from Escherichia coli
IAM 1264 (strain K-12) (G+C content, 51.6mol% (26)) was used as the reference.

RESULTS

AND

DISCUSSION

The 16S rRNA sequences of "Rhodospirillum centenum" IAM 14193T, two
phototrophic isolates, MT-SP-2 and MT-SP-3, Rhodopseudomonas palustris ATCC
17001T and Erythrobacter longus JCM 6170T were determined. The nucleotide
sequences have been deposited at the DDBJ (Mishima, Japan) sequences data base
under accession numbers D12699-D12703. These sequences were comprised of
about 1,300 bases ranging between the positions 2 and 1,380 (E. coli numbering
system) together with the reference sequences of Rhodospirillum rubrum ATH
1.1.1T (EMBL accession number, M32020) and Escherichia coli (1, 2, 30).
The sequences of these bacteria were aligned with those of other representative
phototrophic and non-phototrophic members of proteobacteria which were from
the data libraries. For analyzing a phylogenetic relationships more precisely, the
homology values (percentage similarities) and the Knu~values were calculated by
computing 1,107 bases ranging between positions 2 and 1,380 with the exclusion of
the following regions: positions 74-96, 179-220, 454-478, 841-845, 1,106-1,035,

representatives of proteobacteria. Numbers indicate percentage bootstrap values of 100
replicates. For abbreviations and strain numbers see footnote of Table 1.

1,133-1,141 and 1,258-1,278 (Table 1). These regions were excluded because the
variations among the sequences were so large due to the many deletions and
insertions that exact alignment could not be expected, and because the inclusion of
too variable regions in the phylogenetic analysis would give unreliable relationships
at higher taxonomic ranks.
A phylogenetic tree reconstructed by applying the neighbor-joining method is
shown in Fig. 1. "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193Tand the two phototropic
isolates exhibited high levels of sequence relatedness (98.8% homology), and the
two isolates were completely homologous (Table 1). The isolates were phylogenetically close to "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193T.
"Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193Twas proved to belong to the a group
of the class Proteobacteria (24). However, the bacterium exhibited considerably
lower homology with Rhodospirillum rubrum ATH 1.1.1T (89.9%) and other

genera of the a group (87.6-89.8%) (Table 1). Based on homology values of 16S
rRNA sequences "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193Twas distinct at least at
generic level from Rhodospirillum rubrum ATH 1.1.1' which was the type strain of
the type species of the genus Rhodospirillum.
The presence of four subgroups in the Proteobacteria a group was proposed
based on oligonucleotide cataloging by Woese et al. (29). For analyzing the
phylogenetic place of "Rhodospirillum centenum" IAM 14193Tin the Proteobacteria, the 16S rRNA sequences of the following strains of proteobacteria were
computed: Rhodospirillum rubrum ATH 1.1.1T (M32020) of a-i subgroup, Rhodopseudomonas palustris ATCC 17001T (present result), Rhodopseudomonas acidophila strain 7050T (M34128), Rhodomicrobium vannielii strain EY33 (M34127)
and Agrobacterium tumefaciens DMS 30150 (M11223) (33) of a-2 subgroup,
Rhodobacter capsulatus ATCC 33303 (M34129) of a-3 subgroup, Erythrobacter
longus JCM 6170T(present result) of a-4 subgroup, Rhodocyclus purpureus "Ames"
6770T (M34132) and Pseudomonas testosteroni ATCC 11996T (Ml 1224) (32) of $
group, Chromatium vinosum (M26629) and Escherichia coli (1, 2, 30) of y group,
Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 (20) and Myxococcus xanthus MD207
(20) of o group, and Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense MSR-1T (23). The homology values among the genera of a group ranged continuously from 86.2 to 90.5%.
The homology values of 87.6 to 89.9% between each of the three cyst-forming
bacteria and the other members of a Proteobacteria were within this range.
However, the cyst-formers constituted a rather deep branch that was distinct from
any other lineages and could not be assigned to any of subgroups of the Proteobacteria a group.
The quinone systems of the species of the genus Rhodospirillum are compared
in Table 2. "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193Thad Q-9 but no rhodoquinones
or menaquinones, and its quinone system was different from that of the other
species (6, 7,10,11) . Furthermore, the organism had G + C content of 69.9 mol
(68.3 mol% (3)) that differed from the G + C content of 60.5-65.8% (Bd) or 62.163.5 mol% (Tm) of the other Rhodospirillum species (27) except for Rhodospirillum
salinarum (68.3%). The organism can be clearly differentiated chemotaxonomically from other members of Rhodospirillaceae by the combination of quinone system
and G + C content of the DNA.
The two cyst-forming isolates were confirmed to share the following characters
with "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193T;cyst formation, vibrioid to spiral cell
shape, bacteriochlorophill a, lamellae membrane system, Q-9 and G + C content of
DNA (69.2 and 69.8 mol% for MT-SP-2 and MT-SP-3, respectively). On the bases
of phylogenetic relatedness and phenotypic characteristics the two isolates are
considered to belong to the same taxon of "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193T
at least at the generic level.
"Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193Thas a morphologically unique characteristic that the cells of the strain form cysts when grown under aerobic conditions
in the dark. The cyst formation had not been known in the anoxygenic phototro-

phic bacteria until "Rhodospirillum centenum" was isolated (4), and this is an
important morphological characteristic to distinguish it from other genera of the
anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria.
The distinctness in phylogenetic relationships and chemotaxonomic and morphological characteristics shown above supports an idea that "Rhodospirillum
centenum" JAM 14193T should be placed in a genus apart from the genus Rhodospirillum. "Rhodospirillum centenum" was described and effectively published by
Favinger et al. in 1989 (4). The term "centenum" means "a hundred" in Latin and
was used as a specific epithet to commemorate "a century" that had passed since
1887 when the first description of a phototrophic bacterium was published by
Esmarch (3). However, it has not been validated and has no standing in bacterial
nomenclature. Therefore, we propose the establishment of a new genus and a new
species Rhodocista centenaria for "Rhodospirillum centenum" IAM 14193T. The
strain IAM 14193 (=ATCC 43720) is designated as the type strain of the species.
The two isolates, MT-SP-2 and MT-SP-3, are included in the genus Rhodocista.
However, the characterization of the two strains is not sufficient to establish their
taxonomic status in this paper. Therefore, we will report the species of these two
isolates in following paper.

The description is based on the previous publications by Favinger et al. (1989)
(4) and Stadtwald-Demchick et al. (1990) (25) for the strain ATCC 43720T, and
our present results.
Cells are vibrioid to spiral in shape, and 3 ,im long and 1 to 2 um wide. Motile
by means of long polar flagellum. Gram-negative. Internal photosynthetic membrane is present as lamellae lying parallel to the cytoplasmic membrane. Growth is
possible phototrophically in the light and microaerophilically or aerobically in the
dark. Photosynthetic pigments are bacteriochlorophill a and carotenoids of the
spirilloxanthin series. The cells are converted to thick-walled cysts which are
resistant to desiccation and heat, when aerobically grown on agar media. Major
quinone is Q-9. The G+C content of the DNA is 69-70 mol%.
The type species is Rhodocista centenaria.
Strains examined: IAM 14193, MT-SP-2, and MT-SP-3.
Description of Rhodocista centenaria sp. nov.

to commemorate a century after the publication of the first description of phototrophic bacteria in 1887. Rhodocista centenaria red basket (isolated) a century
(after the first publication of phototrophic bacterium)).
Cells are vibrioid to spiral in shape, and 3 ,cimlong and 1 to 2 ~tm wide. The
cells are actively motile by means of a single, long polar flagellum. Internal
phototrophic membrane is lamellae and lies parallel to the cytoplasmic membrane.
Color of anaerobically grown cultures is pink. Living cells show absorption
maxima at 800, 875 and 587 nm. Photosynthetic pigments are bacteriochlorophyll
a and carotenoids of the spirilloxanthin series.
Malate or other C4 dicarboxylic acids is not utilized for phototrophic growth
as the carbon sources. The carbon sources utilized are pyruvate, lactate and
acetate. Butyrate, caproate and caprylate also support phototrophic growth when
supplemented with bicarbonate (9 mM). Ammonia, dinitrogen, glutamate, glutamine and alanine are utilized as nitrogen sources. Biotin and vitamin B12 are
required as growth factors. Growth occurs at pH 6.8. Optimum temperature is
between 39 and 45°C with maximum of ca. 47°C. The cells grow aerobically as a
chemoheterotroph in darkness. With butyrate as the sole carbon source, the
spiral-shaped cells are converted to cysts which are desiccation- and heat-resistant;
the filter-fixed cysts kept at the temperature of 55°C for 2 days are viable. Major
quinone is Q-9. The G + C content of the DNA is 69.9 mol%. It was isolated from
a water sample of source pool of hot spring.
The type strain is IAM 14193 (=ATCC 43720).
This species is monotypic.

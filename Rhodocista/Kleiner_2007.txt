A new purple bacterium (strain T4), capable of heterotrophic aerobic and phototrophic
anaerobic growth, was isolated from waste water of a noodle factory near Hanoi, Vietnam.
A comparison of 16S rDNA sequences revealed its association with the genus Rhodocista.
The isolate, tentatively named “Rhodocista hanoiensis”, forms cysts after growth on butyratecontaining plates at 42 ∞C. The vegetative cells form short (under aerobic conditions) or long
curve-shaped rods. In contrast to other species of this genus T4 does not need any supplines
(growth factors, not synthesized by the organisms). Comparative studies of T4 with Rhodocista centenaria (Rhodospirillum centenum) and Rhodocista pekingensis revealed a remarkable physiological versatility regarding nutrient spectra and survival properties of this genus.
Key words: Rhodocista hanoiensis, Cyst Formation, 16S rDNA

Introduction
Phototrophic proteobacteria are distinguished
by their ability to carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis. They constitute a phylogenetically heterologous group, being found in three of the five proteobacteria classes together with heterotrophic
genera (Kawasaki et al., 1993). The spiral-shaped
strains among them were formerly collected in the
genus Rhodospirillum (Trüper and Imhoff, 1989).
When, however, more isolates of this group had
been analyzed biochemically and genetically Ð especially by sequencing of 16S rDNA Ð it became
evident, that description of the genus Rhodospirillum had to be revised: new genera like Rhodospira
(Pfennig et al., 1997) or Rhodocista (Kawasaki
et al., 1992) were established. The first Rhodocista
species, R. centenaria, had originally been described as Rhodospirillum centenum (Favinger
et al., 1989). So far two Rhodocista sp. have been
described: R. centenaria and R. pekingensis
(Zhang et al., 2003). Based on the use of 16S
rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes (Stoffels et
al., 2001) and the 16S rDNA sequences a distance
matrix tree shows close phylogenetic relationships
of Rhodocista with Azospirillum (see Fig. 1 and

We here report:
(i) isolation and characterization of a novel bacterium of the Rhodocista group (strain T4),
which differs considerably from the species
mentioned above, and therefore is proposed to
form a novel species, tentatively named Rhodocista hanoiensis, and
(ii) extensive comparative studies which document
the interesting versatility and adaptability of
the members of the genus Rhodocista.
Materials and Methods
Isolation and characterization of T4
Phototrophic bacteria were enriched from a
waste water pond [depth 1.5 m, pH 7.6 ð 0.4,
28 ∞C, organic load (1200 ð 600) mg/l BOD (biological oxygen demand), 3Ð6 mg/l sulfide] in Laphu, Hoaiduc, HaTay province (Vietnam) by anaerobic growth in light in screw cap tubes or
bottles filled with a medium containig (g/l):
KH2PO4 (1.0); MgCl2 · 6H2O (0.5); CaCl2 · 2H2O
(0.1); NH4Cl (1); NaCl (1); NaHCO3 (1); Na-acetate (3); 1 ml vitamin solution; 1 ml trace element
solution (Trüper and Imhoff, 1989); at pH 6.8Ð7.2.
Samples were diluted and streaked on agar plates
which were incubated anaerobically (under N2) at
30 ∞C in light from tungsten lamps. Pink-reddish
colonies were selected and repeatedly streaked on
plates and incubated anaerobically until they appeared pure as judged by microscopic inspection.

ID=lcl|1_25814&distmode=on&screenWidth=1024).

Purity of strains was also demonstrated by uniformity of growth on plates and of morphology of
cells after growth on selective media (see below).
Expression of pigments as function of oxygen
content in the gas phase was assessed by incubation under 0, 2.5, 5, 8, 10, 15 and 20% O2 in the
light.
DNA was isolated and purified according to
standard techniques (Sambrook et al., 1989). A
fragment of 16S rDNA was amplified and sequenced using standard primers described by
Wittke et al. (1997). The sequence was deposited
in the EMBL gene bank and received the accession number AJ580798.
Comparative physiological characterization of
Rhodocista centenaria, R. pekingensis and T4
Growth tests with different C (36.5 mm) or N
(18 mm) sources (see Table I) were carried out at
30 ∞C in liquid cultures under aerobic heterotrophic (5 ml on a rotary shaker) or anaerobic
phototrophic conditions (8 ml screw cap bottles
without gas phase, illumination by a tungsten
lamp) with the medium as described above, omitting NH4Cl when testing N sources, and omitting
acetate when testing C sources. When testing for
vitamin requirement, the vitamin solution (Trüper
and Imhoff, 1989) was omitted as well.

Miscellaneous techniques
Absorption spectra were recorded using intact
cells grown under phototrophic conditions and resuspended in a 60% sucrose solution. Morphology
and structure were observed by optical microscopy. Nitrogen fixation was measured by the acetylene reduction technique as described by Stewart et al. (1968).
Results
Characterization of Rhodocista T4
16S rDNA sequence alignments
From the enrichment cultures various strains of
the genera Rhodopseudomonas, Rhodospirillum
and Rhodobacter could be isolated as described.
Our attention was drawn to an isolate capable of
heterotrophic growth on benzoate, called strain
T4. Repeated PCR of its 16S rDNA yielded a 1491
bp fragment, the sequence of which, according to a
BLAST databank search, showed 99% similaritiy
with a vitamin B12 Ð requiring unpublished strain
(“Rhodocista xerospirillum”, acc. no. AM072288),
98% similaritiy with two other undescribed Rhodocista sp. (acc. nos. AJ401217, AJ401204) and
Rhodocista pekingensis (acc. no. AF523824; Zhang
et al., 2003), and 97% similarity with Rhodocista
centenaria (acc. no. D12701; Kawasaki et al., 1992)

and un-characterized Rhodocista sp. (acc. nos.
D12702, D12703).
Other properties of strain T4
Vegetative cells of T4 had a vibroid to rod shape
with dimensions of (0.7 ¥ 2) μm under aerobic
(Fig. 2a) and (0.7 ¥ 4) μm under anaerobic growth
conditions (Fig. 2b).
In vivo absorption spectra of anaerobically cultivated cells showed maxima at 410, 480, 510, 590,
800 and 875 nm, indicative of the presence of bacteriochlorophyll a and spirilloxanthin-like pigments. A similar spectrum was reported for R. pekingensis (Zhang et al., 2003).
Production of red pigments was O2-dependent:
the pigments appeared only in a gas phase containing less than 5% O2.
Cyst formation of T4
Cyst formation was induced as described by
Berleman and Bauer (2004), by aerobic mainte-

nance for several days at 42 ∞C on plates containing NH4Cl and butyrate as N and C sources, respectively. Their development closely followed the
pattern as cited above: after 1 d some cells began
to swell (Fig. 2c) and finally formed tetrads like R.
centenaria (Figs. 2d, e). These cysts resumed vegetative growth when cultivated at optimum temperatures.
Comparative studies of Rhodocista strains
Survival at non-growing conditions
In a comparative set of experiments the three
strains were plated on agar plates containing
NH4Cl and butyrate, and incubated at 42 ∞C for 4
months, so that the plates dried completely. Cells
were scraped off, transferred into LB (Luria-Bertani) medium and incubated aerobically. Growth
was visible after 2 d (R. pekingensis and T4) or
after 5 d (R. centenaria). In another experiment
vegetative cells were incubated in liquid ammo-

Table I. C and N spectra of Rhodocista strains. Aerobic growth in liquid cultures (5 ml on a rotary shaker) was
conducted with cells pre-grown in an ammonium/acetate medium and washed twice with water to remove all nutrients. Anaerobic growth in liquid cultures (8 ml screw cap bottles without gas phase) was conducted with cells treated
as above. Vitamins were supplied as required (see Table II). Results in square brackets are from Favinger et al.
(1989) (R. centenaria, Rce), Stadtwald-Demchick et al. (1990) (Rce), and Zhang et al. (2003) (R. pekingensis, Rpk).

Light microscopic appearance of Rhodocista T4 (stained with carbol fuchsin) after growth at different conditions: (a) after aerobic cultivation for 3 d in liquid ammonium/acetate medium (30 ∞C); (b) after anaerobic cultivation for 3 d in liquid ammonium/acetate medium (30 ∞C); (c) after 1 d on ammonium/butyrate plate (42 ∞C); (d)
after 2 and 3 d on ammonium/butyrate plate (42 ∞C); (e) after 3 d or more on ammonium/butyrate plate (42 ∞C).

nium butyrate medium and supplied with 10%
NaCl. Incubation at 37 ∞C gradually resulted in
complete loss of water within 4 months. The cultures additionally were dried at 45 ∞C for one
week. After resuspension in water, aliquots were
transferred to LB medium and incubated. Growth
of all strains was visible after 5 d. Microscopic inspections showed that cultures were pure and
showed the typical characteristics of the original
strains.
Utilization of C and N sources
The spectrum of C and N sources for the Rhodocista strains, especially T4 is rather wide (Table
I): apart from many mono- and dicarboxylic acids,
the organisms can use a number of carbohydrates
and benzoate as C and most amino acids as N
sources. Like other phototrophs, T4 is able to fix
N2 anaerobically. In contrast to other Rhodocista,
T4 does not require any supplines like vitamins
(Table II).

Miscellaneous
Apart from vitamin requirement other characteristic differences are listed in Table II.
Discussion
The 16S rDNA sequence data as well as the
physiological characteristics and ability of cyst formation demonstrate, that T4 is a novel species belonging to the genus Rhodocista. The physiological
comparison reveals a remarkable versatility as to
C and N source utilization of this genus. Rhodocista species are methylotrophs, being able to aerobically use methanol, formiate and methylamine
as C sources. Furthermore because of their ability
to form cysts, all strains can survive severe drought
and salt stress.

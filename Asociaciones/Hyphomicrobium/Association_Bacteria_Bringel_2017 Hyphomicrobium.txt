D ichloromethane DCM is one of the most used industrial halogenated solvents worldwide and its toxicity and substantial release into the environment are of serious concern 1 2 
he genome of Hyphomicrobium sp . strain GJ21 was sequenced using Illumina technology 
enome sequence of the dichloromethanedegrading bacterium Hyphomicrobium sp . strain GJ21 
ichloromethane as the sole carbon source for Hyphomicrobium sp . strain DM2 under denitriﬁcation conditions 
omplete genome sequence of the chloromethane-degrading Hyphomicrobium sp . strain MC1 
he genome also possesses the strongly conserved dcm islet of dcmRABC genes found in all bacteria with dcmA-encoded DCM dehalogenase 3 , including Hyphomicrobium denitriﬁcans ATCC 51888 of known genome sequence 16 
enes associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction and complete denitriﬁcation to N2 were also identiﬁed as expected from the known ability of Hyphomicrobium strains to grow with DCM with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen 17 
everal other Hyphomicrobium genome sequences of isolated strains 16 18–21 http //www.genoscope.cns.fr/agc/microscope or reconstructed from metagenomes ( 22 are now publicly available 
omparative genomics of the Hyphomicrobium genus will support ongoing experimental studies on bacterial adaptation to growth with halogenated methanes for bioremediation applications 
he Hyphomicrobium sp . strain GJ21 genome sequence was deposited in GenBank under the accession number CDHO00000000 
omplete genome sequence of Hyphomicrobium nitrativorans strain NL23 a denitrifying bacterium isolated from bioﬁlm of a methanol-fed denitriﬁcation system treating seawater at the Montreal Biodome 
omparative analysis of denitrifying activities of Hyphomicrobium nitrativorans Hyphomicrobium denitriﬁcans and Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii 
yphomicrobium sp . strain GJ21 isolated after prolonged adaptation from a mixture of activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant and soil samples from polluted sites 12 has been extensively used as a model for bioremediation of DCM in bioreactor studies e.g. , see reference 13 and references therein

nlike many other Hyphomicrobium species strain VS was unable to grow anaerobically on methanol with nitrate as electron acceptor 
MS-grown cells respired sulfide thiosulfate methanethiol dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide 
n order to see if energy could be derived from its respiration sulfide was added at 3 m M feed concentration to methanol limited continuous cultures D = 0.023 and 0.1 h l 
pon addition of limiting amounts of sulfide 80 M during respiration measurements the ratio of oxygen consumed per mole of sulfide added was 1-1.2 :1 for methanol-grown cultures indicating an initial oxidation product at the level of thiosulfate 
ndeed DMS-grown cells respired thiosulfate although at a slower rate than sulfide 
n Hyphomicrobium EG these enzymes were constitutive but the levels could be enhanced by addition of sulfide Suylen et al . 1986 
he results indicated that cells quickly oxidize sulfide up to the level of thiosulfate 
ndeed thiosulfate could be identified by HPLC analysis as an intermediate during sulfide respiration data not shown 
hiosulfate formation was detected in methylamine- plus sulfide-grown chemostat cultures of Hyphomicrobium EG Suylen et al . 1986 and oxidation of sulfide to thiosulfate and elemental sulfur was reported recently for Hyphomicrobium neptunium by Sasahira et al . 1991 1992

Abbreviations VSC volatile sulfur compounds DMS dimethylsulfide DMDS-dimethyldisulfide DMTS dimethyltrisutfide MT methanethiol DMSO dimethylsulfoxide Introduction Formation of volatile sulfur compounds VSC in particular dimethylsulfide DMS has been observed in various microbial ecosystems such as soils algal mats compost stacks and sewage treatment systems , as well as in several industrial processes such as brewing and paper manufacture Kelly & Smith 1990 
he production of VSC causes environmental problems due to their high odor index and toxicity 
uch a filter should be applicable for treatment of waste gases originating from for instance indoor composting facilities Derikx et al . 1991 and sewage treatment plants Buisman et al . 1990 
iological deodorization of VSC is now attracting attention because of the low operating cost and high ability as compared with chemical or physical processes Kanagawa & Kelly 1986 Shoda 1991 
he isolation and characterization of a Hyphomicrobium species able to utilize DMS as a carbon and energy source and initial attempts to use this 106 strain for purification of DMS-containing air streams are presented in this study . with 0.2 M NaOH 
ulfide was sterilized under nitrogen and separately introduced under the liquid level of the culture . Materials and methods Respiration measurements MeSa A mineral medium was used for enrichment and cultivation 
he medium contained in g 1-~ : K2HPO4 0.4 KH2PO4 1.0 NH4CI 0.4 MgC12 • 6H20 0.1 CaClz • 2H20 0.01 Na2CO3 0.5 and 2 ml 1-1 trace element solution 
ubstrates tested for growth experiments were added to a final concentration of 10 mM except for formaldehyde and sulfur compounds which were tested at I raM . Enrichment and isolation Enrichment of DMS-utilizing bacteria using activated sewage sludge as inoculum was achieved at room temperature in mineral medium containing DMS at a low concentration 0.015 mM liquid concentration during the first transfers and 0,4 mM for the following ones as the only source of carbon and energy 
nrichment was performed in 120 ml stoppered bottles containing 20 ml medium and DMS was added by syringe after depletion of DMS new amounts were added 
fter 6 transfers agar plates composed of the same mineral medium plus 1.5 % w/v agar were inoculated with the enrichment culture and incubated at 30 °C in ajar containing 15 mmol 1-1 DMS in the gas phase 
dditional purity tests were performed with mineral medium enriched with glucose yeast extract and tryptone each 2 g 1-1 
ates were expressed as nmol 02 rain-I mg protein-1 and were corrected for endogenous respiration . Preparation of cell-free extracts Cell-free extracts were prepared by suspending ceils 0.5 g wet weight per ml in 50 mM Tris-HC1 buffer pH 7.0 and breaking them by passage through a French pressure cell at 110 MPa 
he mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HC1 buffer pH 8.2 1 mol MT and about 0.15 mg of protein 
AD +and DCPIP-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase were assayed according to Suylen et al . t986 
eaction mixtures contained 25 mM glycytglycine buffer pH 7.4 0.24 mM NADH , 0.25 mM oxaloacetate and an appropriate amount of cell extract about 0.15 mg protein per ml 
MScontaining air was saturated with water and supplied at the bottom of the cylinder at room temperature 
he medium was pH regulated between 6.7 and 7.0 by simultaneous addition of fresh medium and a NaOH solution 0.2 M 
he filter was inoculated by replacing 400 ml of the recirculation fluid with a culture of Hyphomicrobium VS with an optical density at 600 nm OD600 of about 1.0 . Analytical procedures DMS and MT were determined gaschromatographically as described earlier Derikx et al . 1990 
ulfate and thiosulfate were determined using the HPLC-system described by Van Alebeek et al . 1992 . Results Isolation and characterization of a DMS-utilizing bacterium A DMS-utilizing bacterium was successfully enriched using activated sludge as inoculum in a mineral medium in which DMS was present as carbon and energy source 
fter streaking on agar plates and incubation for about 14 days in a jar containing DMS and air in the gas phase small colonies were visible 
number of colonies were selected and all were able to grow on methanol 
ne colony was subcultured further and designated Hyphomicrobium strain VS 
yphae were up to three times the length of the cell and produced buds 
otility was observed for small cells and maturing buds 
yphomicrobium VS was unable to grow on a complex medium containing glucose yeast extract and tryptone 
rowth was observed between pH 6.0 and 8.0 with an optimum at pH 7.0 
he temperature optimum was 30 °C . Growth of Hyphomicrobium VS in batch and continuous culture The maximum growth rate # naz on methanol in batch culture was 0.14 4- 0.01 h -1 n = 6 
alues found for max and YCH3OH in a continuous culture were 0.12 h -1 and 13.4 ± 1.1 n = 7 g dry weight mole-1 respectively at a dilution rate D of 0A h -1 
ue to toxicity of DMS and acidification of the medium during growth studies with batch cultures on DMS were not easy to perform 
o overcome this problem Hyphomicrobium VS was first grown batch-wise in the chemostat on methanol 60 raM after which DMS addition was started and the D was set at 0.02 h -1 
ediumconcentrationfor methanoland DMS were 20 mM and 15 raM respectively . c Methanolexhaustedculture adaptedto DMS . a n.d. = not determined . e Respirationof DMSO using batch-growncells on methanolwas foundto be zero . ing the D to 0.04 h-1 enhanced the DMS-respiration rate to 444 nmol 02 min -1 mg protein-I after one week 
ield measurements were negatively influenced by cell attachment to the walt and inner parts of the chemostat vessel 
he substrate affinity constants K ) for DMS and methanol as estimated from the respiration rates at different substrate concentrations were both around 3 M 
oreover DMS and MT respiration were not induced 
he same ratio was found both for the methanol plus sulfide- and for the DMS-grown chemostat cultures 
fter addition of DMS < 0.15 raM to a methanoldepleted batch culture the capacity to respire methylated sulfides was observed after a further 4 h incubation period and a maximum respiration rate of DMS of about t50 nmol O2 rain- 1 mg protein- l was achieved after 18 h 
ells grown on DMSO were also able to respire MT DMS thiosulfate and to a much lesser extent methanol . Enzyme activities Cell-free extracts of methanol-grown Hyphomicrobium VS cells displayed high activities of methanol dehydrogenase formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase Table 2 
oreover high activities of malate dehydrogenase hydroxypyruvate reductase and catalase were measured 
his indicates that the methanol assimilation of strain VS is similar to that of other Hyphomicrobium species and follows the serine pathway Harder et al . 1973 
MS-grown cells also possessed the above-mentioned carbon assimilating and dissimilating enzyme activities data not shown

any growth characteristics and respiration features of our isolate were similar to Hyphomicrobium EG isolated by Suylen et al . 1986 and Hyphomicrobium S isolated by De Bont et al . 1981 
n this respect it seems more related to Hyphomicrobium I55 recently isolated by Zhang et al . 1991 which was able to use DMS DMSO and methanol for growth 
ur isolate was even more versatile since growth also occurred on formaldehyde formate and methylated amines and to a lesser extent on ethanol 
ulfide respiration was constitutive and occurred at a high rate 
oth polyurethane and lava stone appeared to be good carrier materials for immobilizing Hyphomicrobium VS in trickling filters

arbon was assimilated via the serine pathway 
s a result of more stringent rules on the emission of harmful gases to the atmosphere the need was felt for a DMS-utilizing microorganism which could be used in the construction of a biological filter for DMS removal 
ulfide was added to a methanollimited culture to study the effect on the yield 
ethanol was added to the medium after sterilization to a final concentration of 20 raM 
MS as growth substrate was added by leading an air stream containing DMS through the culture liquid 
fter centrifugation at 40,000 x g at 4 °C for 20 rain the supernatant crude extract was directly used or stored at 20 oC . Enzyme assays Methanol dehydrogenase was assayed at pH 9.0 according to Duine et al . 1978 
ethanethiol MT oxidase activity was determined gaschromatographically by measuring the disappearance of MT in the headspace of an incubation mixture total volume t.2 ml in a stoppered 100 ml bottle 
AD+-dependent malate dehydrogenase was assayed by following the oxaloacetatedependent oxidation of NADH at 340 nm 
he air flow is expressed as space velocity i.e. the flow rate divided by the biofilter volume 
very 30 min 0.5 liter of medium was sprayed on top of the packing material via a perforated plate

or cellfree extracts protein was determined with the Bio-Rad Bio-Rad Laboratories Richmond CA USA protein reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard 
or protein analysis of whole cells the Lowry method was used 
ts methylotrophic nature was shown by the ability to grow aerobically on a broad spectrum of reduced Cl-compounds Table 1 
east extract was stimulatory but did not increase the yield in batch cultures grown on methanol 
he DMS concentration in the air stream was 100 tool I -~ which in the absence of consumption would result in an equilibrium concentration of 1.5 mM in the liquid phase

hen the organism was grown on DMSO in batch culture a btmax of 0.065 + 0.015 h -1 n = 3 was found 
he high affinity for DMS resulted in very low concentrations of DMS in the gas outlet of the chemostat 
either MT nor HaS could be demonstrated in the gas outlet 
owever for the latter cultures the respiration curves were biphasic the final rates were significantly higher compared to the 109 endogenous respiration indicating a slow sequential oxidation of the initial product 
ethanol-grown cells did not respire thiosulfate but this activity could be rapidly induced by the addition of thiosulfate 5 raM to the chemostat 
ll attempts to demonstrate in cell-free extracts DMS mono-oxygenase the enzyme proposed to be responsible for the first step in the assimilation of DMS were not successful . Application of Hyphomicrobium VS in air biofiltration A biofilter 2.5 1 volume with polyurethane as carrier material was started up by inoculation with a DMSadapted culture of Hyphomicrobium VS Fig . 1 
utlet DMS concentrations during start-up were below the detection limit < 0.6 nmol 1-1 
fter 4 days the concentration was increased to 4 mol 1-1 resulting in a transient increase in outlet DMS concentration 
fter 11 days the space velocity was increased to 24 h 1 
t day 23 the space velocity was increased further to about 100 h-1 with a concomitant decrease in the DMS concentration of the inlet to 1.4 mol 1- l 
o other VSC were detectable in the outlet 
biofilter of the same dimensions packed with lava stone was started by inoculation with a methanolgrown culture of Hyphomicrobium VS not yet adapted to DMS Fig . 2 
apid adaptation to DMS was obvious from the high removal rate from the first day on 2.3 mmoI I-1 d l 
n increase in the inlet concentration at day 24 did not increase the outlet concentration indicating that the biofilter was not operating at maximum capacity 
ompared to the second week during which the filter was operated at the same loading the removal capacity had clearly increased at the end of the experiment . Discussion By using low non-toxic concentrations of DMS we succeeded in the isolation of a Hyphomicrobium 110 Table 2 
he dotted line indicates the air space velocity . species designated Hyphomicrobium strain VS 
n methanol the growth rate 0.14 h 1 is among the highest reported for hyphomicrobia Harder & Attwood 1978 
urther a biofilter inoculated with methanolgrown cells acquired the ability to remove DMS from an airstream within one day 
MS mono-oxygenase activity the first enzyme in DMS metabolism was not found in cell-free extracts 
possible explanation may be that this enzyme needs a functional electron transport chain to provide the reducing equivalents for DMS-monooxygenase 
owever for the latter organism methylated or 111 inorganic sulfur compounds were not reported to act as carbon or energy source 
hether the S-metabolic pathway of D M S will gain energy remains to be studied 
his value is still well above the odor threshold level 
owever the inlet concentrations applied exceeded that of most industrial air streams so outlet concentrations below the odor threshold may be achievable at lower inlet concentrations 
hus far efficient removal o f volatile sulfur compounds was found by the use o f peat biofilters inoculated with Hyphomicrobium I55 Zhang et al . 1991 Thiobacillus species Cho et al . 1991a b 1992a or mixed cultures Cho et al , 1992b 
emoval rates reported for DMS are in the same order of magnitude as our values 
eat biofilters may have a disadvantage if acidification occurs as a results o f microbial degradation o f the contaminants present in the waste gas 
his problem can be circumvented by spraying the peat with water Cho et al . 1992a 
n this type o f reactor the waste gas is forced to rise through a column with inert packing material on which the suitable micororganisms are immobilized 
urther the liquid recirculation allows control o f optimal physiological conditions i.e. pH medium addition 
he suitability of such a biofilter with immobilized Thiobacillus thioparus was demonstrated for the removal of volatile sulfur compounds Tanji et al . 1989

r o m short-term experiments circa 45 days it was concluded that high concentrations o f DMS 1 2 m o l 1- t were removed very efficiently at relatively high space velocities up to 100 h-1 : final outlet concentrations obtained were 0.05 tool 1-1 1 ppm 
atalase was assayed according to Haywood & Large 1981 . Air biofiltration A lab-scale biofilter trickling filter principle was constructed of a glass-cylinder 90 mm ~ x 450 mm 107 packed either with oblong pieces 15 cm in length of polyurethane having a T-shaped cross-section I0 x 10 x 3 mm , or with lava stone 8-16 mm 0 
he yield Y amounted to 13.2 ± 0.7 n = 5 g dry weight mole- 1 
hiosulfate is then further oxidized at a lower rate 
he use o f a biological trickling filter is a good alternative 
n extra advantage ofHyphomicrobium VS for odor treatment is its ability to degrade methylated amines 
he pH was maintained at 7.0 by automatic titration Respiration rates of whole cells were measured polarographically in a Biological Oxygen Monitor with a Clark-type oxygen electrode at 30 °C 
his gradual increase resulted in a more or less constant . high outlet concentration of 1.1 mol 1-1 from day 27 onwards 
xtracts from DMS-grown cells further contained a MT oxidase activity of about 200 nmol rain-1 mg protein- 1 
ttempts to demonstrate this enzyme in Hyphomicrobium EG also failed Suylen 1988 , while in Hyphomicrobium S a very low activity 0.001 tool rain -1 mg protein -1 could be measured De Bont et al . 1981 
MS concentrations above 1 mM proved to be growth inhibiting 
urity of cultures was checked microscopically after growth in defined medium 
he latter medium does not allow growth of methylotrophic hyphomicrobia 
ow concentrations of DMS were a prerequisite since DMS concentrations above 1 mM proved to be growth inhibiting

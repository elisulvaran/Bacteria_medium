ethanol dehydrogenase (MDH) belonging to Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii appeared as the most constantly expressed protein in the studied consortium 
esare 11, 70124 Bari, Italy  4  Otto-von-Guericke University, Bioprocess Engineering, Universit√§tsplatz 2, 39106 Magdeburg, Germany  belonging to Hyphomicrobium spp. revealed a predominant methylotrophic metabolism, and H. zavarzinii appeared as a key actor in the studied microbial community 
oreover, the BUnipept metaproteomics analysis pipeline^ (Unipept 3.1) was applied to all peptides, and it confirmed the Hyphomicrobium genus as the most prevalent in the consortium, as shown in Online Resource 2 [13] 
etaproteome analysis showed that 31 database hits of identified proteins were taxonomically affiliated to the genus Hyphomicrobium, of whom 17 referred to H. zavarzinii, 9 to Hyphomicrobium nitrativorans, and 3 to Hyphomicrobium denitrificans

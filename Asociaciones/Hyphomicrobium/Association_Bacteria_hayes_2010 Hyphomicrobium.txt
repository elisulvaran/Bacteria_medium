pecific growth rates of 0.099 hⴚ1 and 0.11 hⴚ1 were determined for Hyphomicrobium spp . and Thiobacillus spp. respectively growing on DMS at pH 7 
hen the pH of the medium was decreased from pH 7 to pH 5 the specific growth rate of Hyphomicrobium spp . decreased by 85 % with a near 100-fold decline in the yield of Hyphomicrobium 16S rRNA gene copies in the mixed culture 
hen methanol was used as a substrate the specific growth rate of Hyphomicrobium spp . declined much less over the same pH range up to 30 % while the yield of 16S rRNA gene copies declined by only 50 % 
he results of these mixed-culture batch experiments indicate that the increased DMS removal rates observed in previous studies of biofilters cotreating DMS and methanol are due to the proliferation of DMS-degrading Hyphomicrobium spp . on methanol at pH levels not conducive to high growth rates on DMS alone . 5424 APPL

Bacteriawide Bayesian phylogeny revealed that the enrichment culture was composed of a wide variety of bacteria and a comparison of this clone library with one constructed from a biofilter treating DMS alone revealed three groups of bacteria Hyphomicrobium Thiobacillus and Chitinophaga that appear to be tightly correlated to DMS degradation in these systems 16 
inimum evolution phylogenies of the Hyphomicrobium and Thiobacillus genera and the Chitinophaga family reveal that while there is genetic diversity in the 16S rRNA gene sequences within each of these groups the identified clones from Thiobacillus spp . tend to be much less genetically diverse in terms of evolutionary distance than clones from Hyphomicrobium spp . and Chitinophaga spp .

N DMS Hyphomicrobium spp . and Thiobacillus spp . in the literature 
n the case of Hyphomicrobium spp. experiments on pure cultures were all carried out at pH 7 only 
owever a study of an enrichment culture believed to be dominated by Hyphomicrobium spp . observed by microscopy had a maximum DMS degradation rate somewhere between pH 6.0 and 7.0 
his is consistent with observations in the enrichment culture in this study that showed that the specific growth rate and by extension the DMS degradation rate of Hyphomicrobium spp . decreased by up to 85 % when the pH was decreased from pH 7 to pH 5 
urthermore no sulfate inhibition was observed in the Hyphomicrobium enrichment culture for sulfate concentrations below 24 g SO42⫺/ liter 33 a sulfate concentration that exceeds any sulfate concentration measured in this study by at least an order of magnitude , suggesting that the decline in the specific growth rate is due to pH rather than sulfate inhibition 
owever in a biotrickling filter study where nearly 100 % removal efficiencies were achieved and the microbial community was typically composed of more than 10 % Thiobacillus spp . and less than 0.1 % Hyphomicrobium spp . on a total bacterial 16S rRNA gene basis the DMS degradation rate remained robust ⬃90 % removal efficiency as the pH of the recirculation medium was adjusted to pH 5 over the course of 1 day 31 
hile decreasing the pH of the medium from pH 7 to pH 5 had a deleterious effect on the growth kinetics of Hyphomicrobium spp . on DMS it had only a minimal effect on the growth kinetics of Hyphomicrobium spp . on methanol 
t has long been known that Hyphomicrobium spp . could be enriched from environmental samples equally quickly in media at pH values between 5.5 and 8.0 2 
his suggests that that the specific growth rates for Hyphomicrobium spp . are similar within this pH range which is consistent with results in this study for Hyphomicrobium spp . growing on methanol 
he difference with respect to pH in growth rates on methanol and DMS for Hyphomicrobium spp . could be the result of different pH optima of the enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway of these compounds 
n Hyphomicrobium spp. methanol is first oxidized to formaldehyde by a methanol dehydrogenase 12 while DMS is oxidized to methyl mercaptan and formaldehyde by a DMS monooxygenase 7 36 , and methyl mercaptan is further oxidized to hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde by a methyl mercaptan oxidase 37 
owever methanol dehydrogenases have been shown to remain stable and retain their activity after incubation for 45 h in buffer from pH 5 to pH 10 with the optimum activity occurring Downloaded from http //aem.asm.org/ on February 15 2018 by guest estimate biomass versus volatile suspended solids VSS , for example since the maximum specific growth rate measured in this study for Hyphomicrobium spp . on methanol 0.15 h⫺1 is similar to the maximum specific growth rates on methanol for Hyphomicrobium VS 0.14 h⫺1 27 and Hyphomicrobium X ( 0.10 h⫺1 ( 15 
he increased specific growth rates of Hyphomicrobium spp . and Thiobacillus spp . on DMS in this enrichment culture may be the result of the mixed culture improving growth on DMS relative to pure cultures 
iomass yields of both Hyphomicrobium spp . and Thiobacillus spp . were significantly lower in the enrichment culture at pH 7 than both the theoretical yield calculated using bioenergetics and biomass yields of pure cultures grown on DMS reported in the literature 
ince the enrichment culture is a mixed culture both Hyphomicrobium spp . and Thiobacillus spp . are growing on DMS and there is no way to determine how much of the DMS substrate each group is consuming leading to an underestimation of their respective yields 
irst when methanol was the substrate a similar approximately 65 % underestimate of the biomass yield was observed at pH 7 for Hyphomicrobium spp . compared to the biomass yield of Hyphomicrobium VS in pure culture 
econd DMS was completely converted to sulfate in the pH 7 experiments and 16S rRNA gene copies from Hyphomicrobium spp . and Thiobacillus spp . accounted for the bulk of bacterial 16S rRNA genes in the batch experiments 
he effect of the pH of the medium had different effects on the kinetics of Hyphomicrobium spp . and Thiobacillus spp 
hile there was a clear deterioration in the ability of Hyphomicrobium spp . to grow on DMS as the pH decreased from pH 7 to pH 5 Thiobacillus spp . maintained their ability to grow on DMS as the pH decreased from pH 7 to pH 5

his and the fact that Hyphomicrobium spp . can be isolated almost equally as quickly from environmental samples from pH 5.5 to pH 8.0 suggest a wide pH range in which methanol dehydrogenase is active in vivo 2 
nzymatic studies on the metabolism of DMS by Hyphomicrobium spp . are limited 
uylen et al . 37 reported that the pH optimum for methyl mercaptan oxidase in Hyphomicrobium EG was pH 8.2 
t is possible that the higher pH optimum of methyl mercaptan oxidase and perhaps of DMS monooxygenase results in the more rapid decline of the specific growth rate of Hyphomicrobium spp . on DMS than on methanol as the pH decreases from pH 7 to pH 5 
irst they highlight the importance of pH control in biofiltration and other biotechnological systems designed to remove DMS where the microbial community is comprised of a significant quantity of Hyphomicrobium spp 
his was evident in our previous study in which the biofilter treating DMS alone was characterized by chronically low DMS removal rates and removal efficiencies in a community where Hyphomicrobium spp . accounted for 10 % of the bacterial population on a 16S rRNA gene basis 16 
econd these results show that in systems where pH may be difficult to control such as traditional biofiltration systems methanol addition can lead to higher DMS removal rates and removal efficiencies under conditions that are not conducive to high growth rates of Hyphomicrobium spp . on DMS alone 
he half-velocity constant KS of the biofilter microbial community was determined to be 0.2 ␮M 49 but even if the biofilter microbial community had a KS on DMS similar to that of Hyphomicrobium VS 3 ␮M ( 27 it would be expected that the specific growth rate at pH 7 would be approximately 0.07 h⫺1 , not 0.012 h⫺1 , which is a value that is more analogous to the specific growth rate at pH 5 in the batch studies 
n other words the pH conditions in these biofilters resulted in much lower specific growth rates than can be achieved by Hyphomicrobium spp . at pH 7 
n the biofilters cotreating DMS and methanol in our previous study Hyphomicrobium spp . were capable of growing at much higher specific growth rates on methanol than on DMS throughout the pH regime that was employed in these biofilters 
his resulted in the proliferation of DMS-degrading Hyphomicrobium spp . that consumed both DMS and methanol with the increase in Hyphomicrobium spp . being proportional to the increase in DMS degradation in these systems 16 
his suggests that these Hyphomicrobium spp . still grow at a lower than optimal specific growth rate on DMS in the presence of methanol but that methanol addition results in an increase in the concentration of Hyphomicrobium APPL

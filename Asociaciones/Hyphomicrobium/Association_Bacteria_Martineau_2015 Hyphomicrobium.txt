Comparative Analysis of Denitrifying Activities of Hyphomicrobium nitrativorans, Hyphomicrobium denitrificans, and Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii Christine Martineau,* Florian Mauffrey, Richard Villemur INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier, Laval, QC, Canada  H  yphomicrobium spp. are restricted facultative methylotrophs that reproduce by budding at the tip of a polar prostheca 
espite the presence of denitrifying Hyphomicrobium spp. in many environments or denitrification processes, genetic and physiological information regarding their denitrification capacities is poorly documented 
his could be related to the fact that Hyphomicrobium spp. can be hard to culture, especially under denitrifying conditions

owever, denitrifying Hyphomicrobium species are poorly characterized, and very few studies have provided information on the genetic and physiological aspects of denitrification in pure cultures of these bacteria 
his is a comparative study of three denitrifying Hyphomicrobium species, H. denitrificans ATCC 51888, H. zavarzinii ZV622, and a newly described species, H. nitrativorans NL23, which was isolated from a denitrification system treating seawater 
oncurrently with these differences observed at the genetic level, important differences in the denitrification capacities of these Hyphomicrobium species were determined 
yphomicrobium nitrativorans strain NL23T (ATCC BAA-2476), Hyphomicrobium denitrificans strain XT (ATCC 51888), and Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii strain ZV622T (ATCC 27496) were used in this study 
educed amino acid sequences derived from the napA, narG, nirK, cnorB, and nosZ genes that were retrieved from the genomes of the three Hyphomicrobium species, as well as sequences of their closest relatives and representative sequences of the Proteobacteria, were aligned by using ClustalW, and phylogenetic trees were constructed by using the neighbor-joining algorithm (30) with the Poisson correction method in MEGA version 6.06 (31) 
acteria were cultured in modified Hyphomicrobium medium 337a (32) [composition (per liter), 1.3 g KH2PO4, 1.13 g Na2HPO4, 0.5 g (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 g MgSO4·7H2O, 3.09 mg CaCl2·2H2O, 2.0 mg FeSO4·7H2O, 1.0 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.88 mg MnSO4·4H2O, and 10 ␮g CuCl2·2H2O (pH 7.5)] at 30°C 
n order to assess the capacity of the three Hyphomicrobium species to achieve complete denitrification, the N2O concentrations in the headspace of cultures incubated with and without 10% (vol/ vol) acetylene, an inhibitor of the nitrous oxide reductase, were compared (33)

or each Hyphomicrobium species, the control gene was chosen from among the two genes tested (rpoB and dnaG) by using RefFinder (http://www.leonxie.com /referencegene.php), an online tool that allows the selection of the appropriate control gene based on the lowest variability according to geNorm (37), Normfinder (38), BestKeeper (39), and the comparative ⌬⌬CT method (40) 
he statistical significance of the ⌬⌬CT values was tested by Student’s t test (two tailed, heteroscedastic).

ll three Hyphomicrobium species studied here possess gene clusters encoding the full set of enzymes necessary to achieve complete denitrification, although they differ greatly in their nitrate reductases (Table 3) 
hylogenetic analyses were performed on the deduced amino acid sequences of genes encoding the catalytic subunits of the different reductases (NapA, NarG, NirK, cNorB, and NosZ) found in the three Hyphomicrobium species 
he three Hyphomicrobium species cultivated under aerobic conditions with or without the addition of 14.3 mM NaNO3 showed similar growth curves 
hen incubated under denitrifying conditions at the same nitrate concentration, the three Hyphomicrobium species had the capacity to grow and to completely eliminate nitrate without nitrite accumulation, although growth was much slower than that under aerobic conditions (Fig. 2) 
he addition of acetylene led to the accumulation of N2O in the headspace of the vials, while no (H. nitrativorans) or less (H. denitrificans and H. zavarzinii) N2O accumulation was observed in cultures incubated without  Denitriﬁcation in Three Hyphomicrobium Species  cultured in triplicate under denitrifying conditions with an initial concentration of 14.3 mM (diamonds), 42.8 mM (squares), 71.4 mM (triangles), or 107 mM (crosses) NaNO3 
he effect of increasing nitrate concentrations on the growth and denitrification kinetics of the three Hyphomicrobium species was assessed under denitrifying conditions, with the NaNO3 concentration ranging from 14.3 to 107 mM (200 to 1,500 mg NO3N/liter) (Fig. 2) 
o further evaluate whether the interaction between nitrate and NaCl could lead to significant differences in growth and denitrification rates in the three Hyphomicrobium species, we carried out a factorial experiment using two different concentrations of each of the two factors in question 
nder the culture conditions tested, H. nitrativorans was found to be the most efficient of the three Hyphomicrobium species evaluated 
ur results showed the influence of nitrate and NaCl on the growth and denitrification of the three Hyphomicrobium species 
he three Hyphomicrobium species were cultured under the following denitrifying conditions: (i) 14.3 mM NaNO3 and 0% NaCl, (ii) 71.4 mM NaNO3 and 0% NaCl, (iii) 14.3 mM NaNO3 and 0.5% NaCl, and (iv) 71.4 mM NaNO3 and 0.5% NaCl 
he three Hyphomicrobium species were cultured under aerobic conditions, under aerobic conditions with 14.3 mM NaNO3, or under denitrifying conditions with 14.3 mM NaNO3 
owever, the incubation of this bacterial species under denitrifying conditions led to a strong increase in the relative gene expression level of narG1 (36.4-fold), a slight but significant increase in the level of narG2 (1.8-fold), and a significant decrease in the level of napA (⫺8.3-fold) (Fig. 5F).

s expected, H. nitrativorans also demonstrated better tolerance to NaCl than the two other Hyphomicrobium species tested and showed small but significant increases in the napA and nirK relative gene expression levels when NaCl was added to the growth medium

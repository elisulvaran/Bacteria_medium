enes associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction and complete denitriﬁcation to N2 were also identiﬁed as expected from the known ability of Hyphomicrobium strains to grow with DCM with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen 17

D ichloromethane DCM is one of the most used industrial halogenated solvents worldwide and its toxicity and substantial release into the environment are of serious concern 1 2 
arious methylotrophic bacterial strains capable of growing with DCM as the sole source of carbon and energy have been isolated over the years 3 
hereas natural sources of DCM exist such as production by microalgae 11 most DCM in the environment is of industrial origin raising questions about the origin evolution , and distribution of DCM dehalogenase genes in microorganisms 
yphomicrobium sp . strain GJ21 isolated after prolonged adaptation from a mixture of activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant and soil samples from polluted sites 12 has been extensively used as a model for bioremediation of DCM in bioreactor studies e.g. , see reference 13 and references therein 
matepaired library 7-kb insert size and a paired-end library 340-bp insert size were produced and sequenced using HiSeq2000 2 ⫻ 100 nucleotides yielding ~4 Gb and ~1.85 Gb of useful reads after selection and trimming , respectively 
he ﬁnal assembly resulted in 1 circular scaffold comprising 4 contigs with a cumulative size of 3.84 Mb and a G⫹C content of 60.8 % 
utomatic and manual gene annotations were performed using the MicroScope platform 14

 he isolation and characterization of a Hyphomicrobium species able to utilize DMS as a carbon and energy source and initial attempts to use this 106 strain for purification of DMS-containing air streams are presented in this study . with 0.2 M NaOH 
 he medium contained in g 1-~ : K2HPO4 0.4 KH2PO4 1.0 NH4CI 0.4 MgC12 • 6H20 0.1 CaClz • 2H20 0.01 Na2CO3 0.5 and 2 ml 1-1 trace element solution 
 ubstrates tested for growth experiments were added to a final concentration of 10 mM except for formaldehyde and sulfur compounds which were tested at I raM . Enrichment and isolation Enrichment of DMS-utilizing bacteria using activated sewage sludge as inoculum was achieved at room temperature in mineral medium containing DMS at a low concentration 0.015 mM liquid concentration during the first transfers and 0,4 mM for the following ones as the only source of carbon and energy 
 nrichment was performed in 120 ml stoppered bottles containing 20 ml medium and DMS was added by syringe after depletion of DMS new amounts were added 
 fter 6 transfers agar plates composed of the same mineral medium plus 1.5 % w/v agar were inoculated with the enrichment culture and incubated at 30 °C in ajar containing 15 mmol 1-1 DMS in the gas phase 
 ates were expressed as nmol 02 rain-I mg protein-1 and were corrected for endogenous respiration . Preparation of cell-free extracts Cell-free extracts were prepared by suspending ceils 0.5 g wet weight per ml in 50 mM Tris-HC1 buffer pH 7.0 and breaking them by passage through a French pressure cell at 110 MPa 
 he mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HC1 buffer pH 8.2 1 mol MT and about 0.15 mg of protein 
 eaction mixtures contained 25 mM glycytglycine buffer pH 7.4 0.24 mM NADH , 0.25 mM oxaloacetate and an appropriate amount of cell extract about 0.15 mg protein per ml 
 he medium was pH regulated between 6.7 and 7.0 by simultaneous addition of fresh medium and a NaOH solution 0.2 M 
 he filter was inoculated by replacing 400 ml of the recirculation fluid with a culture of Hyphomicrobium VS with an optical density at 600 nm OD600 of about 1.0 . Analytical procedures DMS and MT were determined gaschromatographically as described earlier Derikx et al . 1990 
 fter streaking on agar plates and incubation for about 14 days in a jar containing DMS and air in the gas phase small colonies were visible 
 rowth was observed between pH 6.0 and 8.0 with an optimum at pH 7.0 
 ediumconcentrationfor methanoland DMS were 20 mM and 15 raM respectively . c Methanolexhaustedculture adaptedto DMS . a n.d. = not determined . e Respirationof DMSO using batch-growncells on methanolwas foundto be zero . ing the D to 0.04 h-1 enhanced the DMS-respiration rate to 444 nmol 02 min -1 mg protein-I after one week 
 ield measurements were negatively influenced by cell attachment to the walt and inner parts of the chemostat vessel 
 he substrate affinity constants K ) for DMS and methanol as estimated from the respiration rates at different substrate concentrations were both around 3 M 
 fter addition of DMS < 0.15 raM to a methanoldepleted batch culture the capacity to respire methylated sulfides was observed after a further 4 h incubation period and a maximum respiration rate of DMS of about t50 nmol O2 rain- 1 mg protein- l was achieved after 18 h

 ethanol was added to the medium after sterilization to a final concentration of 20 raM 
 fter centrifugation at 40,000 x g at 4 °C for 20 rain the supernatant crude extract was directly used or stored at 20 oC . Enzyme assays Methanol dehydrogenase was assayed at pH 9.0 according to Duine et al . 1978 
 ethanethiol MT oxidase activity was determined gaschromatographically by measuring the disappearance of MT in the headspace of an incubation mixture total volume t.2 ml in a stoppered 100 ml bottle 
 AD+-dependent malate dehydrogenase was assayed by following the oxaloacetatedependent oxidation of NADH at 340 nm 
 very 30 min 0.5 liter of medium was sprayed on top of the packing material via a perforated plate 
 n this way the concentration of Na2SO4 never exceeded 20 mM 
 he DMS concentration in the air stream was 100 tool I -~ which in the absence of consumption would result in an equilibrium concentration of 1.5 mM in the liquid phase 
 y increasing the air flow-rate addition of DMS was gradually increased within 5 days up to 15 mmol 1- I medium 
 uring a cultivation period of 3 weeks the respiration rate for DMS was 244 nmol Oa m i n 1 mg protein- 1

 further increase was observed during the following two weeks of cultivation up to about 800 nmol 02 rain -1 mg protein -1 
 fter 4 days the concentration was increased to 4 mol 1-1 resulting in a transient increase in outlet DMS concentration 
 fter 11 days the space velocity was increased to 24 h 1 
 t day 23 the space velocity was increased further to about 100 h-1 with a concomitant decrease in the DMS concentration of the inlet to 1.4 mol 1- l 
 apid adaptation to DMS was obvious from the high removal rate from the first day on 2.3 mmoI I-1 d l 
 n increase in the inlet concentration at day 24 did not increase the outlet concentration indicating that the biofilter was not operating at maximum capacity 
 ompared to the second week during which the filter was operated at the same loading the removal capacity had clearly increased at the end of the experiment . Discussion By using low non-toxic concentrations of DMS we succeeded in the isolation of a Hyphomicrobium 110 Table 2 
 urther a biofilter inoculated with methanolgrown cells acquired the ability to remove DMS from an airstream within one day 
 hether the S-metabolic pathway of D M S will gain energy remains to be studied

 r o m short-term experiments circa 45 days it was concluded that high concentrations o f DMS 1 2 m o l 1- t were removed very efficiently at relatively high space velocities up to 100 h-1 : final outlet concentrations obtained were 0.05 tool 1-1 1 ppm 
 he pH was maintained at 7.0 by automatic titration Respiration rates of whole cells were measured polarographically in a Biological Oxygen Monitor with a Clark-type oxygen electrode at 30 °C 
 his gradual increase resulted in a more or less constant . high outlet concentration of 1.1 mol 1-1 from day 27 onwards 
 xtracts from DMS-grown cells further contained a MT oxidase activity of about 200 nmol rain-1 mg protein- 1

hole-genome sequence analyses revealed that although they share numerous orthologous genes these three species differ greatly in their nitrate reductases with gene clusters encoding a periplasmic nitrate reductase Nap in H. nitrativorans a membrane-bound nitrate reductase Nar in H. denitrificans and one Nap and two Nar enzymes in H. zavarzinii 
. nitrativorans grew and denitrified at higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations than did the two other species without significant nitrite accumulation 
ignificant increases in the relative gene expression levels of the nitrate napA and nitrite nirK reductase genes were also noted for H. nitrativorans at higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations 
mong the major differences found between their genomes was the type of nitrate reductase that they encode 
ur results showed that H. nitrativorans sustained better denitrifying activity than the other two species and had a better tolerance to higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations 
he effect of variations in the nitrate and NaCl concentrations on the relative expression levels of the nitrate and nitrite reductase genes was also assessed

o further evaluate whether the interaction between nitrate and NaCl could lead to significant differences in growth and denitrification rates in the three Hyphomicrobium species we carried out a factorial experiment using two different concentrations of each of the two factors in question 
he results showed that the three species responded differently to variations of nitrate and NaCl levels 
hile no significant interactions between the nitrate and NaCl concentrations were detected for H. nitrativorans and H. denitrificans significant interactions between these two factors were detected for the growth rate and the denitrification rate in H. zavarzinii Table 4 
ingle-factor analysis of the data subsets showed that growth and denitrification rates in H. zavarzinii were negatively affected by higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations with the lowest rates being detected at 71.4 mM NaNO3 and 0.5 % NaCl Tables 5 and 6 
n H. nitrativorans while nitrate and NaCl had no significant effect on the growth rate a significant effect of both factors on the denitrification rate was detected with higher values being observed at higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations Tables 5 and 6 
n contrast neither of the two factors had a significant effect on the denitrification rate in H. denitrificans Table 6 but the nitrate concentration had a significant effect on the growth rate with a considerably lower value at 71.4 mM NaNO3 than at 14.3 mM NaNO3 Table 5 . 5008 aem.asm.org DISCUSSION H. nitrativorans H. denitrificans and H. zavarzinii possess genes encoding the full set of enzymes required to perform complete denitrification , and they were able to achieve this process 
ur results showed the influence of nitrate and NaCl on the growth and denitrification of the three Hyphomicrobium species 
he effects of these parameters were also assessed at the nitrate and nitrite reductase gene expression levels 
e focused our analysis on these genes because the three species differ greatly in their nitrate reductases H. denitrificans also harbors a very distinct nitrite reductase while NO and N2O reductases found in the three species are more similar 
n H. nitrativorans higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations led to a small 1.4- to 3.4-fold but significant increase in the relative gene expression levels of napA and nirK Fig . 5A 
n H. zavarzinii the nitrate and NaCl concentrations affected the three nitrate reductase genes to different degrees 
imilar to narG1 the relative gene expression level of nirK in H. zavarzinii was negatively affected by higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations 
n H. nitrativorans the addition of nitrate to aerobic cultures led to small but significant increases in the relative gene expression levels of napA and nirK 1.8- and 3.2-fold respectively while incubation under denitrifying conditions led to much higher relative gene expression levels for both genes 7.1and 35.1-fold , respectively ( Fig . 5D 
n H. denitrificans the only difference observed was for the relative gene expression level of narG which was significantly higher in the presence of nitrate under aerobic conditions Fig . 5E

rom this perspective the fact that the three species differ greatly in their nitrate reductases is noteworthy and it can be hypothesized that the differences observed in their denitrification capacities reflect these variations observed at the genetic level 
uch an occurrence of multiple operons encoding nitrate reductases has previously been reported for other microorganisms 
ne well-characterized example is E. coli K-12 which also expresses two different cytoplasmic membrane nitrate reductases NRA and NRZ encoded by narGHJI and narZYWV respectively and one periplasmic nitrate reductase , encoded by napFDAGHBC 48–50 
ene deletions in E. coli K-12 indicate that Nap can support anaerobic growth when it is the only nitrate reductase available although NRA is clearly the main enzyme responsible for nitrate reduction when all enzymes are present 48 
hile Nap in E. coli is expressed under anaerobic conditions 50 and is specifically involved in nitrate reduction at low nitrate concentrations 48 51 , different functions have been proposed for the Nap system in other bacteria

ecently we described a new denitrifying species of the genus Hyphomicrobium H. nitrativorans NL23T 21 22 
his bacterium was isolated August 2015 Volume 81 Number 15 from a methanol-fed denitrification system treating seawater at the Montreal Biodome in Canada 
his could be related to the fact that Hyphomicrobium spp . can be hard to culture especially under denitrifying conditions 
oncurrently with these differences observed at the genetic level important differences in the denitrification capacities of these Hyphomicrobium species were determined 
ecause H. nitrativorans was isolated from a marine environment we focused on the effect of salt on denitrification

nder the culture conditions tested H. nitrativorans was found to be the most efficient of the three Hyphomicrobium species evaluated 
he relative gene expression level of napA did not change under any of the conditions tested 
e hypothesize that H. nitrativorans benefits from the osmoprotection of other bacteria such as M. nitratireducenticrescens JAM1 to thrive in the artificial seawater of the Biodome aquarium NaCl concentration of 2.4 % 
t is characterized by the presence of two type I Cu sites as opposed to the single type I Cu site found in the nitrite reductases of most bacteria 16 17 45 
urrently the role of this distinct nitrite reductase in the denitrifying capacity of H. denitrificans is unknown but it might be linked to the nitrite accumulation observed in H. denitrificans cultures 
he mechanisms of this enhanced tolerance to NaCl could be associated with the multisubunit Na⫹/H⫹ antiporter 
gene cluster encoding this type of antiporter was found in the H. nitrativorans genome whereas genes encoding an NhaA-type Na⫹/H⫹ antiporter were found in the genomes of the two other species 
he three species were cultured in triplicate under aerobic conditions reference cultures are represented by the dashed line set at 1 in each panel aerobic conditions with 14.3 mM NaNO3 , or denitrifying conditions with 14.3 mM NaNO3 
enitrifying conditions were shown to increase the relative gene expression level of nirK in H. nitrativorans 
o previous studies assessed quantitatively the expression of nirK under different culture conditions in Hyphomicrobium spp 
n Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.3 nirK expression is regulated by NnrR a transcriptional activator of the CRP/FNR family 60 62 
ene annotation of the H. denitrificans genome did not reveal sequences closely related to nnrR which could explain the absence of regulation of nirK expression 
reliminary assays performed in our laboratory indicated that this is not the case for H. zavarzinii but more extensive work will have to be performed to rule out this hypothesis 
or this bacterium phylogenetic analyses revealed that Nar1 is more closely related to the Nar system of Betaproteobacteria whereas Nar2 is more closely related to the Nar system found in other Gammaproteobacteria suggesting that the Nar1 system was acquired by horizontal gene transfer 23 
he expression patterns of these two genes were also slightly different with a much stronger effect of anaerobic conditions on the expression of narG1 than on the expression of narG2 
lthough the napA gene product in H. nitrativorans is more related to Nap-␣ than to Nap-␤ of Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.3 a distinct napA expression pattern was observed

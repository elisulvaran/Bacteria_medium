 he only previously established production process was based on a batch mode fermentation 780 without pH control and led to very low biomass yields about 0.8 g l−1 dry weight Klein et al . 1994 
 n the ‘ fed-batch mode ’ the pH of the culture was estimated before each feeding and adjusted to pH 7.0 by addition of few drops of Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 2007 77:779–788 2 M NaOH when necessary 
 or cultivation in the bioreactor NLF22 bioreactor Bioengineering Wald Switzerland , the cells were inoculated at an OD600 of 0.1 and initial culture volume of 7.0 l 
 he stirrer speed and the air flow were programmed in cascade with the dissolved oxygen DO in such a way that the set point of 30 % oxygen saturation was maintained by changing the air flow linearly between 0 and 11.5 l min−1 and the stirrer speed between 92 and 200 rpm 
 he samples P40 P60 and P80 were desalted using a Zeba desalt spin column Pierce Bonn Germany , and the protein concentration in the samples was determined using the micro-BCA protein assay Pierce according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions 
 o collect additional information on the detected formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity in some of the samples we also performed a redox assay in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE 8 % gels Tris/glycine buffer pH 8.3 according to Gallagher 1995 , both in the presence and in the absence of formaldehyde 
 riefly samples were clarified by centrifugation 13,000×g 4°C 10 min and the supernatants were processed , pure or diluted 2- to 25-fold in mineral medium 
 or calibration and reproducibility studies culture supernatants were replaced with standard solutions of MA-HCl at concentrations between 0.1 and 12 mM 
 he analysis was carried out on a 10 m×0.25 mm ZB-AAA fused-silica capillary column Phenomenex Aschaffenburg Germany with the following temperature program 40 to 180°C with 12°C min−1 then 180 to 320°C with 30°C min−1 , and finally 1 min at 320°C 
 he cultures were inoculated at an OD600 of 0.1 in 50 ml mineral medium containing either 0.5 % v/v MeOH or 10 25 and 50 mM MA-HCl as C1-source 
 ultures were run as batch or fed batch in the latter mode MeOH or MA-HCl Table 1 Comparison of Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 biomass obtained in the batch and fed batch mode and as a function of the C-source C1-source Batch mode g l−1 Fed-batch mode g l−1 MeOH 0.5 % v/v 10 mM MA-HCl 25 mM MA-HCl 50 mM MA-HCl 1.2 n.d. 0.4 0.6 2.2 1.4 1.5 1.2 Biomass yield cell dry weight g l−1 determined after 78 h of culture at 30°C in shake flasks

 efore each addition the pH of the culture was measured and adjusted manually to pH 7.0 with 2 M NaOH if necessary 
 fter 48 72 and 96 h the culture were supplemented with MeOH to a final concentration of 0.5 % and 10 25 or 50 mM NaCl 
 o investigate the salt tolerance of H. zavarzinii ZV 580 we cultivated the cells on MeOH 0.5 % v/v as C1source in the fed-batch mode with pH correction and added 10 25 or 50 mM NaCl to the growth medium at t=0 h and also at each feed 
 oaming was observed in several of the shake flask cultures and would have made the overnight cultivation in the bioreactor hazardous without proper counter measures . Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 2007 77:779–788 783 beyond 6 ppm started to inhibit bacterial growth reaching a 60 % reduction in biomass production for 50 ppm SigmaA compared to a parallel culture that lacked the antifoam agent 
 fter 24 32 48 and 56 h the cultures were supplemented with MA-HCl to a final concentration of 10 mM 
 efore each addition of the C1-source the pH of the culture was measured and corrected with NaOH open square or MA filled square if necessary data represent the mean values of the biomass of three independent experiments In preparation for scale-up of the cultivation by transfer to the bioreactor the effect of two antifoam agents on H. zavarzinii ZV 580 growth was studied namely the nonsilicone polyether dispersion Sigma-A204 and the silicone polymer-based antifoam agent Sigma-A 
 ncreasing the concentration of Sigma-A To scale up the process the optimized fed-batch protocol developed for the shake flask was transferred to the bioreactor starting volume 7 l keeping all other experimental parameters as similar as possible although the quantity of MA-HCl added to the culture after 72 80 and 96 h of growth was somewhat increased see figure legends for details 
 fter 24 32 48 56 72 80 and 96 h the culture were manually supplemented with MA-HCl to a final concentration of 25.5 mM inverted open triangle , 38.6 mM open triangle , 55.7 mM filled triangle or 64.3 mM arrow down 
 he feed-pump flow rate 30.4 ml min−1 was set empirically to automatically run for 0.3 min between t0 and t40 and for 0.6 min between t40 and t55 whenever DO≥35 % 
 ata for biomass development and C1-source concentration are presented in Fig . 5 
 t can be seen that during the exponential phase the MA-HCl is quickly consumed and the biomass yield corresponds to 0.029 g dry weight per mmol of MAHCl 
 rowth stopped plateau after 75 h of culture although the vitality of the bacteria was nearly 100 % in colony forming assay data not shown and nutrients were still available 
 fter 56 and 78 h of culture the DO increased slightly but did not surpass 35 % anymore . Each time the culture was manually supplemented with 38 and 38.7 mM MA-HCl 
 he biomass production is displayed by black squares the MA-HCl concentration in the fermentation broth by white circles the dissolved oxygen tension by solid line and the feed by dashed line 
 ased on the biomass data the following specific growth rates were calculated from the slope of a plot ln N cell concentration against time t 8 to 28 h μmax =0.101 h−1 28 to 48 h μmax =0.07 h−1 48 to 100 h μmax =0.009 h−1 Effect of culture condition on dlFalDH yield To determine the product titers during the production of dlFalDH by H. zavarzinii ZV 580 the redox cycling microassay was used to analyze the cell free extract CFE and fractions P40 P60 and P80 obtained by NH4 2SO4 precipitation 
 he data presented above strongly suggest that fraction P60 contains the dlFalDH . ‘ Volumetric ’ productivity is an important index for evaluating the efficiency of a bioprocess and can be defined as product produced per unit biomass 
 he effect of the culture conditions on the dlFalDH production was analyzed by determining the dlFalDH activity in the reconstituted P60 fraction at the end of the fermentation by the redox cycling microassay and the quantity of enzymatic units present per gram biomass was calculated 
 he initial C1-source concentration in the medium and the concentration and time course of the feeding also influence the overall productivity of the cells 
 uch a weak biomass production might be due not only to growth limitation because of nutrient limitation and/or acidification of the fermentation medium by by-products released during the culture but also to the Table 4 Comparison of dlFalDH production as a function of the cultivation conditions Culture mode and C-source feeding strategy Shake flask Bioreactor Batch t0 25 mM Fed-batch 1 t0 10 mM Feed t71 93 115 123 139 163 25 mM Fed-batch 2 t0 20 mM Feed t55 72 30 mM t79 40 mM Fed-batch 3 t0 10 mM Feed t24,48 25 mM t32,56 38.5 mM t72 55.7 mM t80,96 64.3 mM Fed-batch 4 t0 10 mM Feed t31 11.3 mM t54 34 mM t66 30 mM t79 29.6 mM t90 29.1 mM Fed-batch 5 t0 10 mM Feed automatic 0.11 U g−1 n.d. 0.13 U g−1 n.d. 0.19 U g−1 n.d. n.d. 0.30 U g−1 n.d. 0.36 U g−1 n.d. 0.31 U g−1 dlFalDH yield at the end of the culture expressed in unit g−1 biomass wet weight 
 ne aspect may be an increase in the salt concentration after several rounds of MA-HCl feeding and pH correction with NaOH 
 n this context the specific growth rates of the early and late phases were not influenced either by the culture vessel shake flask vs bioreactor or by the process parameters manual vs automatic feeding and pH control 
 n particular the process uses an automated feeding strategy controlled via the dissolved oxygen concentration 
 n addition our results show that the growth of H. zavarzinii ZV 580 is rather sensitive toward increasing salt concentration in the culture medium 
 djustment of the pH via the addition of methylamine instead of NaOH on the other hand leads to an increase in biomass yield 
 he pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 before autoclaving 
 acterial growth was monitored by measuring the optical density of the culture at 600 nm OD600 
 ptical densities were related to the dry weight via a calibration curve prepared using cells obtained by centrifugation 11,700×g 10 min 4°C from fully grown cultures at the end of the exponential phase 
 hile 100 % airflow was adjusted for 100 % output signal the maximum stirrer speed was already adjusted for 50 % output signal 
 he assay was performed in flat-bottom microtiter plates Greiner Bio-one GmbH Frickenhausen Germany using 200 μl reaction mixture optical path length 5.9 mm detection wavelength 595 nm with the temperature maintained at 30°C in a Genios Pro plate reader Tecan Crailsheim Germany 
 ne unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required for reduction of 1 μmol of DCPIP per minute 
 he calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.1 to 8 mM RSD≤5 % 
 n the batch mode cells stopped growing after 28 h 25 mM MAHCl or after 45 h 0.5 % v/v MeOH 50 mM MA-HCl 
 rom the results compiled in Table 1 it becomes evident that by running the culture in the fed-batch mode with pH adjustment the biomass yield can be increased two- to threefold 
 ased on the biomass data the following specific growth rates were calculated from the slope of a plot ln N cell concentration against time t 10 to 32 h μmax =0.12 h−1 32 to 56 h μmax =0.04 h−1 56 to 100 h μmax = 0.009 h−1 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 2007 77:779–788 Fig . 2 Inhibition of cellular growth of Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 by increasing amounts of NaCl 
 f necessary the pH of the culture was adjusted to 7 using 2 M NaOH Several media components may also exert an inhibitory influence on biomass production 
 he cells were fed three times leading to final NaCl concentrations in the growth medium ranging from 40 to 250 mM at the end of the culture t=102 h 
 s displayed in Fig . 2 the upper limit tolerated by the cells under these conditions seems to be 50 mM NaCl 
 s a possible means to reduce the salt accumulation in the fermentation broth during the fed-batch culture methylamine MA instead of NaOH was used for pH correction 
 wo types of shake flasks cultures were done in parallel correcting the pH either with NaOH or with MA 
 n both cases the cultures were supplemented four times with MA-HCl as C-source 0.5 mmol per feed , Fig . 3 
 ven considering the standard deviation of the individual measurement points n=3 , pH adjustment with MA led to a significant increase in biomass at the end of the culture compared to a culture where NaOH was used 
 ed-batch cultivation of H. zavarzinii ZV 580 in the bioreactor Fig . 3 Influence of the means of pH control NaOH or methylamine on the growth of Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 
 ccording to these results as little as 0.5 % v/v of Sigma-A204 in the growth medium already caused a 47 % decrease in the final biomass while the addition of Sigma-A at concentrations of up to 6 ppm had no significant effect on H. zavarzinii ZV 580 growth 
 fterwards the two curves slightly diverged from each other with the bioreactor yielding less biomass than the shake flask although the specific growth rates were almost identical in the late phase Fig . 4 .

 he pH of the culture was maintained constant at pH 7 by automatic titration with 2 M NaOH 
 ased on the biomass data the following specific growth rates were calculated from the slope of a plot ln N cell concentration against time t 10 to 32 h μmax =0.11 h−1 32 to 56 h μmax =0.03 h−1 56 to 100 h μmax =0.008 h−1 784 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 2007 77:779–788 To improve the feeding schedule additional experiments including the assessment of the MA-HCl concentration in the medium were performed 
 or this purpose the substrate MA-HCl concentration was analyzed by gas chromatography 
 fter a few bioreactor runs it became obvious that the dissolved O2 DO briefly jumped above 35 % air saturation when the H. zavarzinii ZV 580 cells stopped growing 
 s we assumed that the growth arrest reflects a C1-source limitation we took advantage of this phenomenon to develop an ‘ on-demand ’ feeding for the culture in the bioreactor activating the feeding-pump whenever the pO2 values were above 35 % air saturation 
 fter 45 h of fermentation we activated the feed pump twice manually for 1 min because the DO values consistently stayed below 35 % see legend to Fig . 5 for details 
 fter 55 h of culture the cell growth slowed down although the C1-source was not depleted from the medium the methylamine concentration was still above 20 mM 
 he culture was run in the fed-batch mode the feed 5 M MA-HCl pump flow rate 30.4 ml min−1 was activated for 0.3 to 1 min whenever the dissolved oxygen value surpassed 35 % 
 he previously published protocol bioreactor without pH control for growth on MA-HCl as C-source yielded approximately 0.8 g l−1 dry weight at the end of the exponential phase Klein et al . 1994 , which can be considered typical 
 hile some salt accumulation in the fermentation broth is unavoidable in a fed-batch culture we nevertheless found that using methylamine MA instead of NaOH for pH correction had a beneficial effect on biomass production 
 his approach has the advantage that MA can also be used as C1-source by the H. zavarzinii ZV 580 thereby lowering the amount of MA-HCl to be added during feeding concomitant to the pH control 
 second prerequisite for transfer of the dlFalDH production to the bioreactor is the addition of a suitable antifoam agent 
 s shown in Table 2 between the two agents tested the cells were very sensitive to agent SigmaA204 where the addition of 0.5 % v/v to the growth medium caused a 47 % decrease in the final biomass yield 
 uch a concentration of the antifoam agent would on the other hand most likely not even be sufficient to prevent foaming in the bioreactor especially towards the end of the cultivation 
 ndependently of the applied feeding strategy the growth of H. zavarzinii ZV 580 seemed to correlate with the methylamine concentration in the culture medium 
 nterestingly the highest specific growth rate 0.12 h−1 was achieved at low methylamine concentration 
 owever as an increasing salt concentration in the fermentation medium also inhibits cellular growth an increasing osmomolarity of the medium caused by increased methylamine concentration may also negatively influence the growth rate 
 his assumption is also supported by the fact that pH correction with methylamine led to a significant increase of the biomass yield

 t is possible that in general too high a concentration of nutrients results in growth inhibition for this oligotrophic strain which in nature is used to live at low nutrient levels Hirsch 1986

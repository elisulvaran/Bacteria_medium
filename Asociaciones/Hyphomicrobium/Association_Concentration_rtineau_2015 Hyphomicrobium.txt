 ingle-factor analysis of the data subsets showed that growth and denitrification rates in H. zavarzinii were negatively affected by higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations, with the lowest rates being detected at 71.4 mM NaNO3 and 0.5% NaCl (Tables 5 and 6) 
 n contrast, neither of the two factors had a significant effect on the denitrification rate in H. denitrificans (Table 6), but the nitrate concentration had a significant effect on the growth rate, with a considerably lower value at 71.4 mM NaNO3 than at 14.3 mM NaNO3 (Table 5).  5008  aem.asm.org  DISCUSSION  H. nitrativorans, H. denitrificans, and H. zavarzinii possess genes encoding the full set of enzymes required to perform complete denitrification, and they were able to achieve this process

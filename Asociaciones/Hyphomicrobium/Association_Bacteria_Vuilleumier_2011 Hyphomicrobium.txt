ts genome, consisting of a single 4.76-Mb chromosome, is the first for a chloromethane-degrading bacterium to be formally reported. predicted open reading frames (ORFs), 947 (20%) have close homologs (⬎80% amino acid identity over ⬎80% of protein length, almost all of them in synteny) in Hyphomicrobium denitrificans ATCC 51888, whose genome sequence has been determined (NC_014313) (4) 
he Hyphomicrobium sp. strain MC1 genome sequence was deposited in GenBank/EMBL under accession number FQ859181.  Strains of the genus Hyphomicrobium originally attracted interest for their distinctive prosthecae and atypical complex growth cycle (9) 
ollowing the description of strain MC1 (6), several chloromethane-degrading Hyphomicrobium strains were isolated from various aquatic and soil environments, and most recently also from the surfaces of plant leaves (11) 
he assembled genome sequence of Hyphomicrobium sp. strain MC1 was obtained using a mix of sequencing technologies 
ased on the 16S rRNA sequence of its single rRNA operon, strain MC1 appears to be most closely related to Hyphomicrobium facile subspecies type strains

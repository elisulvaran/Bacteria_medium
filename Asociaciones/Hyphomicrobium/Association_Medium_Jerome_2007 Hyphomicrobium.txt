he concentration of the ammonium sulfate in the supernatant was increased to 60% saturation, and after a further incubation for 60 min at 4°C, the precipitated fraction (‘60% fraction’ or ‘P60’) was collected by centrifugation as above and resuspended in a minimum volume of P buffer

n this contribution, a fed-batch bioprocess is developed, which improves both the biomass production of H. zavarzinii ZV 580 (from 0.6 to 2 g l−1 dry mass) and the specific dlFalDH production (from 0.1 to 0.3 units g−1 biomass), resulting in an overall improvement of the productivity by more than an order of magnitude compared to the previously reported process (Klein et al., Biochem J 301:289–295, 1994) 
reitag (*) Chair for Process Biotechnology, University of Bayreuth, 95440 Bayreuth, Germany e-mail: bioprozesstechnik@uni-bayreuth.de  Introduction The Gram-negative bacterial strain Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 has first been described in 1955 (Zavarzin 1955) and elicited moderate interest since then (e.g., Matzen and Hirsch 1982; Moore and Duxbury 1981; Zavarzin 1960) 
. zavarzinii ZV 580 is a ‘slow growing’ methylotrophic bacterium, (Hirsch and Conti 1964b) most noted for the facultative expression of a formaldehydeoxidizing enzyme when grown on certain C1-sources 
he molecular nature of this cofactor has not yet been elucidated but bears features of a protein-bound quinone (Klein et al. 1994), hence the name ‘dye-linked formaldehyde dehydrogenase’ (dlFalDH) given to this particular enzyme. dlFalDH produced by H. zavarzinii ZV 580 when grown, e.g., on methylamine hydrochloride, differs from other dyelinked aldehyde dehydrogenases of methylotrophic bacteria by its affinity and specificity towards formaldehyde 
owever, to create a viable production process, the biomass and the specific dlFalDH yield of the organism have to be maximized 
o date, little effort has been made to optimize the cultivation parameters for H. zavarzinii ZV 580 (Matzen and Hirsch 1982) 
he only previously established production process was based on a batch mode fermentation  780  without pH control and led to very low biomass yields (about 0.8 g l−1 dry weight, Klein et al. 1994) 
he situation is made worse by the fact that the cell structure of Hyphomicrobium and its method of reproduction are fairly complex (Zavarzin 1961) 
n particular, the life cycle of Hyphomicrobium sp. exhibits three different morphological states (swarmer, hyphal, and rosette) reflecting two processes, the formation of mother cells and the formation of daughter cells, occurring at the same time (Moore and Hirsch 1973a,b, Conti and Hirsch 1965; Zavarzin 1960, Poindexter 1964) 
n this study, an improved fermentation process for H. zavarzinii ZV 580 was developed, which is characterized by a more than threefold increase in both biomass and specific enzyme production.  Materials and methods Materials Chemicals including minerals for the media were from established suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich and used as obtained 
or this purpose, the bacteria were twice washed and re-centrifuged, then dried in pre-weighted glass tubes at 80°C to constant weight 
ultures were inoculated at an OD600 of 0.1 and incubated at 30°C and 135 rpm on a rotary shaker (Thermo Life Sciences, Egelsbach, Germany) 
n the ‘fed-batch mode’, the pH of the culture was estimated before each feeding and adjusted to pH 7.0 by addition of few drops of  Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2007) 77:779–788  2 M NaOH when necessary 
or cultivation in the bioreactor (NLF22 bioreactor, Bioengineering, Wald, Switzerland), the cells were inoculated at an OD600 of 0.1 and initial culture volume of 7.0 l 
he stirrer speed and the air flow were programmed in cascade with the dissolved oxygen (DO) in such a way that the set point of 30% oxygen saturation was maintained by changing the air flow linearly between 0 and 11.5 l min−1 and the stirrer speed between 92 and 200 rpm 
reparation of the cell-free extracts For the preparation of cell-free extracts, the fresh or frozen cells were resuspended in 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg ml−1 lysozyme, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulphonyl fluoride, 2.5 units ml−1 DNase, and 3 mM MgCl2, followed by sonication (five times for 1 min) on ice 
he samples (P40, P60, and P80) were desalted using a Zeba desalt spin column (Pierce, Bonn, Germany), and the protein concentration in the samples was determined using the micro-BCA protein assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
his test relies on a redox reaction converting the substrate (formaldehyde) into formate, thereby releasing two electrons, which are transferred first to the dlFalDH cofactor (unidentified quinone), then to the mediator PMS (phenazine methosulfate), and finally to the  Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2007) 77:779–788  781  dye DCPIP (dichlorophenolindophenol) that becomes colorless upon reduction, leading to a decrease of the OD595 
he activity was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 21,000 M−1 cm−1 (Steyn-Parvé and Beinert 1958) 
o collect additional information on the detected formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity in some of the samples, we also performed a redox assay in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE; 8% gels, Tris/glycine buffer pH 8.3 according to Gallagher 1995), both in the presence and in the absence of formaldehyde 
erforming the assay in the presence and the absence of formaldehyde allows distinguishing between enzymes that reduce the redox coloring agent as follow-up to a specific formaldehyde oxidation and those that do not require the presence of formaldehyde for this reaction, i.e., most likely are not true formaldehyde dehydrogenases 
BT and PMS stock solution were prepared in P buffer 
riefly, samples were clarified by centrifugation (13,000×g, 4°C, 10 min), and the supernatants were processed, pure or diluted 2- to 25-fold in mineral medium 
or calibration and reproducibility studies, culture supernatants were replaced with standard solutions of MA-HCl at concentrations between 0.1 and 12 mM 
he analysis was carried out on a 10 m×0.25 mm ZB-AAA fused-silica capillary column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany), with the following temperature program: 40 to 180°C with 12°C min−1, then 180 to 320°C with 30°C min−1, and finally 1 min at 320°C 
he cultures were inoculated at an OD600 of 0.1 in 50 ml mineral medium containing either 0.5% (v/v) MeOH or 10, 25, and 50 mM MA-HCl as C1-source 
ultures were run as batch or fed batch, in the latter mode, MeOH or MA-HCl  Table 1 Comparison of Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 biomass obtained in the batch and fed batch mode and as a function of the C-source C1-source  Batch mode (g l−1)  Fed-batch mode (g l−1)  MeOH (0.5% v/v) 10 mM MA-HCl 25 mM MA-HCl 50 mM MA-HCl  1.2 n.d. 0.4 0.6  2.2 1.4 1.5 1.2  Biomass yield (cell dry weight, g l−1 ) determined after 78 h of culture at 30°C in shake flasks

rowth rates and biomass production were monitored, Table 1 
owever, the specific growth rate could not be kept constant over the 100 h of cultivation, dropping from a μmax of 0.12 between 10 to 32 h to a μmax of 0.04 between 32 and 56 h, and finally a μmax of 0.009 between 56 and 100 h 
ubsequently, we will refer to these three growth phases as early, middle, and late phase.  Fig. 1 Culture of Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 in shake flask 
fter 24, 32, 48, 56, 72, 80, and 96 h, the culture was manually supplemented with MA-HCl to a final concentration of 25.5 mM (triangle) or 38.6 mM (inverted triangle) 
efore each addition, the pH of the culture was measured and adjusted manually to pH 7.0 with 2 M NaOH, if necessary 
fter 48, 72, and 96 h, the culture were supplemented with MeOH to a final concentration of 0.5% and 10, 25, or 50 mM NaCl 
ariations observed when repeating these and other shaker flask cultivations of H. zavarzinii ZV 580 run in the fed-batch mode suggested that high salt concentrations might inhibit cell growth (data not shown) 
o investigate the salt tolerance of H. zavarzinii ZV 580, we cultivated the cells on MeOH (0.5% v/v) as C1source in the fed-batch mode with pH correction and added 10, 25, or 50 mM NaCl to the growth medium at t=0 h and also at each feed 
or results and details, see Fig. 2 
oaming was observed in several of the shake flask cultures and would have made the overnight cultivation in the bioreactor hazardous without proper counter measures.  Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2007) 77:779–788  783  beyond 6 ppm started to inhibit bacterial growth, reaching a 60% reduction in biomass production for 50 ppm SigmaA compared to a parallel culture that lacked the antifoam agent 
fter 24, 32, 48, and 56 h, the cultures were supplemented with MA-HCl to a final concentration of 10 mM 
efore each addition of the C1-source, the pH of the culture was measured and corrected with NaOH (open square) or MA (filled square) if necessary (data represent the mean values of the biomass of three independent experiments)  In preparation for scale-up of the cultivation by transfer to the bioreactor, the effect of two antifoam agents on H. zavarzinii ZV 580 growth was studied, namely, the nonsilicone polyether dispersion Sigma-A204 and the silicone polymer-based antifoam agent Sigma-A 
he former was added to the culture from the start, and the latter was added when the cells reached the mid-exponential phase 
ncreasing the concentration of Sigma-A  To scale up the process, the optimized fed-batch protocol developed for the shake flask was transferred to the bioreactor (starting volume 7 l) keeping all other experimental parameters as similar as possible, although the quantity of MA-HCl added to the culture after 72, 80, and 96 h of growth was somewhat increased (see figure legends for details) 
he bioreactor results are compiled in Fig. 4 and should be compared directly with those shown in Fig. 1 (corresponding shake flask culture) 
he three growth phases previously observed (Fig. 1) were also observed in the bioreactor (μmax of 0.11 between 10 to 32 h; μmax of 0.03 between 32 and 56 h; μmax of 0.008 between 56 and 100 h) 
fter 24, 32, 48, 56, 72, 80, and 96 h, the culture were manually supplemented with MA-HCl to a final concentration of 25.5 mM (inverted open triangle), 38.6 mM (open triangle), 55.7 mM (filled triangle) or 64.3 mM (arrow down) 
he feed-pump (flow rate, 30.4 ml min−1) was set empirically to automatically run for 0.3 min (between t0 and t40) and for 0.6 min (between t40 and t55) whenever DO≥35% 
ata for biomass development and C1-source concentration are presented in Fig. 5 
t can be seen that during the exponential phase the MA-HCl is quickly consumed, and the biomass yield corresponds to 0.029 g (dry weight) per mmol of MAHCl 
rowth stopped (plateau) after 75 h of culture, although the vitality of the bacteria was nearly 100% in colony forming assay (data not shown) and nutrients were still available 
fter 56 and 78 h of culture, the DO increased slightly but did not surpass 35% anymore.  Each time, the culture was manually supplemented with 38 and 38.7 mM MA-HCl 
he biomass production is displayed by black squares, the MA-HCl concentration in the fermentation broth by white circles, the dissolved oxygen tension by solid line, and the feed by dashed line 
hile the activity in case of P80 was similar in the presence and the absence of PMS, in P60, the activity was significantly increased in the presence of PMS 
hen the redox assay was performed in the native PAGE gels of the corresponding samples, we were not able to see any differences in the band patterns obtained for P60 and P80 in the presence and absence of formaldehyde (data not shown) 
t has been suggested (Schwartz AC, personal communication) that Ca2+ ions are required for the stabilization of the tetrameric structure of the dlFalDH from H. zavarzinii ZV 580 and for its optimal functionality 
he results are included in Table 3, and the corresponding gels are shown in Fig. 6 
ave for P40, two bands are seen in the high molecular weight range of both gels, i.e., in the absence and the presence of the substrate formaldehyde for all fractions and the CFE 
his phenomenon is described in the literature as ‘nothing dehydrogenase’ (Rothe 1994) and is of no further concern 
n addition, save for P40, one band is seen only in the presence of the substrate formaldehyde for all fractions and the CFE, indicated by a star in Fig. 6 
ll ‘formaldehyde-depending’ bands were subsequently cut out from the native gel and analyzed by SDS-PAGE 
ubsequently, the redox cycling microassay (microtitre plate redox assay) was repeated for the reconstituted fractions P60 and P80, Table 3 
he data presented above strongly suggest that fraction P60 contains the dlFalDH. ‘Volumetric’ productivity is an important index for evaluating the efficiency of a bioprocess and can be defined as product produced per unit biomass 
he effect of the culture conditions on the dlFalDH production was analyzed by determining the dlFalDH activity in the reconstituted P60 fraction at the end of the fermentation by the redox cycling microassay, and the quantity of enzymatic units present per gram biomass was calculated 
he initial C1-source concentration in the medium and the concentration and time course of the feeding also influence the overall productivity of the cells 
ost importantly, when the productivity was determined as a function of the fermentation time, in particular after 29, 53, 77, and 97 h of fermentation in the bioreactor (Fig. 5), values obtained after 29 and 53 h (0.27 U g−1 for both time points) were in the same order of magnitude as before (Table 4), while somewhat lower values were determined after 77 and 97 h (0.18 and 0.16 U g−1, respectively).  Discussion H. zavarzinii ZV580 is known to grow on various C1sources including methanol (MeOH) and methylamine hydrochloride (MA-HCl), albeit typically only to rather low cell densities 
uch a weak biomass production might be due not only to growth limitation because of nutrient limitation and/or acidification of the fermentation medium by by-products released during the culture, but also to the  Table 4 Comparison of dlFalDH production as a function of the cultivation conditions Culture mode and C-source feeding strategy  Shake flask  Bioreactor  Batch t0: 25 mM Fed-batch 1 t0: 10 mM Feed: t71, 93, 115, 123, 139, 163: 25 mM Fed-batch 2 t0: 20 mM Feed: t55, 72: 30 mM; t79: 40 mM Fed-batch 3 t0: 10 mM Feed: t24,48, 25 mM; t32,56, 38.5 mM; t72, 55.7 mM; t80,96, 64.3 mM Fed-batch 4 t0: 10 mM Feed: t31, 11.3 mM; t54, 34 mM; t66, 30 mM; t79, 29.6 mM; t90, 29.1 mM Fed-batch 5 t0: 10 mM Feed: automatic  0.11 U g−1  n.d.  0.13 U g−1  n.d.  0.19 U g−1  n.d.  n.d.  0.30 U g−1  n.d.  0.36 U g−1  n.d.  0.31 U g−1  dlFalDH yield at the end of the culture expressed in unit g−1 biomass (wet weight)

he enzyme is exclusively produced when the bacteria are grown on methylamine hydrochloride (or methylamine), as previously described by Kohler and Schwartz (1982) 
n this contribution, it is shown that, via a suitable fed batch strategy, it is possible to improve the biomass yield of up to 3.5-fold and the specific enzyme production from 0.11 to 0.30 units g−1 biomass 
ndependently of the applied feeding strategy, the growth of H. zavarzinii ZV 580 can be divided in three growth phases (early, middle, and late) 
he specific growth rate is highest in the early and lowest in the late phase 
ne aspect may be an increase in the salt concentration after several rounds of MA-HCl feeding and pH correction with NaOH 
ntifoam Sigma-A204 is a surfactant and might disrupt or interfere with this interaction leading to a blockage of the cell cycle and, consequently, to proliferation inhibition 
 previous study had shown that Tween 80 prevents rosettes formation (Moore and Marshall 1981) 
t is also possible that the fermentation parameters and/or feeding strategy were somehow less successful in the bioreactor than in the shake flask or that the controlled environment in the bioreactor led to an improved C1-source uptake/metabolism and thus to an earlier starvation of the bacteria inducing a lag phase (observable as slight reduction in biomass in the bioreactor after 55 h of cultivation, Fig. 4) 
n this context, the specific growth rates of the early and late phases were not influenced either by the culture vessel (shake flask vs bioreactor) or by the process parameters (manual vs automatic feeding and pH control) 
yphal bacteria are normally present in culture as heterogeneous population of cells (swarmer, hyphal/budding stages, and rosette-like aggregates); each population might have a different sensitivity to the physico-chemical parameters of the fermentation medium 
owever, as this genus utilizes C1 carbon compounds as the sole source of carbon and energy, it is questionable if this consumption varied according to the life cycle stages (Hirsch and Conti 1964a,b; Moore 1981) 
ata analyzing the kinetics of dlFalDH expression during the fermentation (Fig. 5) suggest again a correlation between the cell growth, the methylamine consumption rate, and the quantity of enzyme produced 
 supplementary set of analysis of the enzyme production at the RNA level with for example RT-PCR or quantitative RT-PCR should clarify this point and allow us to further improve the enzyme production 
ased on the results achieved, we conclude that there are two major factors that seem to positively affect dlFalDH productivity: culture in the fed-batch mode in the bioreactor and active methylamine consumption

he enzyme thus has considerable potential for technical applications if the difficulties associated with its efficient production can be resolved 
n particular, the process uses an automated feeding strategy controlled via the dissolved oxygen concentration 
n addition, our results show that the growth of H. zavarzinii ZV 580 is rather sensitive toward increasing salt concentration in the culture medium 
rowth is also inhibited by the presence of surfactant-based antifoam reagents 
djustment of the pH via the addition of methylamine instead of NaOH, on the other hand, leads to an increase in biomass yield 
his enzyme belongs to the family of NAD(P)-independent aldehyde dehydrogenases 
his, together with the absence of NAD(P) as electron acceptor in the catalytic reaction, makes dlFalDH particular suitable for several technical applications, for example, in the biosensor field, if enough material can be produced in a cost efficient manner 
xpression of the enzyme in recombinant form is not straightforward due to the necessity of the cofactor 
ells in the different stages of development may differ in their needs, rendering process development difficult 
illipore water was used for the preparation of all aqueous solutions 
he strain H. zavarzinii ZV 580 was from the collection of the “Institute für Allgemeine Mikrobiologie” (University of Kiel, Germany, accession number IFAM ZV-580, EMBL accession number Y14306) 
he pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0 before autoclaving 
acterial growth was monitored by measuring the optical density of the culture at 600 nm (OD600) 
ptical densities were related to the dry weight via a calibration curve prepared using cells obtained by centrifugation (11,700×g, 10 min, 4°C) from fully grown cultures at the end of the exponential phase 
hile 100% airflow was adjusted for 100% output signal, the maximum stirrer speed was already adjusted for 50% output signal 
nalytical methods To determine the product titers during the production of dlFalDH by H. zavarzinii ZV 580, the spectrophotometric enzyme assay for formaldehyde dehydrogenase previously published by Borodina et al. (2000) was scaled down to the microtiter plate format (‘redox cycling microassay’) 
he assay was performed in flat-bottom microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-one GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) using 200 μl reaction mixture (optical path length, 5.9 mm; detection wavelength, 595 nm) with the temperature maintained at 30°C in a Genios Pro plate reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) 
ne unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required for reduction of 1 μmol of DCPIP per minute 
his procedure has the advantage that the enzymes giving positive results are first separated in the gel 
n particular, the formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FalDH) activity in the gel was detected according to a protocol modified from Paz et al. (1991), employing nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) as the redox coloring agent 
he calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.1 to 8 mM (RSD≤5%) 
elium was the carrier gas (head pressure, 0.45 bar) 
.01.03 was applied for computer-assisted data processing.  Results The aim of the bioprocess strategy described in this publication was to improve the biomass production of H. zavarzinii ZV 580 cultured in the bioreactor and, in consequence, the overall dlFalDH enzyme production 
ffect of media composition To identify possible factors affecting the biomass production, series of shake flask cultures were performed 
n the batch mode, cells stopped growing after 28 h (25 mM MAHCl) or after 45 h [0.5% (v/v) MeOH; 50 mM MA-HCl] 
ssuming that the C1-source has been completely metabolized, a substrate consumption rate of 2.3 mmol g−1 h−1 can be calculated for MeOH, while this rate is in the range of 2.0–2.4 mmol g−1 h−1 for MA-HCl 
rom the results compiled in Table 1, it becomes evident that, by running the culture in the fed-batch mode with pH adjustment, the biomass yield can be increased two- to threefold 
 substrate limitation thus seems to be among the reasons for the previously observed low final biomass yields 
his was corroborated by the fact that a feeding strategy designed to further extend the growth phase (Fig. 1, see figure legend for details) further improved the overall biomass production up to a final value of 2.3 g l−1 
oncomitantly, the culture could be extended to 100 h 
ased on the biomass data, the following specific growth rates were calculated from the slope of a plot ln N (cell concentration) against time t: 10 to 32 h, μmax =0.12 h−1; 32 to 56 h, μmax =0.04 h−1; 56 to 100 h, μmax = 0.009 h−1  Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2007) 77:779–788  Fig. 2 Inhibition of cellular growth of Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 by increasing amounts of NaCl 
f necessary, the pH of the culture was adjusted to 7 using 2 M NaOH  Several media components may also exert an inhibitory influence on biomass production 
he cells were fed three times leading to final NaCl concentrations in the growth medium ranging from 40 to 250 mM at the end of the culture (t=102 h) 
s displayed in Fig. 2, the upper limit tolerated by the cells under these conditions seems to be 50 mM NaCl 
s a possible means to reduce the salt accumulation in the fermentation broth during the fed-batch culture, methylamine (MA) instead of NaOH was used for pH correction 
wo types of shake flasks cultures were done in parallel correcting the pH either with NaOH or with MA 
n both cases, the cultures were supplemented four times with MA-HCl as C-source (0.5 mmol per feed), Fig. 3 
ven considering the standard deviation of the individual measurement points (n=3), pH adjustment with MA led to a significant increase in biomass at the end of the culture compared to a culture where NaOH was used 
ed-batch cultivation of H. zavarzinii ZV 580 in the bioreactor  Fig. 3 Influence of the means of pH control (NaOH or methylamine) on the growth of Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 
ccording to these results, as little as 0.5% (v/v) of Sigma-A204 in the growth medium already caused a 47% decrease in the final biomass, while the addition of Sigma-A at concentrations of up to 6 ppm had no significant effect on H. zavarzinii ZV 580 growth 
oreover, cell growth was identical in both culture vessels over the first 55 h of culture 
fterwards, the two curves slightly diverged from each other, with the bioreactor yielding less biomass than the shake flask, although the specific growth rates were almost identical in the late phase (Fig. 4).

he pH of the culture was maintained constant at pH 7 by automatic titration with 2 M NaOH 
ased on the biomass data, the following specific growth rates were calculated from the slope of a plot ln N (cell concentration) against time t: 10 to 32 h: μmax =0.11 h−1, 32 to 56 h: μmax =0.03 h−1, 56 to 100 h: μmax =0.008 h−1  784  Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2007) 77:779–788  To improve the feeding schedule, additional experiments including the assessment of the MA-HCl concentration in the medium were performed 
or this purpose, the substrate (MA-HCl) concentration was analyzed by gas chromatography 
n parallel, we attempted to automate the feeding process 
fter a few bioreactor runs, it became obvious that the dissolved O2 (DO) briefly jumped above 35% air saturation when the H. zavarzinii ZV 580 cells stopped growing 
s we assumed that the growth arrest reflects a C1-source limitation, we took advantage of this phenomenon to develop an ‘on-demand’ feeding for the culture in the bioreactor, activating the feeding-pump whenever the pO2 values were above 35% air saturation 
fter 45 h of fermentation, we activated the feed pump twice manually for 1 min because the DO values consistently stayed below 35% (see legend to Fig. 5 for details) 
fter 55 h of culture, the cell growth slowed down, although the C1-source was not depleted from the medium;  the methylamine concentration was still above 20 mM 
nder this feeding strategy, the biomass yield was 1.5 g l−1 demonstrating the potential of such a feeding strategy for the fermentation of H. zavarzinii ZV 580, although the fully automated ‘on demand’ feeding could only be achieved for the first 45 h of culture 
ost importantly, this approach allowed us to increase the specific growth rate in the middle phase more than twofold.  Fig. 5 Cultivation of Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 in the bioreactor with automatic feeding based on the dissolved oxygen 
he culture was run in the fed-batch mode, the feed (5 M MA-HCl) pump (flow rate, 30.4 ml min−1) was activated for 0.3 to 1 min whenever the dissolved oxygen value surpassed 35% 
he results compiled in Table 3 show that the enzyme activity in the CFE is relatively weak 
ore importantly, we obtained positive results even in the absence of the mediator PMS in the assay mixture 
FE Cell-free extract  the CFE 
oreover, as the nature of the cofactor is not known, it cannot be excluded that the cofactor was removed from the protein during precipitation/sample processing 
t has been speculated that PQQ might be the bound cofactor in the dlFalDH from H. zavarzinii ZV 580 
his is the case as for the membraneassociated quinoprotein formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Methylococcus capsulatus bath (Zahn et al. 2001) 
n addition, some lighter bands are observed in the gel 
he reason for the occurrence of such bands is at present still unclear; however, they do not present formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity 
wo additional bands (marked by arrows in Fig. 6) appear exclusively for fraction P60 in the presence of the substrate formaldehyde 
ark bands represent the formazan precipitate, which reflects the desired enzymatic activity  786  exclusively in fraction P60 (indicated by arrows in Fig. 6) contain proteins or protein subunits with a molecular weight in the range of 45 to 55 kDa, which correlates with the expected size of the dlFalDH monomer (Klein et al. 1994) 
he lower band seen in all fractions save P40 (indicated by a star in Fig. 6) contains proteins with a molecular weight in the range of 10 to 14 kDa 
his result incidentally also demonstrates that the redox cycling assay when performed on non- or only partially purified cell extracts can only give an estimation of the formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity 
f all fractions, only P60 showed an increase in activity measured after reconstitution compared to the activity determined without reconstitution 
s shown in Table 4, even in the shake flasks, the fed-batch mode, in particular in the case of ‘fed-batch 2’, can almost double the productivity  Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2007) 77:779–788  compared to the batch mode 
 comparison of the fed-batch shake flask with the fed-batch bioreactor data shows that, in spite of the somewhat lower biomass titers, the productivity in the bioreactor was considerably higher 
he method used for feeding (manual or automatic) was not of much influence in regard to the dlFalDH production 
he previously published protocol (bioreactor without pH control) for growth on MA-HCl as C-source yielded approximately 0.8 g l−1 dry weight at the end of the exponential phase (Klein et al. 1994), which can be considered typical 
rowth is often somewhat better on methanol, but this substrate does not provide a suitable C1-source for the production of dlFalDH 
 first analysis of shake flask data showed that, via a suitable fed batch strategy, it is possible to double the biomass yield 
he reason for the observed decrease in the specific growth rate in the later stages of the cultivation is not straightforward 
ufficient nutrients to sustain growth beyond the observed level were still present 
uch a salt sensitivity may even become a critical bottleneck, as it may prevent implementing an exponential feeding strategy in the bioreactor 
hile some salt accumulation in the fermentation broth is unavoidable in a fed-batch culture, we nevertheless found that using methylamine (MA) instead of NaOH for pH correction had a beneficial effect on biomass production 
his approach has the advantage that MA can also be used as C1-source by the H. zavarzinii ZV 580, thereby lowering the amount of MA-HCl to be added during feeding concomitant to the pH control 
 second prerequisite for transfer of the dlFalDH production to the bioreactor is the addition of a suitable antifoam agent 
s shown in Table 2, between the two agents tested, the cells were very sensitive to agent SigmaA204, where the addition of 0.5% (v/v) to the growth medium caused a 47% decrease in the final biomass yield 
uch a concentration of the antifoam agent would, on the other hand, most likely not even be sufficient to prevent foaming in the bioreactor, especially towards the end of the cultivation 
nfortunately, that study did not provide any data on the effect of Tween 80 on bacterial growth 
he bacteria much better tolerated the antifoam agent Sigma-A 
he three growth phases were also observed in the bioreactor 
hile the specific growth rates in the three growth phases were similar to those calculated for the fedbatch shaker flask cultures, the final biomass was somewhat lower 
he reason for this reduced final biomass in the bioreactor is at present unclear 
n experimental error cannot be excluded, although the effect was observed reproducibly 
o avoid the occurrence of such starvation periods, an automatic ‘on demand’ feeding strategy was developed 
hile this rendered bioproduction of dlFalDH more convenient, it did, at first glance, not improve the biomass yield of the process, which dropped to 1.5 g l−1 (Fig. 5) 
ndependently of the applied feeding strategy, the growth of H. zavarzinii ZV 580 seemed to correlate with the methylamine concentration in the culture medium 
owever, the ‘on-demand’ feeding strategy led to a more than twofold increase of μmiddle phase 
nterestingly, the highest specific growth rate (0.12 h−1) was achieved at low methylamine concentration 
n the other hand, the data presented in Fig. 5 demonstrate that the diminution of the growth in the late phase is not related to a C1-source limitation 
t might be linked to the depletion of additional limiting nutrients or may be caused by the accumulation of inhibitory metabolites in the  788  fermentation medium 
owever, as an increasing salt concentration in the fermentation medium also inhibits cellular growth, an increasing osmomolarity of the medium caused by increased methylamine concentration may also negatively influence the growth rate 
his assumption is also supported by the fact that pH correction with methylamine led to a significant increase of the biomass yield 
n particular, a lower enzyme production rate was observed in the late phase of the cultivation 
his suggests a down-regulation of the dlFalDH production in correlation with the absence of MA-HCl consumption 
uch a mechanism might reflect the physiological significance of dlFalDH in the formaldehyde metabolism in H. zavarzinii ZV 580 cultured on C1 compounds

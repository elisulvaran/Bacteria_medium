Methylophilaceae were abundant in pilot-scale activated sludge reactors during a period of high nitrate and methanol concentration [12] and in a full-scale, methanol-fed, activated sludge plant [33]

 amples of the backwash water (1 sample per sampling date in WWTPA, 2 replicate samples in WWTPB) and polystyrene carrier material beads escaping from the WWTPB biofilter were collected into sterile 50 ml plastic containers 
 olecular microbiological analyses DNA extraction of each sample—from 10 mg of freezedried backwash sample material from WWTPA and WWTPB, from five frozen carrier beads from WWTPB (sample WWTPB_Car), and from the Filtropur filters containing the inflow water samples—was carried out as previously described [32] 
 or the PCR reaction, the following program was used: an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 3 min), and final elongation at 72 °C for 15 min 
 owever, the relative NO− x reduction and NOx out concentration were higher and lower, respectively, and temporally more stable, and Metf:LNO− x inflow was lower in WWTPA (Metf:LNO− ratio: 0.90–1.13; relative x inflow − − NOx reduction: 82–93%; NOx out: 66–99 µmol/L) than in − WWTPB (Metf:LNO− x inflow ratio: 0.98–1.18; relative NOx − reduction: 64–90%; NOx out: 128–870 µmol/L, when the exceptional values of 25 October were excluded) (Fig. 1, Online Resource 1) 
 hen estimated per carrier volume, the load of NO− x , O2 and methanol feeding as well as the actual NO− x reduction rate were on average lower in 3 3 WWTPA (NO− x : 570 µmol/m /s; O2: 50 µmol/m /s; methanol: 590 µmol/m3/s; actual NO− x reduction: 510 µmol/ 3 m3/s) than in WWTPB (NO− x : 890 µmol/m /s; O2: 60 µmol/ 3 3 m /s; methanol: 930 µmol/m /s; actual NO− x reduction: 730 µmol/m3/s) 
 he higher abundance of methylotrophs in WWTPB than in WWTPA could be explained by the higher availability of methanol (higher Metf:LNO− x inflow and higher Metf estimated per carrier volume) 
 imilarly, the lower O2 load (as expressed per carrier volume) could explain the higher abundance of Hyphomicrobium and the absence of Paracoccus in WWTPA 
 herefore, the lower O2, NO− x , and methanol load (as expressed per carrier volume) could both explain the lower abundance of Methylophilacea and the absence of Cluster Met I in WWTPA 
 n contrast to explaining differences between the biofilters, the availability of O2 [the O2 concentration and the O2 flow (µmol s−1) (data not shown)] did not affect the temporal variation in the community structure in WWTPA 
 owever, this discrepancy is probably due to differing expressions of the process rate, expressed as per biofilter or per volume of carrier material in our study and as per mass of biomass (mixed liquor volatile suspended solids [MLVSS]) in Ginige et al.  [10]

ombining the data with previous study results the family Methylophilaceae and genus Hyphomicrobium were determined as suitable target groups for monitoring 
eywords Methanol · Denitrification · Biofilter · Hyphomicrobium · Methylophilaceae Introduction Denitrification is an essential biotechnological process in municipal wastewater treatment plants WWTPs for reducing the nitrogen N load to recipient waters 
f the known methylotrophic denitrifiers the genus Hyphomicrobium Alphaproteobateria is frequently detected in methanolfed denitrification systems 2 6 21 27–29 35 38 and is thus considered a suitable target for monitoring methanolfed denitrification 22 
ther than the studies of Neef et al . 27 and Lemmer et al . 21 which found Paracoccus and Hyphomicrobium to be important methylotrophs in a methanol-fed denitrifying sand filter of a WWTP , very little is known about the overall bacterial dynamics or about the identity and community dynamics of methylotrophic denitrifiers in full-scale biofilters 
n addition the ecology of Hyphomicrobium differs from that of Methyloversatilis 2 , Paracoccus 21 , and Methylophilaceae 10

hese OTUs belonged to Hyphomicrobium cluster II 30 ( Table 2 Fig . 2 
he other OTU OTU 22 likely representing a different Hyphomicrobium species was only found in the carrier material of WWTPB Fig . 2 where it was more abundant than OTU 16 . 454-pyrosequencing had a lower resolution for detecting Hyphomicrobiaceae than the clone library analysis Table 2 but it showed 7 Hyphomicrobiaceae OTUs in WWTPA of which the dominant one , harboring almost all 91 % of the Hyphomicrobiaceae sequences in the 454-pyrosequencing library , was identical to OTU 16 in the clone library Fig . 2 
ll the clone library sequences with a size of 466 bp in the area amplifiable by LH-PCR primers belonged to OTU 16 within the Hyphomicrobium II cluster and all the sequences of genus Hyphomicrobium had the size of this peak see Fig . 2 
hus LHPCR peaks 466 and 521 bp were chosen as biomarkers of Hyphomicrobium and Methylophilaceae respectively 
uring the study period there was a negative correlation between the relative abundances of Hyphomicrobium and Methylophilaceae r = −0.91 p < 0.001 ( Fig . 4

Methylophilaceae were abundant in pilot-scale activated sludge reactors during a period of high nitrate and methanol concentration 12 and in a full-scale methanol-fed activated sludge plant 33 
ogether these results suggest that besides Hyphomicrobium bacteria belonging to Methylophilaceae are crucial for the function of methanol-utilizing denitrification processes 
hus Methylophilaceae can be used as a target family for monitoring denitrification in full-scale methanol-fed WWTP biofilters although Discussion Bacteria belonging to genus Hyphomicrobium inhabited both WWTP biofilters 
his agrees with the results from many previous studies e.g . 2 27 29 ) indicating that bacteria in Hyphomicrobium are crucial for the function of methanol-utilizing denitrification processes 
oreover this further confirms that Hyphomicrobium is a suitable target genus for monitoring denitrification in full-scale methanolfed WWTP biofilters 23 
apable of aerobic denitrification Paracoccus tolerates O2 better than Hyphomicrobium which thrive in anoxic conditions and thus Paracoccus were favored in the surface zones of the biofilm in a previously studied full-scale biofilter a sand filter [ 21 
his is in accordance with our results on the higher and lower relative abundance of Paracoccus and Hyphomicrobium respectively in the sheared biomass of the backwash water representing more aerobic surface biofilm than in the carrier material representing deeper anoxic biofilm in WWTPB 
imilarly the lower O2 load as expressed per carrier volume could explain the higher abundance of Hyphomicrobium and the absence of Paracoccus in WWTPA 
owever as discussed below for the temporal variation in the bacterial community in WWTPA the lower abundance of Methylophilacea and higher abundance of Hyphomicrobium in WWTPA could also be due to a lower HRT and higher surface load which could favor Hyphomicrobium over Methylophilacea 
n addition as there are variations in the response of different Hyphomicrobium species to varying NO3− 23 , the differential distribution of the two Hyphomicrobium species OTUs between the sheared biomass and carrier material in WWTPB was probably due to the decreased availability of NO3− deeper in the biofilm 
ethylotrophs and non-methylotrophs as well as the key methylotrophic groups Methylophilaceae and Hyphomicrobium responded differently to variations in the physicochemical J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol factors 
he decrease in Methylophilaceae and total methylotrophs and increase in Hyphomicrobium and nonmethylotrophs with increasing NO− x and methanol loads contrast with the above comparison between WWTPA and WWTPB 
urthermore increased physical disturbance due to increased water flow could have caused the selective removal of Methylophilaceae which would further contribute to the decrease in methylotrophs as well as to the increase in Hyphomicrobium 
rosthecae and buds of Hyphomicrobium 42 might have provided firmer attachment to the carrier material than the flagellum and ‘ prostheca-like ’ structures of Methylotenera 15 
he decrease in Methylophilaceae and total methylotrophs and increase in Hyphomicrobium and non-methylotrophs with an increasing actual NO− x reduction rate are surprising and contrast with the results from a laboratory reactor in which the relative abundance of Methylophilaceae increased and that of Hyphomicrobium did not change with increasing denitrification rate 10 
n those conditions methylotrophs might have increasingly allocated more of the methanol C into extracellular substances than into biomass and thus supported the activity of non-methylotrophs . Conclusions Combining the results of the two WWTP biofilters with those of previous studies confirms that bacteria in genus Hyphomicrobium and family Methylophilaceae are crucial components of methanol-utilizing denitrification 
hus Hyphomicrobium and Methylophilaceae can be used as target taxonomic groups to monitor the function of fullscale methanol-fed denitrification biofilters of WWTPs 
ethylotrophs and non-methylotrophs as well as Hyphomicrobium and Methylophilaceae responded differently to these variations 
urther temporal monitoring and/or experimental studies combined with modern sophisticated culture-independent stable isotope probing of DNA/RNA metatranscriptomics metagenomics as well as culture-dependent highthroughput culturing techniques are needed to resolve the exact mechanisms underlying the observed relationship among the physicochemical factors bacterial communities methylotrophs non-methylotrophs Hyphomicrobium and Methylophilaceae , and process function

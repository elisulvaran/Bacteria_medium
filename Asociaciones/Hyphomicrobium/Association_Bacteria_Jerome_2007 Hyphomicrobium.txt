he situation is made worse by the fact that the cell structure of Hyphomicrobium and its method of reproduction are fairly complex (Zavarzin 1961) 
n particular, the life cycle of Hyphomicrobium sp. exhibits three different morphological states (swarmer, hyphal, and rosette) reflecting two processes, the formation of mother cells and the formation of daughter cells, occurring at the same time (Moore and Hirsch 1973a,b, Conti and Hirsch 1965; Zavarzin 1960, Poindexter 1964) 
ultures were run as batch or fed batch, in the latter mode, MeOH or MA-HCl  Table 1 Comparison of Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 biomass obtained in the batch and fed batch mode and as a function of the C-source C1-source  Batch mode (g l−1)  Fed-batch mode (g l−1)  MeOH (0.5% v/v) 10 mM MA-HCl 25 mM MA-HCl 50 mM MA-HCl  1.2 n.d. 0.4 0.6  2.2 1.4 1.5 1.2  Biomass yield (cell dry weight, g l−1 ) determined after 78 h of culture at 30°C in shake flasks 
ubsequently, we will refer to these three growth phases as early, middle, and late phase.  Fig. 1 Culture of Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 in shake flask 
ased on the biomass data, the following specific growth rates were calculated from the slope of a plot ln N (cell concentration) against time t: 10 to 32 h, μmax =0.12 h−1; 32 to 56 h, μmax =0.04 h−1; 56 to 100 h, μmax = 0.009 h−1  Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2007) 77:779–788  Fig. 2 Inhibition of cellular growth of Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 by increasing amounts of NaCl

fterwards, the two curves slightly diverged from each other, with the bioreactor yielding less biomass than the shake flask, although the specific growth rates were almost identical in the late phase (Fig. 4).

ost importantly, this approach allowed us to increase the specific growth rate in the middle phase more than twofold.  Fig. 5 Cultivation of Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii ZV 580 in the bioreactor with automatic feeding based on the dissolved oxygen

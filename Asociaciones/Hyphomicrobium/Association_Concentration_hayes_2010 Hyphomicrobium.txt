 or sulfate analysis, at pH 7 it was determined  TABLE 3 
 etermination of the percent conversion of DMS to sulfate was not feasible for the pH 6 and pH 5 experiments due to the use of H2SO4 to lower the pH of the mineral medium, which resulted in high background sulfate levels 
 urthermore, no sulfate inhibition was observed in the Hyphomicrobium enrichment culture for sulfate concentrations below 24 g SO42⫺/ liter (33), a sulfate concentration that exceeds any sulfate concentration measured in this study by at least an order of magnitude, suggesting that the decline in the specific growth rate is due to pH rather than sulfate inhibition 
 econd, DMS was completely converted to sulfate in the pH 7 experiments, and 16S rRNA gene copies from Hyphomicrobium spp. and Thiobacillus spp. accounted for the bulk of bacterial 16S rRNA genes in the batch experiments

 hrough the same pH shift, the specific growth rate and 16S rRNA gene yield of Thiobacillus spp. remained similar 
 he results of these mixed-culture batch experiments indicate that the increased DMS removal rates observed in previous studies of biofilters cotreating DMS and methanol are due to the proliferation of DMS-degrading Hyphomicrobium spp. on methanol at pH levels not conducive to high growth rates on DMS alone.  5424  APPL

 either of these was significantly different at the 95% confidence level from the respective yields obtained at pH 6, but both were significantly lower than the respective yields at pH 7 (P ⫽ 0.034 and P ⫽ 0.0030, respectively) 
 owever, a study of an enrichment culture believed to be dominated by Hyphomicrobium spp. (observed by microscopy) had a maximum DMS degradation rate somewhere between pH 6.0 and 7.0 
 owever, in a biotrickling filter study, where nearly 100% removal efficiencies were achieved and the microbial community was typically composed of more than 10% Thiobacillus spp. and less than 0.1% Hyphomicrobium spp. on a total bacterial 16S rRNA gene basis, the DMS degradation rate remained robust (⬃90% removal efficiency) as the pH of the recirculation medium was adjusted to pH 5 over the course of 1 day (31) 
 iven that these experiments were carried out only over the course of a day, it is unknown if the results would have been sustainable in the long term, but the batch data in this study suggest that there are Thiobacillus spp. that can grow equally well at pH 5 and pH 7 over the long term 
 t has long been known that Hyphomicrobium spp. could be enriched from environmental samples equally quickly in media at pH values between 5.5 and 8.0 (2) 
 he difference with respect to pH in growth rates on methanol and DMS for Hyphomicrobium spp. could be the result of different pH optima of the enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway of these compounds 
 owever, methanol dehydrogenases have been shown to remain stable and retain their activity after incubation for 45 h in buffer from pH 5 to pH 10, with the optimum activity occurring  Downloaded from http://aem.asm.org/ on February 15, 2018 by guest  estimate biomass (versus volatile suspended solids [VSS], for example) since the maximum specific growth rate measured in this study for Hyphomicrobium spp. on methanol (0.15 h⫺1) is similar to the maximum specific growth rates on methanol for Hyphomicrobium VS (0.14 h⫺1) (27) and Hyphomicrobium X (0.10 h⫺1) (15) 
 iomass yields of both Hyphomicrobium spp. and Thiobacillus spp. were significantly lower in the enrichment culture at pH 7 than both the theoretical yield calculated using bioenergetics and biomass yields of pure cultures grown on DMS reported in the literature

 his and the fact that Hyphomicrobium spp. can be isolated almost equally as quickly from environmental samples from pH 5.5 to pH 8.0 suggest a wide pH range in which methanol dehydrogenase is active in vivo (2) 
 e Bont et al. (7) performed the first studies on cell extracts and assayed both DMS monooxygenase and methyl mercaptan oxidase at pH 7.2 but reported low activities for DMS monooxygenase that may have been the result of suboptimal assay conditions 
 irst, they highlight the importance of pH control in biofiltration and other biotechnological systems designed to remove DMS where the microbial community is comprised of a significant quantity of Hyphomicrobium spp 
 econd, these results show that in systems where pH may be difficult to control, such as traditional biofiltration systems, methanol addition can lead to higher DMS removal rates and removal efficiencies under conditions that are not conducive to high growth rates of Hyphomicrobium spp. on DMS alone 
 n the biofilters cotreating DMS and methanol in our previous study, Hyphomicrobium spp. were capable of growing at much higher specific growth rates on methanol than on DMS throughout the pH regime that was employed in these biofilters 
 uo, J., and M 
 t was demonstrated that the DMS degradation rate in biofilters where the pH of the biofilter bed was allowed to acidify naturally over time to pH 5 before the pH was neutralized back to pH 7 could be increased by up to 11-fold with methanol cotreatment (47) 
 he increase in the DMS removal rates was shown to be the result of an order of magnitude increase in the concentration of Hyphomicrobium spp., which were also capable of growth on methanol (16) 
 hen the pH of the medium was decreased from pH 7 to pH 5, the specific growth rate of Hyphomicrobium spp. decreased by 85%, with a near 100-fold decline in the yield of Hyphomicrobium 16S rRNA gene copies in the mixed culture 
 hen methanol was used as a substrate, the specific growth rate of Hyphomicrobium spp. declined much less over the same pH range (up to 30%) while the yield of 16S rRNA gene copies declined by only 50% 
 witching from an NH4ⴙ-N-based source to a NO3ⴚ-N-based source resulted in the same trends for the specific growth rate of these microorganisms with respect to pH 
 his suggests that pH has far more impact on the growth kinetics of these microorganisms than the nitrogen source 
 o test different pH conditions, the initial pH of the medium was lowered by adding the necessary volume of a 0.2 M H2SO4 solution 
 o determine specific growth rates, the natural logarithm of the number of 16S rRNA gene copies per ml of medium was plotted versus time 
 he specific growth rate of Hyphomicrobium spp. on DMS was strongly affected by the pH of the mineral medium while the nitrogen source had no significant effect on the specific growth rate of Hyphomicrobium spp. (Table 2) 
 he same trend was observed for the yield of Hyphomicrobium spp., where large declines were observed in the yield with decreasing pH

 t pH 6, the specific growth rate in the NH4⫹-N medium was 0.080 h⫺1, which was not significantly different from the specific growth rate at pH 7 (P ⫽ 0.77) 
 owever, in the NO3⫺-N medium the specific growth rate was 0.065 h⫺1, which was significantly lower than the specific growth rate in the NO3⫺-N medium at pH 7 (P ⫽ 0.022) 
 either of  the specific growth rates was significantly different at the 95% confidence level from the values in the respective medium at either pH 6 or pH 7 
 he yield of Thiobacillus spp. was also consistent across the pH ranges tested 
 he minimum yield of 1.4 ⫻ 106 16S rRNA gene copies per ␮mol of DMS consumed occurred at pH 6 in the NH4⫹-N medium while the maximum yield of 3.5 ⫻ 106 16S  FIG. 3

 o information was found on the number of 16S rRNA genes per Hyphomicrobium cell, so an assumption of 1 16S rRNA gene copy per cell was assumed 
 t pH 7, the ratio of 16S rRNA gene copies from Hyphomicrobium spp. to total bacterial 16S rRNA genes averaged 1.09 ⫾ 0.68 
 he pH of the mineral medium had only a slight effect on the specific growth rate of Hyphomicrobium spp. for the range tested 
 s for the effect of nitrogen source on yield, there were no significant differences at any pH value at the 95% confidence level 
 he yield of Hyphomicrobium spp. on methanol in this enrichment culture was compared to the reported yield of Hyphomicrobium VS from the literature as well as to the theoretical biomass yield at pH 7 with an NH4⫹-N nitrogen source  TABLE 5 
 n the case of Hyphomicrobium spp., experiments on pure cultures were all carried out at pH 7 only 
 hen the pH of the enrichment culture was decreased to 5.0, the DMS degradation rate decreased to 50% of the maximum DMS degradation rate (32) 
 his is consistent with observations in the enrichment culture in this study that showed that the specific growth rate and, by extension, the DMS degradation rate, of Hyphomicrobium spp. decreased by up to 85% when the pH was decreased from pH 7 to pH 5 
 s for Thiobacillus spp., the specific growth rate of T. thioparus Tk-m was reported to decrease by 50% as the pH decreased from pH 7.7 to pH 6.1, with no growth occurring at pH 5.6 (19) 
 hile decreasing the pH of the medium from pH 7 to pH 5 had a deleterious effect on the growth kinetics of Hyphomicrobium spp. on DMS, it had only a minimal effect on the growth kinetics of Hyphomicrobium spp. on methanol 
 his suggests that that the specific growth rates for Hyphomicrobium spp. are similar within this pH range, which is consistent with results in this study for Hyphomicrobium spp. growing on methanol 
 ethanol dehydrogenase is a well-studied enzyme in the literature; methanol oxidation occurs in the periplasmic space via an electron transport chain, with the initial step of methanol dehydrogenase oxidizing cytochrome cL at a pH optimum of pH 7.0 (1) 
 irst, when methanol was the substrate, a similar, approximately 65% underestimate of the biomass yield was observed at pH 7 for Hyphomicrobium spp. compared to the biomass yield of Hyphomicrobium VS in pure culture 
 hile there was a clear deterioration in the ability of Hyphomicrobium spp. to grow on DMS as the pH decreased from pH 7 to pH 5, Thiobacillus spp. maintained their ability to grow on DMS as the pH decreased from pH 7 to pH 5 
 here is very little information on the effect of pH on the growth kinetics of  5429  5430  HAYES ET AL.  biomass that leads to increased DMS degradation in these biofilters 
 uylen et al. (37) reported that the pH optimum for methyl mercaptan oxidase in Hyphomicrobium EG was pH 8.2 
 t is possible that the higher pH optimum of methyl mercaptan oxidase and, perhaps of DMS monooxygenase, results in the more rapid decline of the specific growth rate of Hyphomicrobium spp. on DMS than on methanol as the pH decreases from pH 7 to pH 5 
 ssuming an airwater partition coefficient of 0.07 for DMS (28), the approximate aqueous concentration of DMS in our batch studies is 300 ␮M while the approximate concentration of DMS in the biofilm of our biofilters, with an inlet DMS concentration of 20 parts per million by volume (ppmv), would be approximately 10 ␮M 
 he half-velocity constant, KS, of the biofilter microbial community was determined to be 0.2 ␮M (49), but even if the biofilter microbial community had a KS on DMS similar to that of Hyphomicrobium VS (3 ␮M) (27), it would be expected that the specific growth rate at pH 7 would be approximately 0.07 h⫺1, not 0.012 h⫺1, which is a value that is more analogous to the specific growth rate at pH 5 in the batch studies 
 n other words, the pH conditions in these biofilters resulted in much lower specific growth rates than can be achieved by Hyphomicrobium spp. at pH 7 
 his suggests that these Hyphomicrobium spp. still grow at a lower than optimal specific growth rate on DMS in the presence of methanol but that methanol addition results in an increase in the concentration of Hyphomicrobium  APPL

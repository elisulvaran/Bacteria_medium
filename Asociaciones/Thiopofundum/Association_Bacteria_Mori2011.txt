ther substrates including organic acids and sugars did not support growth indicating that strain gps61T was an obligate chemolithoautotroph . 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain gps61T was closely related to Thioprofundum lithotrophicum 106T 98.5 % sequence similarity in the order Chromatiales 
hylogenetic trees grouped strain gps61T and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum in the same cluster along with Thioalkalispira microaerophila and Thiohalophilus thiocyanoxidans but it was apparent from the analysis that the novel strain had definitely departed from the family lineage 
n the basis of its phylogenetic position along with its morphological and physiological characteristics strain gps61T 5NBRC 101261T 5DSM 18546T represents a novel species of the genus Thioprofundum for which the name Thioprofundum hispidum sp . nov. is proposed 
n addition we propose a novel family name Thioalkalispiraceae in the order Chromatiales to accommodate the genera Thioalkalispira Thiohalophilus and Thioprofundum . Hydrothermal vents have been discovered worldwide and host peculiar ecosystems that include chemolithoautotrophs as primary producers 
n addition several environmental strains belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria have been retrieved from hydrothermal fields cold-seep sediments and marine crusts Arakawa et al. 2006 Inagaki et al. 2004 Li et al. 1999 Santelli et al. 2008 some of which have been Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by 026963 G 2011 IUMS IP 132.247.101.80 On Tue 03 Apr 2018 22:58:20 Printed in Great Britain Thioprofundum hispidum sp . nov. suggested as having sulfur-oxidizing metabolism Hirayama et al. 2007 Sunamura et al. , 2004 
ased on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis the isolate belonged to the genus Thioprofundum of the order Chromatiales 
he phylogenetic analyses Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 61 IP 132.247.101.80 On Tue 03 Apr 2018 22:58:20 Thioprofundum hispidum sp . nov. indicated that strain gps61T was a member of the genus Thioprofundum Takai et al. 2009 in the order Chromatiales in the class Gammaproteobacteria Fig . 2 and Supplementary Fig 
he sequence similarity between strain gps61T and its closest neighbour Thioprofundum lithotrophicum was 98.5 % 
hioalkalispira microaerophila and Thiohalophilus thiocyanoxidans were members of the same cluster albeit with somewhat lower similarity to the Thioprofundum strains ~93–94 % 
haracteristics of strain gps61T and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum are summarized in Table 1 
owever strain gps61T clearly differed from Thioprofundum lithotrophicum in the following characteristics 
ptimum growth of Thioprofundum lithotrophicum was observed at 50 uC whereas strain gps61T grew optimally at 39 uC and could not grow at 50 uC 
train gps61T was able to grow in the presence of 20 % oxygen whereas Thioprofundum lithotrophicum was unable to grow at oxygen concentrations .5 % 
he genomic DNA G+C content differed between strain gps61T 63 mol % and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum 66 mol %

Growth temperature only not optimum was reported . between strain gps61T and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum showed relatedness values of only 11–21 % strongly suggesting that they should be classified as different species 
ased on its phylogenetic position as well as its phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties strain gps61T represents a novel species for which the name Thioprofundum hispidum sp . nov. is proposed 
hylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain gps61T and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum could be clearly distinguished from the families Chromatiaceae Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Halothiobacillaceae of the order Chromatiales in the class Gammaproteobacteria Fig . 2 
n our phylogenetic analyses however Thioalkalispira microaerophila and Thiohalophilus thiocyanoxidans were part of the same lineage along with strain gps61T and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum 
ome phenotypic features of Thioalkalispira microaerophila and Thiohalophilus thiocyanoxidans such as chemolithoautotrophy sulfur-oxidation and moderately halophily were similar to those of strain gps61T and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum Table 1 
ccordingly we propose the new family name Thioalkalispiraceae fam . nov. 2416 in the order Chromatiales to accommodate the genera Thioalkalispira Thiohalophilus and Thioprofundum

hioprofundum lithotrophicum is a moderately thermophilic piezophilic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium isolated from a black smoker chimney in the Mid Atlantic Ridge Takai et al. 2009 whose 16S rRNA gene sequence was very similar to that of strain gps61T as were some of its phenotypic features 
hioprofundum lithotrophicum used sulfite as an electron donor unlike strain gps61T

he phylogenetic analyses indicated that strain gps52T is a member of the order Chromatiales in the class Gammaproteobacteria . http //ijs.sgmjournals.org However the sequence of strain gps52T was distant from those of all known genera in the order and the closest relatives were Natronocella acetinitrilica and Methylonatrum kenyense in the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae with sequence similarities of 92.7 and 92.6 % respectively 
he sequence similarities between strain gps52T and species in the order with validly published names were 87.9–92.7 % for the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae 90.5–92.3 % for the family Thioalkalispiraceae 90.4–90.9 % for the family Granulosicoccaceae 86.6–90.2 % for the family Chromatiaceae and 85.6–89.4 % for the family Halothiobacillaceae

he members of the genera Thiohalomonas and Thiohalospira prefer extremely halophilic conditions for growth but strain gps52T grew optimally at 3 % w/v NaCl 
iven the unique phenotypic features of strain gps52T and considering its solitary lineage in the phylogenetic trees and its low sequence similarities with species of the order Chromatiales it is clear that this novel strain can not be assigned to any previously recognized genera

Optimum NaCl concentration of Thioalkalivibrio halophilus is exceptionally 12 % . The order Chromatiales contains five families and includes various types of bacteria such as phototrophs chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs 
he family Granulosicoccaceae in the order Chromatiales contains one genus Granulosicoccus and it is an obligately chemoheterotrophic bacterium Kurilenko et al. 2010 Lee et al. 2007 
ubsequently two other genera Acidiferrobacter and Thioalbus were added to the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae but the phylogenetic analyses did not consider the family Granulosicoccaceae Hallberg et al. 2011 Park et al. 2011 
n our phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences the boundaries of the families Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Thioalkalispiraceae were obscure and the families could not be regarded as independent lineages 
his is likely to arise from the deep branching of some genera of the families Ectothiorhodospiraceae Thioalkalispiraceae and Granulosicoccaceae in the order Chromatiales 
t this point it is difficult to clearly divide these deep-branching genera such as Thioprofundum Granulosicoccus Acidiferrobacter Methylohalomonas Natronocella Methylonatrum Thioalbus and our proposed genus

he type strain is gps52T 5NBRC 101260T5DSM 19610T 
he type species is Thiogranum longum 
naerobic or photosynthetic growth is not observed 
he initial pH for growth is pH 6.0–7.5 with an optimum at pH 6.5 
hlorobium ferrooxidans sp . nov. a phototrophic green sulfur bacterium that oxidizes ferrous iron in coculture with a ‘ ‘ Geospirillum ’ ’ sp . strain 
he strain grew with 2–4 % w/v NaCl with an optimum concentration of 3 % NaCl 
he NaCl concentration for growth ranges from 1 to 5 % w/v , with an optimum at 3 % 
or tree reconstruction 1047 positions were used 
ecause better growth was observed in AP8SO2 than in AP8SO1 medium AP8SO2 medium was subsequently used for isolation 
he initial pH range for growth was pH 6.0–7.5 with an optimum of pH 6.5 
rows at 19–35 uC optimal growth at 32 uC

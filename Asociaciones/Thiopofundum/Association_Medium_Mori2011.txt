ther substrates including organic acids and sugars did not support growth indicating that strain gps61T was an obligate chemolithoautotroph . 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain gps61T was closely related to Thioprofundum lithotrophicum 106T 98.5 % sequence similarity in the order Chromatiales 
hylogenetic trees grouped strain gps61T and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum in the same cluster along with Thioalkalispira microaerophila and Thiohalophilus thiocyanoxidans but it was apparent from the analysis that the novel strain had definitely departed from the family lineage 
n the basis of its phylogenetic position along with its morphological and physiological characteristics strain gps61T 5NBRC 101261T 5DSM 18546T represents a novel species of the genus Thioprofundum for which the name Thioprofundum hispidum sp . nov. is proposed 
n addition we propose a novel family name Thioalkalispiraceae in the order Chromatiales to accommodate the genera Thioalkalispira Thiohalophilus and Thioprofundum . Hydrothermal vents have been discovered worldwide and host peculiar ecosystems that include chemolithoautotrophs as primary producers 
wo supplementary figures are available with the online version of this paper . 2412 Aquificae and Proteobacteria have been found in hydrothermal vent systems 
he class Gammaproteobacteria contains many environmental strains derived from symbiotic bacteria associated with invertebrates living in hydrothermal vents and cold-seep systems 
n addition several environmental strains belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria have been retrieved from hydrothermal fields cold-seep sediments and marine crusts Arakawa et al. 2006 Inagaki et al. 2004 Li et al. 1999 Santelli et al. 2008 some of which have been Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by 026963 G 2011 IUMS IP 132.247.101.80 On Tue 03 Apr 2018 22:58:20 Printed in Great Britain Thioprofundum hispidum sp . nov. suggested as having sulfur-oxidizing metabolism Hirayama et al. 2007 Sunamura et al. , 2004

t the time of writing the order Chromatiales included three families namely Chromatiaceae Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Halothiobacillaceae 
pecies belonging to the families Chromatiaceae and Ectothiorhodospiraceae are mainly anoxygenic photolithoautotrophic bacteria which are able to oxidize sulfur compounds under anaerobic conditions by using light Imhoff 2005a b 
n the other hand the family Halothiobacillaceae contains non-photosynthetic chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria isolated from hypersaline marine and terrestrial environments containing hydrothermal vent systems its members can oxidize sulfur compounds under aerobic conditions Durand et al. 1993 Ito et al. 2005 Mori & Suzuki 2008 Sievert et al. 2000 
n this study a group of previously uncharacterized bacterial strains found in hydrothermal fields and cold-seep sediments were found to be phylogenetically distant from the above families but formed a distinct clade within the order Chromatiales 
ata from phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses suggested that strain gps61T warrants classification as a novel species 
n the basis of our phylogenetic analysis it is also proposed that a new family be created to encompass the novel strain and its closest relatives

ased on its phylogenetic position as well as its phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties strain gps61T represents a novel species for which the name Thioprofundum hispidum sp . nov. is proposed 
hylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain gps61T and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum could be clearly distinguished from the families Chromatiaceae Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Halothiobacillaceae of the order Chromatiales in the class Gammaproteobacteria Fig . 2 
urthermore this lineage contained Thioalkalispira microaerophila and Thiohalophilus thiocyanoxidans 
orokin et al . 2002 reported that Thioalkalispira microaerophila is an alkaliphilic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium and the phylogenetic position was deeply branched and obscured in the class Gammaproteobacteria subsequently it was tentatively classed as a member of the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae based on the taxonomic outlines of Bergey ’ s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology http //www.bergeys.org/outlines.html

either extensive internal membranes nor storage materials were present in the cells 
o date novel chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the phyla The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain gps61T is AB266389 
ome previously uncharacterized bacterial strains from culture-independent analyses have been identified as possible sulfur-oxidizers belonging to the order Chromatiales of the class Gammaproteobacteria 
his suggested that the creation of a new family was necessary to encompass these strains 
o our knowledge no such taxon has previously been proposed despite the fact that these isolates are clearly separate from recognized families Sorokin et al. 2007 Takai et al. 2009 
his is likely to be because of the highly complex nature of higher taxa in the class Gammaproteobacteria 
n this study an obligately chemolithoautotrophic sulfuroxidizing bacterium designated strain gps61T was isolated from a rock sample collected from the hydrothermal field on Suiyo Seamount 
ased on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis the isolate belonged to the genus Thioprofundum of the order Chromatiales 
train gps61T was isolated from Suiyo Seamount located in the Izu-Bonin Arc in the Western Pacific Ocean 28u 349 N 140u 399 E

he rock core samples were collected near the black smoker hydrothermal vents ~300 uC 
fter incubation for 1 week thiosulfate was partly converted into elemental sulfur in the enrichment culture 
hese phenomena suggested that the small but significant production of elemental sulfur was due to biotic oxidation of thiosulfate by the rod-shaped micro-organisms present in the vials 
hese culture conditions were used for the isolation of the thiosulfate-oxidizer by serial dilution 
bservation using electron microscopy revealed that the cells had neither storage compounds nor extensive internal membranes 
n the presence of thiosulfate under an atmosphere of N2/CO2 80 20 v/v 150 kPa exposure to light from a halogen lamp did not induce growth of strain gps61T therefore , the isolate was not capable of anoxygenic photosynthesis 
he isolate contained menaquinone but we were unable to determine the isoprenoid side chain length due to the low extraction amount 
he pH of the AP8SO2 medium was adjusted by the addition of 10 % w/v Na2CO3 or 0.2 M HCl 
lthough slight growth was observed at 50 uC during the first enrichment process microbial activity was not detected at that temperature 
he nearly complete sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of strain gps61T was determined following methods described previously Hattori et al. 2000 
nvironmental clone sequences were used for analysis after screens for chimeras were performed using the Mallard program Ashelford et al. 2006 
his cluster was recovered in all phylogenetic trees reconstructed using different analytical methods despite the fact that the bootstrap score at the node obtained from the neighbour-joining method was not particularly high 
he phylogenetic analyses also suggested that the cluster which included gps61T should be separated from the environmental clone cluster that included invertebrate symbionts 
2 , which suggests the need for reclassification of this group 
hioprofundum lithotrophicum is a moderately thermophilic piezophilic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium isolated from a black smoker chimney in the Mid Atlantic Ridge Takai et al. 2009 whose 16S rRNA gene sequence was very similar to that of strain gps61T as were some of its phenotypic features

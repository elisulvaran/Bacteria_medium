ased on the 16S rRNA gene sequence strain 106 would represent a novel genus of the previously uncultivated group Symbiont Group I a potentially novel family within the Gammaproteobacteria and ‘ Thioprofundum lithotrophica ’ gen. nov. sp . nov. is proposed 
inally based on physiological and molecular properties of both strains we propose here new species of new genera named ‘ Thioprofundum lithotrophica ’ and ‘ Piezobacter thermophilus ’ for strains 106 and 108 respectively 
escription of Thioprofundum gen. nov 
ased on 16S rRNA gene analysis the genus Thioprofundum is related to the endosymbionts of the deep-sea animals within the Gammaproteobacteria 
hioprofundum Thi.o.pro ’ fu.n.dum 
hioprofundum sulfur oxidizer from deep sea 
hioprofundum lithotrophica li.tho.tro ’ phi.ca

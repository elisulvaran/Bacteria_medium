he piezophilic cultivation technique can be a powerful tool to isolate and characterize the previously uncultivated phylotypes in the deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments 
ntroduction Research on deep-sea piezophiles has half century of history since the pioneering work by Zobell and Morita (1957) 
hermophilic hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus were isolated from deep-sea and deep subsurface environments originally by conventional, nonpiezophilic cultivation techniques but were later found to be facultative piezophilic based on the hyperbaric pressure cultivation experiments (Bernhardt et al., 1988; Miller et al., 1988) 
evertheless, all the deep-sea piezophilic chemolithoautotrophs studied so far were initially isolated by the cultures under the conventional gas pressures (up to 0.4 MPa), and none of the chemolithoautotrophs is obtained by a high-pressure culture directly from a deep-sea habitat 
irect piezophilic enrichment from deep-sea and deep subsurface microbial communities would be advantageous to obtain the numerically predominant or the functionally significant microbial populations in the in situ habitats 
akai et al. affecting their growth (Abe et al., 1999; Kato, 2006) but also because the pressure and temperature serve as the primary physicochemical factors preparing the thermodynamic states of energy and carbon metabolisms for their growth 
he different abundance of the gaseous energy and carbon sources may be a great metabolic bias for enrichment of certain populations that are less predominant in the in situ habitats but are energetically favourable in laboratory experiments 
n contrast, if the piezophilic cultivation provides quite dissimilar thermodynamic states compared with those of the in situ habitats, it may lead to enrichment of previously uncultivated and unidentified microbial components of the similar environments 
he TAG field is located at water depth of between 3620 and 3660 m and is among the world deepest hot hydrothermal systems 
he H2- and/or sulfur-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs are one of the most predominant microbial populations in the global deep-sea hydrothermal environments and a diversity of Aquificae and Epsilonproteobacteria members have been isolated as the primary components (Nakagawa and Takai, 2006; 2008; Takai et al., 2006a) 
lthough only one pressure–temperature (PT) condition of 50°C and 36 MPa and only one medium were used in this study, two novel chemolithoautotrophic bacteria were enriched and isolated by purification under different pressure conditions 
he physiological properties of the new deep-sea piezophiles were characterized under the piezophilic cultivation condition.  Results and discussion Chimney habitats and total, viable and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) cell counts At the present, it is still very difficult to determine directly the physical and chemical conditions of the microbial  habitats in the chimney structure by using some of the in situ hardware such as temperature, pH and other chemical sensors at the deep seafloor 
hus, the potential chemical conditions for a given temperature range of chimney habitat have been often extrapolated by the mixing between the hot end-member hydrothermal fluid and the cold ambient seawater (McCollom and Shock, 1997; Shock and Holland, 2004; Tivey, 2004) 
ccording to the chemical composition of the endmember hydrothermal fluid in ‘the black smoker complex (BSC)’ of the TAG field already reported (Campbell et al., 1988; Charlou et al., 1996; Chiba et al., 2001), the potential concentration ranges of gaseous energy and carbon substrates in the chimney habitats were estimated 
f the microbially habitable temperature range was assumed to be up to ~130°C that could be brought by a simple mixing of approximately 1:2 ratio between the hydrothermal fluid and the seawater in the case of the TAG field, the available concentrations of dissolved H2, N2, CO2, CH4 and H2S are estimated to be up to 0.12, 0.3, 3.4, 0.05 and 2.3 mM, respectively, based on the highest values reported by Campbell and colleagues (1988) and Charlou and colleagues (1996) 
he total dissolved concentrations of H2, SCO2 and reduced sulfur compounds were about 10, 30 and 10 mM in Piezo-MMJHS medium and < 1.3, 30 and 10 mM in non-piezophilic MMJHS medium at 50°C respectively 
hus, the enrichment by using PiezoMMJHS medium might provide a larger chemical dissimilarity than that under the non-piezophilic condition, particularly in dissolved H2 concentration, between the in situ habitats and the laboratory experiments 
he dissolved H2 concentration and hydrostatic pressure could be significantly different under piezophilic and non-piezophilic enrichment culture conditions 
he total cell counts in the chimney inside and surface habitats were 3.2 ¥ 105 ⫾ 7.2 ¥ 104 and 9.6 ¥ 106 ⫾ 4.0 ¥ 105 cells g-1 (wet weight) respectively 
rom the chimney surface habitat, members of the genera Thermococcus, Deferribacter, Persephonella and Sulfurimonas were cultivated as the predominant populations 
he viable cell counts of these members were 106-107 cells g-1 for Thermococcus, 103-104 cells g-1 for Deferribacter, 105-106 cells g-1 for Persephonella and 105-106 cells g-1 for Sulfurimonas respectively 
ased on these viable cell counts by the serial dilution cultivation experiments under the nonpiezophilic condition, the predominant H2- and/or S-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophic members in the TAG  © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 11, 1983–1997  Isolation of novel piezophilic chemoautotrophs 1985 black smoker chimney surface were represented by Persephonella spp. within the Aquificae and Sulfurimonas spp. within the Epsilonproteobacteria, which has been commonly observed in other chimney habitats of the different hydrothermal systems (e.g 
n the other hand, based on the estimation of the viable cell counts under the piezophilic cultivation condition, strains 106 and 108 represented 0.6–3.0 ¥ 103 cells g-1 and 1.5–7.5 ¥ 104 cells g-1 respectively 
hese population sizes were lower than that of the Persephonella members growing at the same temperature under the non-piezophilic cultivation condition, but represented 0.01–0.3% (for strain 106) and 0.2–7.5% (for strain 108) of the sum of viable cell counts in the chimney surface habitat 
his morphotype of microorganism was successfully cultivated and isolated from the highest dilution of culture using Piezo-MMJHS medium 
hus, the viable cell count of strain 106 under the non-piezophilic cultivation condition was considered to be 105-106 cells g-1, which was equivalent to that of the Persephonella members and 1–50% of the sum of viable cell counts 
hese results suggested that both strains 106 and 108 were novel microbial components previously uncultivated from other deep-sea hydrothermal systems but potentially represented the functionally significant H2and/or S-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophic components in the chimney structure of the TAG field 
he estimation of the cellular abundance of strains 106 and 108 by the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated that both strains can be not only the functionally and metabolically significant members in the viable microbial populations but also the numerically considerable components in the total cell count of the microbial community 
he proportion of strains 106 and 108 cells in the total cell counts determined by the 4′,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and the hybridization with either the bacterial or the archaeal probe (EUB338 or ARC915) was 3.4% and 3.6% for strain 106 and 1.1% and 1.2% for strain 108 respectively 
hese results were not so inconsistent with the proportion of viable populations of strains 106 and 108 in the sum of viable cell counts determined by the cultivation experiments 
t seems likely therefore that the piezophilic cultivation technique is a powerful experimental scheme to explore the previously uncultivated but ecophysiologically significant chemolithoautotrophs in the deep-sea hydrothermal environments.  Morphological, physiological and metabolic properties of strain 106 Cells of strain 106 were motile (not all the cells but some), long, thin spiral and approximately 6–20 mm long and 0.4–0.6 mm wide, with a polar flagellum under the piezophilic cultivation condition (Fig. 1A) 
s compared with other deep-sea chemolithoautotrophs having similar growth temperature ranges with the Aquificae and Epsilonproteobacteria, strain 106 was morphologically novel 
train 106 autotrophically grew at a temperature range between 30°C and 55°C (optimally 50°C) (Fig. 2A), at a pH range between 5.8 and 7.6 (optimally pH 7.0) (Fig. 2B) and at a NaCl range from 1.2 to 4.2 (%; w/v) (optimally 3%) (Fig. 2C) under the piezophilic cultivation condition 
n addition, the growth of strain 106 was observed at a hydrostatic pressure range between 0.2 and 36 MPa, and the highest growth rate was identified at 16 MPa (Fig. 3) 
he ability of strain 106 to utilize various electron donors, electron acceptors and carbon sources was investigated using a range of substrates under the piezophilic and non-piezophilic conditions (Table 1)

Morphological, physiological and metabolic properties of strain 108 Cells of strain 108 were non-motile, short, oval and approximately 1–1.5 mm long and 0.6–0.7 mm wide under  any of the cultivation conditions (Fig. 1C) 
train 108 autotrophically grew at a temperature range between 30°C and 55°C (optimally 50°C) (Fig. 2A), at a pH range between 5.5 and 7.5 (optimally pH 6.5–7.0) (Fig. 2B) and at a NaCl range from 1.2 to 5.4 (%; w/v) (optimally 2%) (Fig. 2C) under the piezophilic cultivation condition 
he autotrophic growth of strain 108 was strictly piezophilic and was observed at a hydrostatic pressure range between 16 and 65 MPa, and the highest growth rate was obtained at 36 MPa (Fig. 3) 
t has been reported that many deep-sea hydrothermal vent hyperthermophilic heterotrophs demonstrate the greater hydrostatic pressure optima for growth than the pressure corresponding to their seafloor habitats (Deming and Baross, 1993) 
he difference in hydrostatic pressure at which the hyperthermophiles grow favourably in the laboratory experiments and naturally in the in situ seafloor may point to the possible existence of deep, hot subseafloor biosphere beneath the hydrothermal active seafloor (Deming and Baross, 1993) 
nlike many hyperthermophilic heterotrophs such as Thermococales members, the growth pressure optima of strains 106 and 108 matched the water depth range of many seafloor hydrothermal systems in the present Earth (> 1000–< 4000 m)

he energy and carbon metabolisms of strain 108 were quite different from those of strain 106 (Table 1) 
t was capable of both chemolithoautotrophic and organotrophic growth (Table 1) 
he possible inorganic electron donor to support the growth was H2, elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, cystein-HCl, tetrathionate or sulfite, and various organic compounds such as yeast extract, tryptone, acetate and pyruvate also served as the energy sources (Table 1) 
hese results demonstrate that strain 108 is a piezophilic, facultatively anaerobic and  chemolithoautotrophic, thermophile 
imilarly as strain 106, molecular nitrogen (N2) could be utilized as a sole nitrogen source although the existence of genetic components of N2 fixation enzymes (nif genes) and the 15 N2 incorporation into the cellular nitrogens were not experimentally checked 
hese results demonstrated that strain 108 was a piezophilic, N2Oproducing H2 and S oxidizer under the chemolithoautotrophic growth condition 
train 108 was also sensitive to a variety of antibiotics, including chloramphenicol (50 mg ml-1), streptomycin (50 mg ml-1), kanamycin (50 mg ml-1), ampicillin (50 mg ml-1) and vancomycin (50 mg ml-1) 
he different patterns in the compositions of both strains were notable between the cells grown under the piezophilic and non-piezophilic conditions (Table 2) 
evertheless, an increasing ratio of total unsaturated  fatty acids to saturated fatty acids with an increasing hydrostatic pressure initially suggested by DeLong and Yayanos (1985; 1986) still works as a very practical principle in most cases 
enetic characteristics The G+C contents of the genomic DNA were found to be 65.7 mol% for strain 106 and 66.2 mol% for strain 108 respectively 
he nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences of both strains (1487 bp for strain 106 and 1302 bp for strain 108) were determined and applied to the sequence similarity analysis

hylogenetic tree of representative species and endosymbionts within the Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria including strain 106 and 108 
o characterize the phylogenetic relationship between the new isolates and the previously described species within the Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed together with the representative environmental clones and species reported so far (Fig. 5) 
he tree indicated that strain 106 was phylogenetically associated with many of the thioautotrophic gammaproteobacterial endosymbionts in the deep-sea chemosynthetic animals, which are tentatively classified into the Symbiont Group I including the endosymbionts in tubeworms and snails and the Symbiont Group II consisting of the thioautotrophic endosymbionts of mussels and clams (Fig. 5) 
train 108 was the first member of the Rhodobacteraceae and the first thermophilic and chemolithoautotrophic alphaproteobacterium isolated from the deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments (e.g 
akagawa and Takai, 2006; 2008), and even represented a novel alphaproteobacterial phylotype identified in the global deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments (Takai et al., 2006a).  Taxonomic and ecological implications The exploration of thermophilic H2- and/or S-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs under the piezophilic condition corresponding to an in situ hydrostatic pressure of the TAG hydrothermal field has led to the successful isolation of previously uncultured, two novel, piezophilic, chemolithoautotrophic Proteobacteria 
hese new piezophilic chemolithoautotrophs represented the functionally and metabolically significant members in the viable microbial populations and even the numerically considerable components in the microbial community of the black smoker chimney habitat 
n this study, the piezophilic cultivation condition was designed to reproduce the in situ hydrostatic pressure but not to reproduce the chemical condition, particularly dissolved concentrations of gaseous energy and carbon sources, of the in situ habitats 
he dissimilarity in the chemical conditions may result in the successful enrichment and isolation of novel piezophilic chemolithoautotrophs in this study 
his is one aspect of application of the piezophilic cultivation technique to the microbial exploration in the deep-sea and deep subsurface 
n contrast, using our piezophilic cultivation technique or similar techniques, the nearly complete reproduction of physical and chemical conditions of the in situ habitats in the  © 2009 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Environmental Microbiology, 11, 1983–1997  Isolation of novel piezophilic chemoautotrophs 1991 laboratory could promote to excavate the numerically and functionally dominating but previously uncultivated microorganisms 
he isolation of two novel chemolithoautotrophic Proteobacteria from the TAG hydrothermal field is also of great interest from the aspect of systematic and evolutionary bacteriology 
hus, strain 106 will be an excellent comparative research target for elucidating the evolutionary transition between the free-living and symbiotic life forms among the related deep-sea Gammaproteobacteria 
train 108 is also the first member of the family Rhodobacteraceae, which consists of many chemolithotrophic and phototrophic members (Garrity et al., 2005), from the deep-sea hydrothermal vent environments 
hus, the further investigation of strain 108 may provide an important insight into the metabolic and habitational interaction and evolution associated with interrelationship between the chemolithotrophy, phototrophy and piezophily 
inally, based on physiological and molecular properties of both strains, we propose here new species of new genera named ‘Thioprofundum lithotrophica’ and ‘Piezobacter thermophilus’ for strains 106 and 108 respectively

Experimental procedures Sample collection and fluid chemistry A sample from a black smoker chimney was obtained from the TAG hydrothermal field (26°08.23′N, 44°49.57′W) in the MAR at a depth of 3626 m by means of the remotely operative vehicle VICTOR6000 (Ifremer) in Dive#263 during the EXOMAR cruise performed in August 2005 
he chimney portions were broken by a manipulator of the VICTOR6000 and directly dropped into a sample box that had been in advance decontaminated and filled with the sterilized distilled water (Postec et al., 2005) 
or the subsamples of the microscopic observation, approximately 1 g (wet weight) of the subsample was fixed with 3 ml of filtersterilized seawater containing 3.7% (v/v) formalin for 24 h and then stored at -80°C 
ll the samples for cultivation were transferred to our laboratory under refrigeration and were preserved at 4°C prior to experiments.  The hydrothermal fluid chemistry in the TAG field is already characterized in detail (Campbell et al., 1988; Charlou et al., 1996; Chiba et al., 2001) 
he chemical composition of the end-member fluid is determined and is found to be temporally stable (Campbell et al., 1988; Charlou et al., 1996; Chiba et al., 2001).  Total direct cell counts Microbial community densities in the chimney subsamples were determined by DAPI staining direct count 
he frozen formalin-fixed chimney subsample was thawed, and then vigorously suspended with a vortex mixer 
fter 5 min of static state, 0.5 ml of formalin-fixed supernatant was added to 0.5 ml of filter-sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing DAPI (10 mg ml-1), and incubated at room temperature for 30 min 
n average total cell count was obtained from more than 100 microscopic fields from three separate filters.  Liquid serial dilution cultures To estimate the abundance of culturable microorganisms (viable counts) represented by a variety of physiological and metabolic characteristics, a series of serial dilution cultures were performed from the chimney subsamples under the various cultivation conditions, which were in a same manner as previously described (e.g 
ince the detail methods and results will be described elsewhere, only the media and culture conditions that gave positive cultivation results were described (Table 3) 
or anaerobic, heterotrophic sulfur-reducing thermophiles such as members of Thermococcales and Thermotogales, MJYPS medium (Takai et al., 2000) was used (Table 3) 
or hydrogenand/or sulfur-oxidizing chemolithoautotrophs, such as members of Aquificales, Gammaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria, MMJHS medium (Takai et al., 2003) was used (Table 3) 
 serial dilution culture using a piezophilic cultivation technique (Takai et al., 2008a) was also performed with the chimney surface sample at 50°C and at 36 MPa (Table 3) 
he microorganism present in the most diluted series of the medium at each temperature was isolated by the subsequent extinction– dilution method (Takai and Horikoshi, 2000) 
 1 ml portion of the inoculated culture was taken from each of the serial dilution of test tubes into a piezophilic cultivation syringe and then, a 250 ml of 100% H2 was added to the syringe (corresponding to approximately 10 mM soluble H2 and 30 mM SCO2 under the piezophilic condition) (Takai et al., 2008a) 
inally, the pressure vessels containing the cultivation syringes were compressed by a hydraulic pomp at 36 MPa and incubated at 50°C for 2 weeks 
p to a certain dilution of culture, two morphotypes of microorganisms were identified; one was a motile, thin, long spiral cell and the other was a non-motile, short, oval rod 
hus, the extinction–dilution purification of this morphotype was conducted by the repeated cultivation under every piezophilic and non-piezophilic condition 
inally, two morphotypes were isolated and were designated as strain 106 (long spiral cell) and strain 108 (short oval rod) respectively

he pH of the medium was routinely checked before, during and after the growth at a room temperature 
o test the effects of hydrostatic pressure and temperature on growth, cultures with Piezo-MMJHS medium were incubated at a varying hydrostatic pressure of 0.2 (non-piezophilic condition), 5, 16, 36, 50 or 65 MPa at 50°C and at every 5°C between 25°C and 60°C at the optimal pressures

Whole-cell FISH analysis The whole-cell FISH analysis was conducted to estimate the cellular abundance of strains 106 and 108 and their relatives in the in situ chimney habitat by using the 16S rRNA gene sequences 
he targeted microbial populations were the whole microbial cells (DAPI-stained cell fraction and both bacterial- and archaeal-probes-binding cell fraction), the strain 106 cells (a specific probe-binding cell fraction) and the strain 108 cells (a specific probe-binding fraction) respectively 
he EUB338 (Stahl and Amann, 1991) and the ARC915 (Amann et al., 1990) probes were used for the detection of both bacterial and archaeal populations 
he ribosomal RNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes specifically binding to the 16S rRNAs of strains 106 and 108, respectively, were designed using ARB (Ludwig et al., 2004) based on the multiply aligned sequences including those of strains 106 and 108 
n the in silico analysis, the TF1110 probe was found to have at least three bases of mismatch with any other 16S rRNA sequences and the PB1001 probe also had more than three bases of mismatch with any other 16S rRNA sequences except for the 16S rRNAs of Methanobrevibacter spp. (one mismatch)

train 106 represents typically thin, long spiral cells under the piezophilic growth condition but short bent cells under the non-piezophilic condition 
train 108 is a short, oval rod at any of the growth pressures 
or 50 years, most of the targeted microorganisms have been heterotrophs, while very few piezophilic chemolithoautotrophs were described (Bernhardt et al., 1988; Miller et al., 1988; Kato, 2006; Park et al., 2006) 
his technique was successfully applicable even for the most hyperthermophilic microorganism, Methanopyrus kandleri, which had been also known to be quite hard to cultivate (Takai et al., 2008a) 
his is not only because the in situ hydrostatic pressure is a potential key physical parameter directly  1984 K 
hat is to say, using conventional gas pressures of media, available gaseous substrates dissolved in the liquid phase of microbial medium often become much less abundant as compared with the concentrations in the in situ environments 
n this study, we tried to cultivate H2- and/or sulfuroxidizing chemolithoautotrophs using the piezophilic cultivation technique from a black smoker chimney obtained from the TAG field in the Mid Atlantic Ridge (MAR) 
hese piezophilic chemolithoautotrophs represented the previously uncultivated phylotypes of Proteobacteria 
n addition to the total cell counts in the chimney habitats, the viable counts of the representative cultivated populations in the habitats were also determined under the conventional cultivation conditions 
n the highest dilution culture of a serial dilution experiment using the non-piezophilic MMJHS medium at 50°C, a minor but certain proportion of thin, long spiral cells were observed together with abundant, short rod cells of the Persephonella members 
he partial 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate was 99.8% identical to that of strain 106 
nder the conventional gas pressure condition (0.2 MPa), however, most of the cells became shorter (up to 4 mm long) with motility (Fig. 1B) 
n addition, strain 106 was able to utilize O2 as the electron acceptor but its O2 utilization represented the microaerophilic mode (up to 0.4 mM of dissolved O2 concentration or 5% of O2 partial pressure) (Table 1) 
rowth curves at different temperatures were determined in Piezo-MMJHS medium at pH 6.5 at the optimal pressures 
lthough the piezophilic response in the organotrophic growth of strain 108 was not fully determined, strain 108 was able to grow with the organic substrates under the conventional nonpiezophilic condition (0.1 MPa of air) 
he optimal hydrostatic pressure for the autotrophic growth was equivalent to the in situ pressure of the seafloor at which the TAG hydrothermal field is located 
s mentioned in the previous study for development of this piezophilic cultivation technique (Takai et al., 2008a), it is inevitable that a certain proportion of H2 gas leaks from the piezophilic cultivation syringe during the experiment 
robably, the excess amount of H2 consumption observed was due to the excess amount of H2 leak as compared with the control experiment without the microbial inoculum 
ndeed, the pressure-induced enrichment of the unsaturated fatty acids was identified in our new piezophilic, chemolithoautotrophic bacteria (Table 2) 
his is the first evidence showing that the pressureinduced enrichment of the cellular unsaturated fatty acids was applicable not only to the deep-sea heterotrophic bacteria but also to the deep-sea piezophilic, chemolithoautotrophic bacteria 
he 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain 106 was the most closely related to the sequences of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent gastropod Alviniconcha hessleri gill endosymbiont (94.0%) obtained from the Mariana Trough deep-sea hydrothermal system (Suzuki et al., 2005), while it was distantly related with any of the previously described gammaproteobacterial species of which the most similar sequence was that of Sulfurivirga caldicuralii (90.5%) (Takai et al., 2006b) 
he 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain 108 was distantly related to any of the sequences phylogenetically affiliated with the family Rhodobacteraceae within the Alphaproteobacteria 
he most similar sequence of the previously described species was that of Paracoccus koreensis (93.9%) (La et al., 2005) 
he tree was inferred from 16S rRNA gene sequences using the neighbour-joining method on the 1022 homologous sequence positions for each sequence 
he number at each node represents the bootstrap value (in per cent) determined by 1000 replicates 
he scale bar indicates 5 substitutions per 100 nucleotides.  new thermophilic piezophiles were previously uncultivated phylotypes within the Proteobacteria 
n the other hand, strain 108 was firmly affiliated within the family Rhodobacteraceae of the Alphaproteobacteria (Fig. 5) 
owever, strain 108 was phylogenetically distinctive from any of the previously described genera of the family (Fig. 5) 
ased on the phylogenetic characterization, both strains might represent novel genera of the Proteobacteria 
train 106 is the first fully characterized S-oxidizing chemolithoautotroph of the phylogenetic group within the Gammaproteobacteria consisting only of the thioautotrophic endosymbionts of the deep-sea animals (Fig. 5) 
t is a free-living relative evolutionarily related with the endosymbionts although the growth temperature range is a little different between them 
ased on 16S rRNA gene analysis, the genus Thioprofundum is related to the endosymbionts of the deep-sea animals within the Gammaproteobacteria 
aCl in the concentration range of 1.2–4.2% is an absolute growth requirement; optimum growth occurs at 3% 
he organism was isolated from a black smoker chimney of the TAG field in the MAR 
ased on 16S rRNA gene analysis, the genus Piezobacter is related to members of the family Rhodobacteraceae within the Alphaproteobacteria 
aCl in the concentration range of 1.2–5.4% is an absolute growth requirement; optimum growth occurs at 2% 
his chimney was one of the numerous chimneys comprising so-called ‘the black smoker complex’ in the TAG field (e.g 
he temperature of the black smoker fluid hosted by this chimney (named as Matomo chimney) was measured to be maximally 345°C 
he lid of the sample box was closed immediately after the sampling at the seafloor although the box did not preserve the hydrostatic pressure 
owever, due to the tightly sealed lid, no additional seawater mixing was expected during returning to sea surface 
mmediately after the recovery of the chimney sample onboard, a relatively large piece of structure, which preserved the intact structure as much as possible, was subsampled into the representative microbial habitats as previously described (Takai et al., 2001; 2008b) 
t is known that the hydrothermal fluids emitting from the BSC of the TAG field have one endmember fluid source (Chiba et al., 2001) 
fter the mixture was filtered, each filter was rinsed twice with 2 ml of filter-sterilized PBS 
he filters were examined under epifluorescence using a phasecontrast Olympus BX51 microscope with the Olympus DP71 digital camera system 
he serial dilution culture under the piezophilic condition was conducted twice 
fter 2 weeks of incubation, the possible enrichment was examined by a microscopic observation 
he short, oval rods were also observed in two more dilution steps of culture than the one containing two morphotypes 
hus, the highest dilution of culture of oval rods was further conducted to the extinction–dilution culture for the purification under the same condition 
nder the non-piezophilic culture condition, only the long spiral cells were grown 
he highest dilution obtained from the non-piezophilic cultivation was again applied to the serial dilution cultivation under the piezophilic cultivation condition (36 MPa) 
his procedure provided only the growth of long spiral cells under the high pressure 
he pH of the media was adjusted at 6.5 in advance 
he nearly complete sequences of the 16S rRNA genes from both strains were directly sequenced by both strands using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with a DNA sequencer Model 3100 (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) 
he nearly complete sequences were manually aligned to the representative sequences according to the secondary structures using ARB (Ludwig et al., 2004) 
fter washing with a 0.5 ml of PBS (pH 7.2) twice, the microbial cells were immobilized on a positive charged glass slide 
he slide was examined under an Olympus BX51 epifluorescence microscopy with the Olympus DP71 digital camera system

he dominant  bacterial species in the enrichment cultures were affiliated with Firmicutes members clustering with thermophilic syntrophic bacteria of the genera Moorella sp. and Gelria sp 
lkanes were most likely activated by addition to fumarate and subsequently biodegraded via fatty acids by members of the Firmicutes and Crenarchaeotes into acetate, formate, H2 and CO2 which in turn are consumed by acetoclastic (Methanosarcinales) and hydrogenotrophic (Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales) methanogens into methane 
he presence of abundant members of the Firmicutes (Moorella and Gelria) implicated their roles contributing to anaerobic biodegradation of n-alkanes 
mong other bacterial members in library B1, 16S rRNA gene sequences clustering with members of Thermodesulfobiaceae (OTU B1-B-62, 2 clones) and Leptospiraceae and Bacteroidetes (OTUs B1-B-33 and B1-B-73, 2 clones in total) were also detected.  In contrast to B1, the bacterial community composition in clone library B13 (n = 170 clones) was slightly more diverse with 8 OTUs detected and the estimated coverage of the clone library of 97.6 % indicated adequate sampling of bacterial members in sample B13 (Fig. 4) 
n addition, two clones (2.5 % of total assA genes in library B13) represented by OTU B13-assA-2 and exclusively detected in the n-alkanes-amended methanogenic cultures are close relatives (83 % similarity at the protein level) to the deduced assA1 gene from the  B13 B 72 (74/170, JN836379) B13-B-72 B13-B-103 (1/170, JN836380) B1-B-65 (15/19, JN836375)  96 99  Uncultured Moorella sp. clone LNE-13 (AY531650) 89 Moorella sp. 64_FGQ (GQ872425)  Moorella glycerini JW/AS-Y6 (NR_029198) Thermophilic anaerobic sludge clone C1 (AY526500) Hydrocarbon Metabolism in Oil Sands Tailings clone BTEX1-10F (HM992534) Methanogenic enrichment clone MRE50b24 (AY684084) Thermophilic anaerobic bioreactor clone G55_D25_M_B_F11 (DQ887943)  100  97  B13-B-83 (72/170, JN836381) B13-B-68 (17/170, JN836382) B13 B 27 (1/170 B13-B-27 (1/170, JN836383)  100 77  92 99  90  Thermoanaero obacteraceae  B5  Methanogenic enrichment cloneMRE50b25 (AY684072) Anaerobic digester clone QEDP2DD10 (CU924020)  99  B1-B-33 (1/19, JN836376) 94  100 99  Leptospiraceae  Anaerobic river sediment clone LaC15L128 (EF667524) Uranium contaminated sediments clone FRC-A2_400 (EF508017) Th Thermophilic hili microbial i bi l fuel f l cell ll clone l SHBZ944 (EU639297) Methanongenic community of crude oil-degradation clone L55B-93 (JF947077)  100  Thermodesulfobiaceae  B1-B-62 (2/19, JN836377) 100 Oil contaminated soil of Shengli oilfield clone B312109 (HQ133015)  B13-B-61 (1/170, JN836385)  100  100 Alaskan North Oil Facilities clone PS1SGXI1313 (FJ469327)  Candidate division OP1 Niiboli oilfield clone NRB35 (HM041952) Leaking oil well clone OP1_18_1_D08 (GU120565) 96 Thermotoga hypogea SEBR 7054 (NR_029205) Yabase oil field clone AR80B6 (AB539933) 100 Methanongenic community of crude oil-degradation clone L55B-72 (JF947066) ( , JN836386)) 100 B13-B-100 (3/170, 78 Subsurface crude oil deposit clone SRDP-BD05 (AB546057) Anoxic Lake sediment clone TK-SH11 (DQ463707) Subseafloor sediment clone MD2902-B56 (EU385875) Lake profundal sediment clone c5LKS38 (AM086125)  92 100  B13-B-19 (1/170, JN836384)  95 100  Methanongenic g communityy of crude oil-degradation g clone L35B_38 ((JF946945))  B1-B-73 (1/19, JN836378) 100  123  Anaerobic tank clone BP-B153 (GQ844385) Bacteroidetes Oilfield Bacterium sp

mong the electron acceptors available in petroleum reservoirs, methanogenic degradation of crude oil hydrocarbons within these subsurface ecosystems has recently become an important focus for the microbial conversion of residual oil in reservoirs into natural gas (methane) through biological methanogenesis (Gieg et al. 2008; Jones et al. 2008)

he archaeal community was predominantly represented by members of the phyla Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota 
artial 16S rRNA gene sequences for bacterial and archaeal as well as assA genes fragments obtained in this study were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers JN836375–JN836429 and JN852952–JN852958.  Results Methanogenic activities in alkanes-based enrichment cultures Thermophilic methanogenic activity in enrichment cultures containing production water of a thermophilic oil reservoir was observed with significant amounts of methane produced in headspace during the 749 days of incubation after transferring into fresh culture media supplemented with long chain n-alkanes (Fig. 1) 
he remaining phylotypes, representing 48.9 % of the total archaeal clones in library B1, were assigned to unclassified groups of Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota 
fter another 600 days of incubation (Sample B13, day 749), the archaeal community experienced some changes 
nexpectedly, phylogenetic analysis revealed the dominance of Crenarchaeota-like (52.8 % of the total archaeal clones, 4 OTUs) members mostly affiliated with environmental sequences retrieved from subsurface ecosystems (Duncan et al. 2009; Gihring et al. 2006) or with sequences detected in hydrocarbon-associated methanogenic consortia (Penner and Foght 2010; Siegert et al. 2011) 
mong the Euryarchaeota, archaeal sequences affiliated with the genus Methanothermobacter within the order Methanobacteriales prevailed 
his assumption is supported by the fact that CO2-reducing methanogens (Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales) outnumbered obligate acetoclastic methanogens and represented [80 % of methanogenic archaeal sequences detected in the thermophilic alkanes-amended methanogenic cultures on day 749 (Fig. 7).  n-Alkanes (C15-C20) Fumarate (1) assA (2)  (3) Alkylsuccinates  ?

he size of the gene inserts was checked by PCR using the forward M13F (-47) (50 -CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-30 ) and the reverse RV-M (50 -GAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACA GG-30 ) plasmid specific primers, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis with subsequent ethidium bromide staining 
s depicted in Fig. 8, though alkylsuccinates were not detectable in the enrichment cultures (probably due to the small volume of the cultures available or non accumulation of alkylsuccinates in the methanogenic cultures), the detection of genes encoding the alkylsuccinate synthase alpha-subunit A (assA) in the alkanes-amended methanogenic enrichment cultures indicates that fumarate addition was likely involved in the initial activation of n-alkanes

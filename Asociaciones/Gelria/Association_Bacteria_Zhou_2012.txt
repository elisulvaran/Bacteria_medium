he dominant  bacterial species in the enrichment cultures were affiliated with Firmicutes members clustering with thermophilic syntrophic bacteria of the genera Moorella sp. and Gelria sp 
esults showed the presence of Firmicuteslike sequences (bands 1 and 3) closely affiliated to Moorella and Gelria spp 
he randomly selected sequences of bands indicated by numbers were aligned and showed the presence of Moorella sp., a member of the candidate division OP8 as well as Gelria sp 
he results corresponded to the bacterial phylogenetic tree  obligately syntrophic anaerobe Gelria glutamica 
ptimal temperature of growth for this cultured representative of the genus Gelria is between 50 and 55 °C (Plugge et al. 2002)

o our knowledge, only a few reports have shown the occurrence of Moorella spp. in production water from oil reservoirs (Duncan et al. 2009; Mayumi et al. 2011) whereas Gelria spp. have never been reported 
hese assumptions are consistent with the detection of Moorella spp. as well as the later emergence of Gelria spp. in the alkanes-amended methanogenic enrichment culture 
ur findings are consistent with several reports indicating that alkanes are predominantly degraded to acetate and hydrogen with subsequent syntrophic acetate oxidation to hydrogen and CO2 coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Gieg et al. 2010; Siddique et al. 2011).  123  Gelria 52.9 %  Moorella 44.1 %  B13 (N=170) Anaerobic activation of n-alkanes and putative biochemical degradation pathways There are several possible biochemical activation strategies of n-alkanes under anaerobic conditions 
his assumption is supported by the fact that CO2-reducing methanogens (Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales) outnumbered obligate acetoclastic methanogens and represented [80 % of methanogenic archaeal sequences detected in the thermophilic alkanes-amended methanogenic cultures on day 749 (Fig. 7).  n-Alkanes (C15-C20) Fumarate (1) assA (2)  (3) Alkylsuccinates  ?

t was found that Acidaminobacter at 35 °C Proteiniphilum and Lutispor at 42 °C and Gelria at 55 °C were the main protein fermenting bacteria genera while the carbohydrate fermenting bacteria might belong to the genera of Macellibacteroides and Paludibacter at 35 °C Fronticella at 42 °C and Tepidimicrobium at 55 °C . 1

he main protein fermenting bacteria could be associated with the genera of Acidaminobacter at 35 °C Lutispora and Proteiniphilum at 42 °C and Gelria Tepidimicrobium and Lutispora 2.0 % at 55 °C 
or BH55 dominant bacteria Gelria and Tepidimicrobium that can use both protein and carbohydrate were not found in BH 35 and BH42 implying that thermophilic selected bacteria can exert a strong function in degradation of complex organics 
cidaminobacter and Gelria identiﬁed in the BH35 and BH55 sludge could be syntrophic partners with hydrogen-consuming bacteria 
he bacteria associated with Gelria was reported to co-operate with the hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum to degrade glutamate into propionate H2 NH4 and CO2 and ferment sugars to acetate propionate CO2 and H2 Plugge et al. 2002

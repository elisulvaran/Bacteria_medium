ith the use of Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform, Xie et al. (2016) revealed that the phyla of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes were dominant in the hydrolysis acidiﬁcation reactors treating dyeing wastewater 
he dominant phyla with the BH35 sludge were Bacteroidetes (46.8%), Firmicutes (19.8%), Proteobacteria (14.1%), and Spirochaetes (13.3%) 
imilar to the BH35 sludge, the BH42 sludge contained Bacteroidetes (37.9%), Firmicutes (30.9%), and Proteobacteria (25.2%) 
he dominant phyla in the BH55 sludge were Proteobacteria (47.6%) and Firmicutes (34.0%), plus a signiﬁcant amount of Actinobacteria (5.6%), Tenericutes (4.1%), and Bacteroidetes (4.2%) 
t the phylum level, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria populations increased with the BH temperatures, while Bacteroidetes decreased dramatically at 55 °C (Fig. 4a–c) 
hus, Clostridia was identiﬁed as the dominant class of phylum Firmicutes in the BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge and Bacteroidia as the dominant class of the phylum of Bacteroidetes in the BH35 and BH42 sludge 
he Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis revealed: Bacteroidetes (46.8%), Firmicutes (19.8%), Proteobacteria (14.1%), and Spirochaetes (13.3%) dominated in the BH35 sludge; Bacteroidetes (37.9%), Firmicutes (30.9%), and Proteobacteria (25.2%) dominated in the BH42 sludge, and Proteobacteria (47.6%) and Firmicutes (34.0%) dominated in the BH55 sludge 
t the family level, Methanocorpusculaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, and Methanosarcinaceae accounted for 81%, 14.3% and 2.2% of the archaeal OTUs, respectively, in the BH35 sludge; and Methanobacteriaceae and Methanosarcinaceae accounted for 56.0% and 38.3%, respectively, in the BH42 sludge 
s the temperature increased from 42 °C to 55 °C, the percentage of Methanobacteriaceae increased to 80%, while Methanocorpusculaceae and Methanosarcinaceae were down to 11.6% and 7.0%, respectively 
t the genus level, the predominant archaea grew at BH35 were Methanocorpusculum (81.2%), Methanobrevibacter (7.2%), Methanobacterium (6.8%), and Methanosarcina (1.7%) 
or BH42, the genera of Methanobrevibacter, Methanosarcina, and Methanobacterium increased to 37.9%, 37.2%, and 18.3%, respectively, while the genus of  diﬀerent, reﬂecting the variance in the functional hydrolysis bacteria under diﬀerent hydrolysis temperature conditions. 3.4 
or BH55, Methanothermobacter accounted for 58.0% while the genera of Methanocorpusculum (11.5%), Methanobrevibacter (9.9%), Methanobacterium (11%), and Methanosarcina (7.0%) were largely suppressed 
he bacteria associated with Gelria was reported to co-operate with the hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum to degrade glutamate into propionate, H2, NH4, and CO2 and ferment sugars to acetate, propionate, CO2, and H2 (Plugge et al., 2002) 
verall, Methanocorpusculum ﬂourished at 35 °C; Methanobrevibacter and Methanosarcina well grew at 42 °C; and Methanothermobacter became dominant at 55 °C.  Table 1 Phylogenetic family structures of the RS, BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge (OTUs fraction > 1%) 
n this study, the main hydrogen-consuming bacteria could be hydrogenotrophic methanogens, including Methanocorpusculum in the BH35 sludge, Methanobrevibacter and Methanosarcina in the BH42 sludge, and Methanothermobacter in the BH55 sludge 
he methanogens associated with Methanocorpusculum, Methanobrevibacter and Methanothermobacter were all hydrogenotrophic methanogens that produce methane from CO2 and H2 (Nakamura et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2015), while members of Methanosarcina can use acetate and reduce CO2 with H2 for methane production (Leahy et al., 2017) 
lso, the family Spirochaetaceae that has members to metabolize carbohydrates and amino acids showed a signiﬁcant presence in BH35 sludge but much less in the BH42 and BH55 sludge

hus, the determination of bacterial and archaeal community structures of BH systems would be of great importance for the understanding of microbial syntrophic interactions and process mechanisms of the sludge biological hydrolysis 
he primer pairs of 519F (5′-CAGCCGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 915R (5′-GTGCTCCCCCGCCAATTCCT-3′) were used to amplify the 16S rRNA genes of methanogenic archaeal (Wei et al., 2015) 
he bacterial and archaeal PCR conditions were programmed as: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles for bacteria or 30 cycles for archaea at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 30 s; with a ﬁnal extension of 72 °C for 5 min 
ll reads of the archaeal communities were merged and trimmed as bacteria 
rchaeal diversities and communities Fig. 5 shows the fractions of various archaeal classes, families, and genera in the BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge 
he class of Methanomicrobia accounted for 84% of the total archaeal OTUs for the BH35 sludge, 40% for the BH42 sludge, and 19% for the BH55 sludge, while Methanobacteria accounted for 14% for the BH35 sludge, 56% for the 506  Bioresource Technology 245 (2017) 502–510  H

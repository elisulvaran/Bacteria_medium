etabolites formed during methanogenic n-alkanes degradation A series of higher alkanoic acids that included tetracosanoic acid (C24), docosanoic acid (C22), eicosanoic acid (C20), octadecanoic acid (C18), palmitic acid (C16), pentadecanoic acid (C15), tetradecanoic acid (C14), dodecanoic acid (C12), undecylic acid (C11), capric acid (C10), nonanoic acid (C9) and octanoic acid (C8) were detected with concentrations ranging from 0.69 to 82.67 lM in the enrichment cultures of the alkanes-amended 
n addition, a dicarboxylic acid referring to as fumarate was detected 
he absence of stop codons suggests that the deduced amino acid products are partial sequence of the functional Ass proteins 
his assumption is supported by the fact that CO2-reducing methanogens (Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales) outnumbered obligate acetoclastic methanogens and represented [80 % of methanogenic archaeal sequences detected in the thermophilic alkanes-amended methanogenic cultures on day 749 (Fig. 7).  n-Alkanes (C15-C20) Fumarate (1) assA (2)  (3) Alkylsuccinates  ?

hemical analyses of methanogenic enrichment cultures Methane and hydrogen gases in the headspace of serum bottles were monitored periodically by injecting 200 ll of the headspace gas into GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a packed 1.5 m stainless steel column filled with 5 Å carbon molecular sieves as previously described (Wang et al. 2011) 
he overall biodegradation process is thermodynamically feasible only when methanogenic precursors, namely formate, acetate and hydrogen gas, are completely removed or maintain at very low concentration by methanogens or sulfidogens 
ur findings are consistent with several reports indicating that alkanes are predominantly degraded to acetate and hydrogen with subsequent syntrophic acetate oxidation to hydrogen and CO2 coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Gieg et al. 2010; Siddique et al. 2011).  123  Gelria 52.9 %  Moorella 44.1 %  B13 (N=170) Anaerobic activation of n-alkanes and putative biochemical degradation pathways There are several possible biochemical activation strategies of n-alkanes under anaerobic conditions 
here are several routes whereby n-alkanes are converted to methane; with the predominant occurrence of the MADCOR (methanogenic alkanes degradation dominated by CO2 reduction) process in petroleum reservoirs (Dolfing et al. 2008; Jones et al. 2008) 
lkanes were most likely activated by addition to fumarate and subsequently biodegraded via fatty acids by members of the Firmicutes and Crenarchaeotes into acetate, formate, H2 and CO2 which in turn are consumed by acetoclastic (Methanosarcinales) and hydrogenotrophic (Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales) methanogens into methane

n the present study, a methanogenic consortium enriched from high-temperature oil reservoir production water and incubated at 55 °C with a mixture of long chain n-alkanes (C15–C20) as the sole carbon and energy sources was characterized 
C–MS analysis confirmed the presence of putative downstream metabolites probably from the anaerobic biodegradation of n-alkanes and indicating an incomplete conversion of the n-alkanes to methane 
oth 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and DGGE profiles showed that alkanes-degrading community was dynamic during incubation 
he dominant  bacterial species in the enrichment cultures were affiliated with Firmicutes members clustering with thermophilic syntrophic bacteria of the genera Moorella sp. and Gelria sp 
ther represented within the bacterial community were members of the Leptospiraceae, Thermodesulfobiaceae, Thermotogaceae, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes and Candidate Division OP1 
he archaeal community was predominantly represented by members of the phyla Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota 
orresponding sequences within the Euryarchaeota were associated with methanogens clustering with orders Methanomicrobiales, Methanosarcinales and Methanobacteriales 
ur results indicate that n-alkanes are converted to methane slowly by a microbial community enriched from oilfield production water and fumarate addition is most likely the initial activation step of n-alkanes degradation under thermophilic methanogenic conditions.

nformation about microbial communities and the biochemical pathways involved for alkanes-degrading consortium under thermophilic methanogenic conditions is rather scarce (Gieg et al. 2010). n-Alkanes, a main constituent of petroleum, are biodegraded under methanogenic conditions via syntrophic processes involving both bacteria and archaea 
owever, detection of alkylsuccinates in n-alkanes-degrading methanogenic enrichments can be a challenge because of their transient nature and very low concentrations 
n the present work, an attempt was made by utilizing oil reservoir production water as inoculums to enrich a hightemperature n-alkanes-degrading methanogenic consortium in order to investigate the microbial community dynamics and the possible biochemical activation mechanisms. 16S rRNA gene-based clone libraries, DGGE and functional genes (assA) were used to reveal the community dynamics over the long-term incubation 
oreover, the recovery of a new assA gene sequence indicated that the n-alkanesdegrading methanogenic enrichment may contain new microbial species.  Materials and methods Preparation of methanogenic enrichment cultures Production water from oil producing well at Shengli oilfield of P.R

hese bottles were then flushed with the pure N2 again to remove the methane produced in the headspace; and alkanes-based methanogenic enrichment cultures were then established by transferring 5 ml of the primary incubation culture mentioned above into 120 ml serum bottles, that had been flushed with O2-free N2 (99.99 %), containing each 45 ml mineral salt medium (Wang et al. 2011)

Results Methanogenic activities in alkanes-based enrichment cultures Thermophilic methanogenic activity in enrichment cultures containing production water of a thermophilic oil reservoir was observed with significant amounts of methane produced in headspace during the 749 days of incubation after transferring into fresh culture media supplemented with long chain n-alkanes (Fig. 1) 
ased on the amount of n-alkanes consumption, about 828.91 lmol of methane should have been theoretically produced as estimated from stoichiometric equations (Symons and Buswell 1933; Zengler et al. 1999) 
hese compounds might represent downstream metabolites of the initial activation and fermentation of n-alkanes (Mbadinga et al. 2011; Zhou et al. 2011)

hese clones were clustered into 16 OTUs at 97 % similarity cut-off and rarefaction analysis indicated that the estimated coverage of the clone library was 91.1 % (Fig. 2) 
hylogenetic analysis revealed that approximately 45.6 % of the clones in this library were affiliated with the order Methanosarcinales, which is known as a group harboring both acetotrophic and methylotrophic methanogens (Kendall and Boone 2006) 
n the present case, methylotrophic methanogens represented by OTUs B1-A-103, B1-A-41 and B1-A-64 and closely related (95–99 % similarities) to the genus Methanomethylovorans prevailed 
hylotypes clustering with the orders Methanobacteriales and Methanomicrobiales were detected in relatively low abundance 
hou et al.  can produce methane by CO2-reduction or alternatively from formate (Bonin and Boone 2006; Garcia et al. 2006) 
he remaining phylotypes, representing 48.9 % of the total archaeal clones in library B1, were assigned to unclassified groups of Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota 
ost clones in these groups were related to environmental 16S rRNA gene sequences from oil reservoirs and hydrocarbons contaminated ecosystems (Fig. 2) 
 total of 89 clones were sequenced and clustered into 13 OTUs at 97 % similarity cut-off and rarefaction analysis indicated that the estimated coverage of the clone library was 95.5 % (Fig. 2) 
nexpectedly, phylogenetic analysis revealed the dominance of Crenarchaeota-like (52.8 % of the total archaeal clones, 4 OTUs) members mostly affiliated with environmental sequences retrieved from subsurface ecosystems (Duncan et al. 2009; Gihring et al. 2006) or with sequences detected in hydrocarbon-associated methanogenic consortia (Penner and Foght 2010; Siegert et al. 2011) 
he phylum Euryarchaeota was essentially represented by methanogens clustering with the orders Methanosarcinales (2 phylotypes; 9.0 %), Methanobacteriales (4 phylotypes, 31.5 %) and Methanomicrobiales (2 phylotypes; 5.6 %) in addition to the presence of a single phylotype belonging to the order Halobacteriales 
acterial community and composition Bacterial community changes were first elucidated by means of PCR-DGGE approach (Fig. 3)

ollowing changes observed from the DGGE profiling (Fig. 3), bacterial community compositions were assessed by means of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries focused on samples B1 and B13 collected at days 154 and 749, respectively 
ithin B1, 19 clones were sequenced and clustered into 4 bacterial OTUs and the estimated coverage of 89.5 % indicated that the bacterial composition needed more sampling for higher coverage (Fig. 4)

mong other bacterial members in library B1, 16S rRNA gene sequences clustering with members of Thermodesulfobiaceae (OTU B1-B-62, 2 clones) and Leptospiraceae and Bacteroidetes (OTUs B1-B-33 and B1-B-73, 2 clones in total) were also detected.  In contrast to B1, the bacterial community composition in clone library B13 (n = 170 clones) was slightly more diverse with 8 OTUs detected and the estimated coverage of the clone library of 97.6 % indicated adequate sampling of bacterial members in sample B13 (Fig. 4) 
he B13 library was dominated by Firmicutes-like members; among which OTUs B13-B-83, B13-B-68 and B13-B-27 representing 90 clones (52.9 % of total bacterial clones within B13) showing high identity with the thermophilic,  123  1686 B13  2  1  all together representing 5 clones (3.0 % of total bacterial clones within library B13).

ptimal temperature of growth for this cultured representative of the genus Gelria is between 50 and 55 °C (Plugge et al. 2002) 
he second dominant bacterial members were represented by phylotypes OTUs B13-B-72 and B13-B-103 (44.1 % of total bacterial clones within B13, 75 clones) sharing close similarities with members of the genus Moorella 
 total of 80 clones retrieved from library B13 were sequenced and clustered into 2 OTUs (Fig. 5) 
TU B13-assA-1 representing 78 clones (97.5 % of total assA genes in library B13) was 77 % similar at the protein level to deduced reference assA genes from the Syntrophobacteraceae, alkanes-degrader Desulfoglaeba alkanexedens ALDC (Davidova et al. 2006) and methanogenic paraffin degrading enrichment culture (Callaghan et al. 2010)

Discussion Partial conversion of n-alkanes to methane Anaerobic degradation of n-alkanes has been reported in enriched cultures from near surface sediments (Zengler et al. 1999) 
t is generally accepted that methanogenic degradation of alkanes is a slow process resulting in slow growth and low conversion rates due to substrate activation and syntrophic metabolism 
his might be caused by potential losses of methane during repeated samplings and the utilization of organic carbon for cellular synthesis 
he only phylotype present in substantial proportions in both the earlier and the later settings was Moorella sp 
ther sequences retrieved from day 749 were very different and form clusters with Gelria, Thermotogaceae, Chloroflexi, and OP1 (Fig. 6) 
owever, there are reports showing that methanogenic biodegradation of alkanes or crude oil alkanes involve acetogenic bacteria, syntrophs and methanogens (Jones et al. 2008; Zengler et al. 1999) 
sing the classifier tool of the RDP Release 10 (Cole et al. 2009), most of the Crenarchaeota-like sequences identified in our thermophilic alkanes-based methanogenic enrichment cultures appear to be related to members of the class Thermoprotei; but represented by low similarities to known cultured species.  123  1688 Fig. 6 Dynamic changes of bacterial community composition in the alkanesamended methanogenic enrichment cultures on days 154 and 749  L 
urther degradation of alkylsuccinates will result in the formation of branched and linear fatty acids (Callaghan et al. 2012) 
owever, alkylsuccinates and other branched fatty acids were not detectable in the alkanes-based methanogenic enrichment cultures of this study, while a series of linear fatty acids representing possible downstream metabolites of alkylsuccinates were detected 
he presence of abundant members of the Firmicutes (Moorella and Gelria) implicated their roles contributing to anaerobic biodegradation of n-alkanes 
he current study offers further information on our understanding of the methanogenic biodegradation biochemical processes and functional microorganisms involved in the anaerobic degradation of alkanes in subsurface petroleum reservoirs

mong the electron acceptors available in petroleum reservoirs, methanogenic degradation of crude oil hydrocarbons within these subsurface ecosystems has recently become an important focus for the microbial conversion of residual oil in reservoirs into natural gas (methane) through biological methanogenesis (Gieg et al. 2008; Jones et al. 2008) 
ndeed, these oil-rich environments represent a significant resource of hydrocarbons for bioconversion by the methanogenic populations 
n the biodegradation process, n-alkanes can be initially activated by different strategies, including fumarate addition, carboxylation, or alternative mechanisms (Mbadinga et al. 2011) 
lternatively, gene encoding the alkylsuccinate synthase a-subunit (assA) can serve as a useful biomarker to track for the presence of functional anaerobic n-alkanes-degrading members (Callaghan et al. 2010) 
ll incubations including the background controls (without n-alkanes) were prepared in the same way in triplicate

he classifier tool of the Ribosomal Database Project II (Wang et al. 2007) was used to classify each 16S rRNA gene sequence

ootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates was applied to assign confidence levels to the nodes in the trees 
terile controls did not show any evidence of gas formation throughout the incubation 
C–MS analysis of enrichment cultures medium showed that approximately 83 % n-alkanes were transformed during the 749 days of incubation compared with the sterile controls 
owever, approximately 141.47 lmol of methane; corresponding to 17 % of the theoretical value, were obtained in the bottles headspace 
olatile fatty acids (C1–C4) with concentrations ranging from 1.38 to 72.32 lM were also detected in the enrichment cultures 
he detection of these metabolic intermediates provided strong chemical evidences on the incomplete conversion of substrate n-alkanes to methane

hough higher amounts of methane were detected in the n-alkanes-amended methanogenic cultures in comparison to the background controls, stoichiometric estimation indicated only 17 % of the theoretically predicted methane production on day 749 of incubation 
ore importantly, incomplete conversion of n-alkanes to methane should be the most important factor as detection of potential downstream metabolites of the anaerobic degradation of n-alkanes in the enrichment cultures was evident 
he reasons for the accumulation of these metabolites to detectable level are not well understood 
herefore, for  Methanogenic degradation of n-alkanes has been reported before, but the present study was designed to assess dynamic changes of microbial communities during longterm incubation 
onsidering bacterial clone library of the alkanes-based methanogenic enrichment, the earlier phylogenetic profile (day 154) was dominated by Moorella spp., similar to that of the background control OTU B11-B11 (Fig 
n contrast, the bacterial population profile retrieved from the n-alkanes amended methanogenic culture at day 749 was quite different 
o our knowledge, only a few reports have shown the occurrence of Moorella spp. in production water from oil reservoirs (Duncan et al. 2009; Mayumi et al. 2011) whereas Gelria spp. have never been reported 
urthermore, none of the bacterial phylotypes identified are known to degrade nalkanes anaerobically 
hese assumptions are consistent with the detection of Moorella spp. as well as the later emergence of Gelria spp. in the alkanes-amended methanogenic enrichment culture 
n the other hand, with the exception of the phylotype represented by B13-A-4, most of the Crenarchaeota identified in B13 were not detected in B1 (Fig. 2) 
his observation indicates the enrichment of new Crenarchaeota phylotypes following the progressive anaerobic degradation of n-alkanes under thermophilic methanogenic conditions 
herefore, they could have been implicated in the syntrophic conversion of organic carbon to methane 
his assumption is also supported by the low frequency of Crenarchaeota-like sequences in the control incubation OTU B11-A-106 (only one sequence was detected, Fig 
hermotogaceae OP1 1.8 % 0.6 %  Thermodesulfobiaceae 10.5 % Moorella 78.9 %  B1 (N=19) Dynamic changes observed with assA genes suggest that the thermophilic alkanes-amended methanogenic enrichment cultures harbor microorganisms likely involved in the anaerobic degradation of n-alkanes via fumarate addition 
t is important to mention that, in the alkanes-amended methanogenic enrichment culture assA gene with close affiliation to assA1 gene from Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans AK-01 was detected in this study 
owever, 16S rRNA sequences affiliated to members of the Proteobacteria were not found in the methanogenic enrichment cultures 
his has implication for the role played by microorganisms other than Proteobacteria in the thermophilic anaerobic activation of n-alkanes via fumarate addition 
naerobic conversion of n-alkanes to methane requires the close cooperation between metabolically different types of microorganisms 
owever, addition of n-alkanes to the double bond of fumarate appears to be the most widely spread activation strategy 
s depicted in Fig. 8, though alkylsuccinates were not detectable in the enrichment cultures (probably due to the small volume of the cultures available or non accumulation of alkylsuccinates in the methanogenic cultures), the detection of genes encoding the alkylsuccinate synthase alpha-subunit A (assA) in the alkanes-amended methanogenic enrichment cultures indicates that fumarate addition was likely involved in the initial activation of n-alkanes 
herefore, the biochemical degradation pathways that could have been involved in the anaerobic conversion of n-alkanes to methane are proposed in the present work (Fig. 8) 
lso, organisms affiliated to the Crenarchaeotes would have played an important role in the methanogenic conversion of n-alkanes to methane 
t the same time, the accumulation of intermediate metabolites is indicative of a partial conversion of n-alkanes to methane in the current system

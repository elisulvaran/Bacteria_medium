 owever, extremely high levels of tylosin in the antibiotic manufactured wastewater were still compatible with stable performance (Chelliapan et al., 2006), and it was also conﬁrmed that high concentration of amoxicillin was unlikely to create problems in anaerobic reactor (Meng et al., 2015b) 
 or example, according to our previous studies, increasing concentration of amoxicillin from 20 to 200 mg/L in the inﬂuent, Firmicute, Bacteroidetes, Cloacimonetes, Ignavibacteriae and Thermotogae were the most dominant bacterial groups and Methanosaeta was the main compositions of archaea community in amoxicillin manufacture wastewater treatment system (Meng et al., 2015b) 
 nd CFX is one of the most prescribed antibiotics and is produced in great quantities, which concentration is high in synthetic drug-based efﬂuents (Sundararaman, 2009) 
 his study aimed to reveal how the addition of high CFX concentration (simulating CFX manufacture wastewater) into the inﬂuent affected the EGSB reactor run and microbial community structure response in the systems 
 he composition of synthetic wastewater from the fermentation liquor of antibiotics constituted about 6500 mg sCOD/L mainly contained acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate and other main organic pollutants (as STable 1) 
 n the whole operation term, the inﬂuent pH value maintained at 7 ± 0.2 and the HRT was 24 h. 2.2 
 he experimental approach The operation of the two EGSBs included a start-up period of approximately 74 days was fed with fermentation liquor of antibiotic manufacture process without CFX to allow acclimation and establishment of steady-state conditions 
 FX concentration was measured using an HPLC (warers1525-2996-tcm) equipped with a Waters Sunﬁre C18 (5 mm  20 mm  4.6 mm) guard column and a Jasco ProSar/Dynamax UV detector 
 eaks were monitored by UV absorbance at 254 nm and 270 nm with a sensitivity of 0.005 AUFS 
 ampling and DNA extraction Sludge samples were collected at day 0 (inoculated sludge is the same in E1 and E2 reactor, marked S0) and at day 224 in the E1 (marked S1) and E2 (marked S2) reactor 
 he 50 mL reaction solution consisted of 10 ng of the extracted DNA template, 2.5 U of Plantium® Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, USA), 5 mL of the supplied 10  TAP buffer (Takara, China), 0.5 mL of dNTPs (10 mM), and 0.5 mL of the combined forward and reverse primers 
 he PCR proceeded under the following conditions: 94  C for 3 min; 5 cycles of 94  C for 30 s, 45  C for 20 s, and 65  C for 30 s; 20 cycles of 94  C for 20 s, 55  C for 20 s, and 72  C for 30 s; followed by a ﬁnal extension at 72  C for 5 min 
 tatistical analysis The conversion percent of CFX by-products was standardized to further analysis using the formula, Z ¼ X/Y, where X is relative concentration of CFX by-products in the efﬂuent (Calibration curve of CFX was applied in CFX by-products calculation), and Y is the CFX concentration in the inﬂuent 
 t the very beginning, during the days 0e74, the two EGSB systems both run without CFX, and they exhibited parallel stable sCOD removal ability, with an average efﬂuent sCOD of 903.49 ± 42 mg/L, which corresponded to sCOD removal efﬁciency of around 85% 
 erformance of the EGSB reactor for the removal of COD from the day 0e224 in the E1 and E2 reactor.  218  L.-W 
 owever, sCOD removal ability began to recover from the day 122 in E1 system, and about 28 days later, sCOD removal almost recovered to the same level with E2 system 
 hen treating amoxicillin manufacture wastewater, the microorganisms activity restrained by amoxicillin can be recovered and adapt high concentration amoxicillin condition step by step in the system (Meng et al., 2015b) 
 s shown in SFig. 2-A, sCOD of E2 efﬂuent kept relative stable, and TVFA slightly accumulated in the early operation and all degraded few days later 
 FAs proﬁle in the inﬂuent and efﬂuent of E1 and E2 from the day 68 to 224d.  3.1.3 
 FX removal and by-products accumulation in the E1 reactor The removal efﬁciency of CFX reached to 99% through degradation or conversion into its by-products and the efﬂuent concentration of CFX was around 0.2 mg/L in E1 as shown in Fig. 3-A 
 rom the days 74e116 the D-1 and D-2 had obvious accumulation and the highest conversion percent could reach to 0.05 and 0.13, respectively 
 dditionally, D-3 was accumulated after the day 94, and had obvious increase trendy after the day130 
 nd, in the study, it was found that D-1, D-2 and D-3 were negative correlation with sCOD removal efﬁciency as shown in Table 1 from the days 75e116, especially D-1 (R ¼ 0.799, P ¼ 0.000 (<0.01)) 
 elative abundance was deﬁned as the number of sequences afﬁliated with that taxon divided by the total number of sequences per sample.  most dominant classiﬁed subgroup was b-Proteobacteria, d-Proteobacteria, and g-Proteobacteria. g-Proteobacteria decreased to 2.52% and 4.66% in S1 and S2 respectively, and b-Proteobacteria was decreased to 1.67% in S1 
 listipes (3.42% in the S1) could be detected in most hospital efﬂuent and wastewater treatment plant samples and presented stronger correlation with the variation of the concentration of some antibiotics (include penicillin G) (Varela et al., 2014) 
 nﬂuence of the amoxicillin concentration on organics removal and microbial community structure in an anaerobic EGSB reactor treating with antibiotic wastewater 
 hen the concentration of CFX in E1 reactor inﬂuent kept around 200 mg/L through successive phases, in order to observe long-term effect of CFX on the performance of EGSB 
 uantiﬁcation of CFX was obtained by comparison to the external standard peak height ratios as a function of concentration 
 uring the days of 0e224, the concentration of sCOD in the inﬂuent was all controlled around 6500 mg/L 
 n the day 75, CFX was introduced into E1 system,  2.6 
 s what is shown in Fig. 1, in E1 system, sCOD concentration in the efﬂuent continuously increased to 3919.47 mg/L from the days 75e116 
 nd the copy ratio of archaea/bacteria reached to 0.28, even under high concentration of CFX condition 
 elative abundance was deﬁned as the number of sequences afﬁliated with that taxon divided by the total number of sequences per sample.  222  L.-W 
 elative abundance was deﬁned as the number of sequences afﬁliated with that taxon divided by the total number of sequences per sample.  s, G., Tindall, B.J., Ve ronique, B., Denis, B., Christian, J., 2005 
 revious study also showed Ascomycota is an important player in pollutant removal under high concentration level of antibiotic (Deng et al., 2012) 
 he result was different to our previous study that growth of Methanosaeta was inhabited by high concentration of amoxicillin (Meng et al., 2015b)

 owever extremely high levels of tylosin in the antibiotic manufactured wastewater were still compatible with stable performance Chelliapan et al. 2006 and it was also conﬁrmed that high concentration of amoxicillin was unlikely to create problems in anaerobic reactor Meng et al. , 2015b 
 or example according to our previous studies increasing concentration of amoxicillin from 20 to 200 mg/L in the inﬂuent Firmicute Bacteroidetes Cloacimonetes Ignavibacteriae and Thermotogae were the most dominant bacterial groups and Methanosaeta was the main compositions of archaea community in amoxicillin manufacture wastewater treatment system Meng et al. 2015b 
 esides pervious research found the fungal carbon-degrading gene groups were signiﬁcantly correlated with the oxytetracycline and penicillin concentration and the role of fungal functional genes was enhanced by antibiotics Zhang et al. 2013 
 nd CFX is one of the most prescribed antibiotics and is produced in great quantities which concentration is high in synthetic drug-based efﬂuents Sundararaman 2009 
 his study aimed to reveal how the addition of high CFX concentration simulating CFX manufacture wastewater into the inﬂuent affected the EGSB reactor run and microbial community structure response in the systems 
 he composition of synthetic wastewater from the fermentation liquor of antibiotics constituted about 6500 mg sCOD/L mainly contained acetate propionate isobutyrate butyrate isovalerate and other main organic pollutants as STable 1 
 n the whole operation term the inﬂuent pH value maintained at 7 ± 0.2 and the HRT was 24 h. 2.2 
 he experimental approach The operation of the two EGSBs included a start-up period of approximately 74 days was fed with fermentation liquor of antibiotic manufacture process without CFX to allow acclimation and establishment of steady-state conditions 
 FX concentration was measured using an HPLC warers1525-2996-tcm equipped with a Waters Sunﬁre C18 5 mm  20 mm  4.6 mm guard column and a Jasco ProSar/Dynamax UV detector 
 eaks were monitored by UV absorbance at 254 nm and 270 nm with a sensitivity of 0.005 AUFS 
 ampling and DNA extraction Sludge samples were collected at day 0 inoculated sludge is the same in E1 and E2 reactor marked S0 and at day 224 in the E1 marked S1 and E2 marked S2 reactor 
 oncentrations and quality of the extracted DNA were checked by spectrophotometric analysis on a NanoDrop ND-2000 Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc USA and electrophoresis on a 1 % weight/volume agarose gel 
 he 50 mL reaction solution consisted of 10 ng of the extracted DNA template 2.5 U of Plantium® Taq DNA polymerase Invitrogen USA 5 mL of the supplied 10  TAP buffer Takara , China , 0.5 mL of dNTPs 10 mM , and 0.5 mL of the combined forward and reverse primers 
 he PCR proceeded under the following conditions 94  C for 3 min 5 cycles of 94  C for 30 s 45  C for 20 s and 65  C for 30 s 20 cycles of 94  C for 20 s 55  C for 20 s and 72  C for 30 s followed by a ﬁnal extension at 72  C for 5 min 
 ach sequence was assigned to a taxonomic rank in RDP Classiﬁer version 2.2 http // sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classiﬁer/ and a conﬁdence value of 70 % 
 n the taxonomic ranking of families with relative abundances of > 1 % the unclassiﬁed sequences were picked and grouped into OTUs with 97 % identity 
 tatistical analysis The conversion percent of CFX by-products was standardized to further analysis using the formula Z ¼ X/Y where X is relative concentration of CFX by-products in the efﬂuent Calibration curve of CFX was applied in CFX by-products calculation , and Y is the CFX concentration in the inﬂuent 
 t the very beginning during the days 0e74 the two EGSB systems both run without CFX and they exhibited parallel stable sCOD removal ability with an average efﬂuent sCOD of 903.49 ± 42 mg/L which corresponded to sCOD removal efﬁciency of around 85 % 
 erformance of the EGSB reactor for the removal of COD from the day 0e224 in the E1 and E2 reactor . 218 L.-W 
 owever sCOD removal ability began to recover from the day 122 in E1 system and about 28 days later sCOD removal almost recovered to the same level with E2 system 
 hen treating amoxicillin manufacture wastewater the microorganisms activity restrained by amoxicillin can be recovered and adapt high concentration amoxicillin condition step by step in the system Meng et al. 2015b 
 s shown in SFig . 2-A sCOD of E2 efﬂuent kept relative stable and TVFA slightly accumulated in the early operation and all degraded few days later

 FX removal and by-products accumulation in the E1 reactor The removal efﬁciency of CFX reached to 99 % through degradation or conversion into its by-products and the efﬂuent concentration of CFX was around 0.2 mg/L in E1 as shown in Fig . 3-A 
 rom the days 74e116 the D-1 and D-2 had obvious accumulation and the highest conversion percent could reach to 0.05 and 0.13 respectively 
 dditionally D-3 was accumulated after the day 94 and had obvious increase trendy after the day130 
 ichness and diversity of microbiological phylotypes By performing the alignment the operational taxonomic units OTUs ( 3 % distance were clustered for the sample S0 S1 and S2 and the results were showed in Table 2 
 nd in the study it was found that D-1 D-2 and D-3 were negative correlation with sCOD removal efﬁciency as shown in Table 1 from the days 75e116 especially D-1 R ¼ 0.799 P ¼ 0.000 < 0.01 ) 
 or Proteobacteria the relative abundance in S1 19.54 % and S2 17.96 % was lower than that in S0 44.82 % 
 pirochaetae showed the highest relative abundance in S2 33.32 % , lower in S1 23.31 % , and the lowest in S0 6.10 % 
 elative abundance was deﬁned as the number of sequences afﬁliated with that taxon divided by the total number of sequences per sample . most dominant classiﬁed subgroup was b-Proteobacteria d-Proteobacteria and g-Proteobacteria . g-Proteobacteria decreased to 2.52 % and 4.66 % in S1 and S2 respectively and b-Proteobacteria was decreased to 1.67 % in S1 
 listipes 3.42 % in the S1 could be detected in most hospital efﬂuent and wastewater treatment plant samples and presented stronger correlation with the variation of the concentration of some antibiotics include penicillin G ( Varela et al. 2014 
 mithella 2.26 % in the S1 and Syntrophobacter 0.40 % in the S1 has been suggested as functional syntrophic benzoate oxidizing bacteria and were described as syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria in partnership with H2/ formate utilizers like Methanospirillum or Methanoculleus together with acetate consumers as Methanosaeta Ariesyady et al. 2007 Narihiro et al. 2015 
 esides a reference species of the genus Spirochaeta 1.60 % in the S1 namely Spirochaeta caldaria sp able to ferment various sugars to organic acids and H2/CO2 Pohlschroeder et al. , 1994 , suggesting that the corresponding bacterial population likely played the major role in sugars fermentation 
 omparison with the S0 22.23 % in the S1 and S2 , the relative abundance of Wohlfahrtiimonas decreased to 1.43 % and 1.33 % respectively 
 he phylum Euryarchaeota covered almost all the archaea population in each sample and relative abundance reached to above 99 % 
 ethanobacterium which is hydrogenotrophic methanogens took great relative abundance in S2 69.29 % and S0 54.78 % as shown in Fig . 5 
 n the contrary hydrogenotrophic Methanospirillum Methanoculleus and Methanolinea were only enriched and accounted for 9.80 % of all methanogen in S1 
 he phylum Ascomycota was the lowest in relative abundance in S0 46.35 % , higher in the S1 92.45 % , and the highest in S2 97.56 % ( Fig . 6-P 
 n generous level the gene Pseudallescheria belonging to Ascomycota were enriched in S1 76.91 % and S2 91.89 % , whereas there was relative low abundance of 33.53 % in S0 Fig . 6-G 
 he other gene Phoma 1.25 % belonging to the phylum Ascomycota only could be detected in the E1 system and has the degradation ability to PPCPs such as the antibiotic sulfonamides in the wastewater 
 he Trichosporon belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota could be detected in the E1 and E2 and their relative abundance were 5.95 % and 0.60 % respectively

 hen the concentration of CFX in E1 reactor inﬂuent kept around 200 mg/L through successive phases in order to observe long-term effect of CFX on the performance of EGSB 
 uantiﬁcation of CFX was obtained by comparison to the external standard peak height ratios as a function of concentration 
 uring the days of 0e224 the concentration of sCOD in the inﬂuent was all controlled around 6500 mg/L 
 n the day 75 CFX was introduced into E1 system 2.6 
 s what is shown in Fig . 1 in E1 system sCOD concentration in the efﬂuent continuously increased to 3919.47 mg/L from the days 75e116 
 n the previous study the same sludge 50 % was inoculated into the anaerobic reactor to treat oxytetracycline production wastewater which was advantage to achieved high organic removal efﬁciency Yi et al. 2017 
 nd the copy ratio of archaea/bacteria reached to 0.28 even under high concentration of CFX condition 
 nd with CFX addition Gelria was almost not been affected in E1 on the contrary it increased from 12.35 % to 15.48 % compared to E2 
 owever being affected by the addition of CFX its relative abundance only was 45.04 % in S1 
 lthough the total relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens was weakened 14.45 % , new genius appeared in E1 system 
 he Methanosaeta which comprises the aceticlastic methanogens can generally be found in the anaerobic process to produce an extensive amount of methane had the higher abundance in the S0 about 20 % than in the S2 only 3.81 % 
 nterestingly the relative abundance of Methanosaeta in S1 reached to 20 %

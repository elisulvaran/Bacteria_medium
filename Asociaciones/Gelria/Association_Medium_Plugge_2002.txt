Keywords : thermophilic bacteria, interspecies hydrogen transfer, obligate syntrophic glutamate oxidation, proline oxidation, propionate formation  INTRODUCTION  Because proteins are encountered in almost every ecosystem, the biodegradation of amino acids is a very important microbial process 
his type of conversion of glutamate is hydrogen independent 
he formation of hydrogen is more likely to occur in methanogenic environments, where hydrogen-scavenging methanogens convert the hydrogen to methane with the concomitant reduction of CO  
owever, in a methanogenic consortium, the hydrogen formed is consumed via interspecies hydrogen transfer and the energy that becomes available from this reaction increases to k79n0 kJ (mol glutamate)−"

ecause strain TGOT had additional loops in several regions of the 16S rDNA, we did the database comparison with the complete sequence of 1725 bp and also with the sequence without the additional loops 
NA isolation, RT–PCR and dot-blot hybridizations

hen Thermanaerovibrio acidamino404  Strain TGOT is the first example of an organism that is unable to form acetate from glutamate and forms mainly propionate 
t is unclear why strain TGOT does not form acetate from glutamate, even though acetate production could be detected after growth on several sugars, lactate and pyruvate 
he formation of traces of succinate during glutamate utilization suggests that direct oxidation takes place via α-ketoglutarate and succinyl-CoA 
his pathway was also suggested to be used in propionate formation in Thermanaerovibrio acidaminovorans and Acidaminobacter hydrogenoformans (Cheng et al., 1992 ; Stams & Hansen, 1984) 
n co-culture with the methanogen Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245, strain TGOT could also grow on Casamino acids, α-ketoglutarate and proline 
roline (18n6 mM) was degraded to propionate (17n3 mM), NH+ (18n2 mM) and H (27n2 mM) and the # calculated from the amount of %hydrogen formed was amount of methane measured 
esulfobacterium vacuolatum (Rees et al., 1998), a versatile amino acid-utilizing sulphate reducer, and Geovibrio ferrireducens (Caccavo et al., 1996), an ironreducing bacterium, can couple the oxidation of proline to sulphate reduction and dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction, respectively 
train TGOT might be able to convert proline to glutamate with the reverse reactions of proline synthesis via glutamate semialdehyde.

train TGOT could grow on glucose between 37 and 60 mC with an optimum at 50–55 mC 
his indicated that the axenic cultures of strain TGOT and strain TPO had the same physiological capabilities as in the original enrichment cultures.  Phylogeny  The nucleotide sequence (1725 bp) of the 16S rDNA of strain TGOT was analysed and it revealed that this organism belongs to the subphylum of Gram-positive, endospore-forming, thermophilic, anaerobic bacteria 
equence alignment revealed that strain TGOT had additional loops in the V1, V7 and V9 helices of the 16S rDNA 
ot-blot hybridizations with specific oligonucleotides against these regions showed no hybridization with 16S rRNA from strain TGOT, Moorella glycerini, Moorella thermoacetica and Escherichia coli 
omparison of the size of the 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA showed that the sizes were respectively 1700 and 1500 bp 
equence analysis showed that strain TGOT is only distantly related to Moorella glycerini and Moorella thermoacetica (Slobodkin et al., 1997 ; Collins et al., 1994), with respective levels of similarity of 92 and 90 % 
 phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of strain TGOT and other related species is depicted in Fig. 4

equence analysis of the 16S rDNA revealed that strain TGOT belongs to the thermophilic, endospore-forming anaerobes, though no close relations were found 
owever, the loops were not found in the 16S rRNA 
he conversion of amino acids in methanogenic environments has been studied over the last 20 years, especially in temperate environments (Barker, 1981 ; Nagase & Matsuo, 1982 ; McInerney, 1989) 
owever, in moderately thermophilic methanogenic environments, the degradation of amino acids has not been studied in detail 
nly a few bacterial species have been described to degrade amino acids under thermophilic conditions (Cheng et al., .................................................................................................................................................  The GenBank accession number for the 16S rDNA sequence of strain TGOT is AF321086.  1992 ; O= rlygsson, 1994 ; Tarlera et al., 1997 ; Plugge et al., 2000) 
n # the presence of methanogens, the free energy available from the overall reactions is higher (Table 1) 
n particular, the exclusive formation of propionate from glutamate is very difficult, since the free energy at 55 mC is only k16n0 kJ (mol glutamate)−" (Table 1) 
arlier research indicated the presence of a propionateforming, obligately syntrophic bacterium in a thermophilic, syntrophic, glutamate-degrading, propionateoxidizing enrichment (Stams et al., 1992) 
rom this mixed culture, we isolated a bacterium that produced propionate as the major product from glutamate, in addition to traces of succinate

hysiological characterization  Strain TGOT was able to grow on glutamate only in the presence of the methanogenic archaeon Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245 
everal thermophilic bacteria are known to utilize glutamate with the concomitant production of H , but these organisms also grow in pure culture on #glutamate 
s a consequence, the organism has to grow in a syntrophic co-culture with a methanogen, since the free energy under standard conditions is only slightly negative (Table 1)

his indicated that the loops were not transcribed from the 16S rDNA to the 16S rRNA of strain TGOT 
his confirms the absence of the loops in the 16S rRNA observed with the dot-blot hybridizations (Fig. 3) 
t is unclear how the transcription of the rRNA is regulated

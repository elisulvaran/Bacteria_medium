(i) The difficult succinate-oxidation step is avoided. (ii) Fumarate could replace methanogens as an apparent electron acceptor in propionate oxidation. (iii) Fumarate in the absence of propionate was fermented to succinate and carbon dioxide 
 icarbonate was determined by the same method as CO2; culture samples (2.5 ml) were injected into closed 18-ml Hungate tubes, and 2.5 ml of 1 M HCl was added to purge the CO2 from the liquid phase

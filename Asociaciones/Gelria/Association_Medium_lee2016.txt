econstruction of genomic information of Atribacteria genotypes suggests that these bacteria can ferment carbohydrate and organic acids to ethanol, acetate, and hydrogen 
his conclusion is consistent with literature reports that Anaerobaculum hydrogeniformans ferments mainly sugars to acetate, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, possibly in syntrophy with HMs [36]

. glutamica is reported to ferment glutamate in syntrophic relationship with Methanobacterium sp., and can solely oxidize sugars to acetate, propionate, H2 and CO2 under thermophilic conditions 
he organic component of the FRW consisted of carbohydrate (35% of volatile solids), protein (34%) and lipid (30%) 
he chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of the anaerobic digestion (AD) system negatively correlated with Na+ (2.9–7.7 g/L) and lipid (3.3–22.8 g/L) concentrations, which varied significantly over the two years 
epidanaerobacter, Anaerobaculum, Defluviitoga, Keratinibaculum, Gelria, Tepidimicrobium, Caldicoprobacter, Bacillus, and Syntrophaceticus were the major bacterial genera, and Methanoculleus and Methanobacterium were the major archaeal genera

ntroduction Food waste is one of the three largest components by weight of the organic waste stream in Korea; 8.4 million tons of food waste and wastewater (14.3% of total organic waste generation) was generated in 2011 [1] 
n Korea, food waste has been selectively collected among household wastes by law since 2003, and > 95% is recycled as animal feed or compost 
uring the recycling process, 3.4 million tons of food waste-recycling wastewater (FRW, also referred to as food waste leachate or food wastewater) have been generated annually, and constituted 41% of the total annual food waste and wastewater generation in 2011 [1] 
ue to the large quantity and the high organic material content, significant environmental effects are anticipated if FRW is released into the ecosystem without adequate treatment 
naerobic digestion (AD) has been considered as a treatment option that can reduce the quantity of organic waste, and simultaneously generate CH4, which can be used as a fuel 
D consists of four sequential biochemical processes: hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis 
rocess imbalance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis may occur (i.e., the total concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) [TVFA] produced by acidogens exceeds the amount of VFAs consumed by methanogens) as a result of hydraulic or organic overloading, the presence of compounds that inhibit anaerobes, or changes in process conditions and influent substrate [3] 
he content of major organic components (i.e., carbohydrate, protein, and lipid) would also affect the stability and efficiency of AD because they are degraded into various metabolites via different biochemical pathways [4] 
RW is reported to contain high contents of lipid (30.5 g/L; 37% of volatile solids (VS)), protein (24.6 g/L; 30% of VS), and Na+ (2.1 g/L for FRW, 6.9 g/L for food waste), so potentially-inhibitory compounds such as long chain fatty acids (specified as lipid), ammonia, and Na+ could be primary concerns in AD of FRW [2,5,6] 
urthermore, in a full-scale AD system, the characteristics of the feedstock can vary unpredictably; such fluctuations may cause imbalance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis, and can change the microbial community structure as well as process stability and performance [7,8] 
n fact, substrate utilizations and inhibitory effects are correlated with growth of specific microorganisms and to specific shifts in the microbial communities during variations of process performance, but the natures and degrees of these correlations remain unknown 
hus, understanding of correlations within and among process variables and microorganisms in a thermophilic AD system would provide new insight into the interactions that affect the stability of the process 
oreover, variations of microbial communities in a full-scale thermophilic AD system treating FRW in the presence of variations in inhibitory effects (e.g., by Na+ and lipid) have not been reported to the best of our knowledge 
orrelations within and among process variables and microbial communities in the AD system were determined using correlation tests and visualized using redundancy analysis. 2 
aterials and methods 2.1 
he digester is a thermophilic (58.5 °C) continuously-stirred tank reactor (CSTR), and so it is abbreviated as TC 
ampling and DNA extraction The organic and inorganic composition of FRW varies widely over seasons [2], so the effects of this variation may affect process variables and microbial communities in the thermophilic AD system treating FRW 
amples were collected from the influent pipe and directly from the digester, and stored in an ice box as soon as possible 
efore extraction of genomic DNA, 200 ll of sample was centrifuged at 16 000 g for 10 min, and 100 ll of the supernatant was decanted 
hen the pellet was washed twice in three steps: (1) the pellet was added with 100 ll of deionized distilled water and resuspended; (2) the suspension was centrifuged; (3) 100 ll of supernatant was decanted 
he pellets including the extracted DNA were eluted with 100 ll of Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and stored at 20 °C until further analyzed. 2.3 
hysicochemical analysis A gas chromatograph (6890 Plus, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) with an HP Innowax capillary column and flame ionization detector was used to measure VFAs and ethanol 
he pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and VS concentrations were determined according to the procedures in Standard Methods [12] 
rotein concentration and total ammonia nitrogen [ammonia] were determined using the Kjeldahl method [12] 
yrosequencing analysis Several fusion primers were designed under the guidance of Macrogen (Seoul, Korea) and synthesized by Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea) 
he fusion primers consisted of adapter A or B and the oligonucleotide for amplifying the target sequence 
he combined primers A-787f (50 -ATTAG ATACC CNGGT AG-30 ) and B-1492r  J 
fter an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed (denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min), followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min 
eads with low nucleotidequality scores (< 20), short sequences (< 270-bp), and potentially-chimeric sequences were discarded and MOTHUR with CD-HIT-OTU was used to cluster the remaining sequences that had P 97% sequence similarity as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) 
eal-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) (LightCycler 480, Roche) was used to quantify the populations (16S rRNA gene copies) of total bacteria and total archaea in the digester 
aqMan probe-primer sets were used: for bacteria, BAC338F (50 -ACTCC TACGG GAGGC AG-30 ), BAC516F (50 -TGCCA GCAGC CGCGG TAATA C-30 ), and BAC805R (50 -GACTA CCAGG GTATC TAATC C-30 ); for archaea, ARC787F (50 -ATTAG ATACC CSBGT AGTCC-30 ), ARC915F (50 -AGGAA TTGGC GGGGG AGCAC-30 ), and ARC1059R (50 -GCCAT GCACC WCCTC T-30 ) [16].  2.5 
orensen (Bray– Curtis) distance is dominantly used for NMS of ecological community data because it provides better sensitivity in heterogeneous data sets and gives less weight to outliers than does Euclidean distance [17] 
rocess variables with p < 0.1 were selected and used as the second matrix to construct a Joint NMS ordination plot 
ach main matrix was processed for ordination such that the stress (< 10) and the instability (< 104) criteria were met [17] 
edundancy analysis (RDA) to visualize the correlations among environmental variables and microbial community structures in two-dimensional space was performed using CANOCO 4.5 (Plant Research International, The Netherlands) 
n this study, the relative abundances of bacterial genera from the 454 pyrosequencing analysis were used as dependent variables, and process variables selected by forward selection (e.g., [lipid], [Na+], [TVFA], and [ammonia] in the digester; lipid removal, COD removal) were used as independent variables 
earson correlation tests were conducted using R software packages with optparse and gclus libraries to quantify correlation coefficients within and among process variables and microbial communities.  293  3 
esults and discussion 3.1 
ariations in process performance along with changes in process variables in a full-scale thermophilic AD system treating FRW Temporal variation and effect of process variables on process performance of the full-scale thermophilic AD system fed with FRW were investigated using the eight seasonal samples 
he two-year averages of the FRW feedstock were 161.5 ± 27.3 g COD/L and 71.4 ± 14.7 g VS/L 
arbohydrate (24.7 ± 14.8 g/ L; 35% of VS), protein (24.3 ± 9.1 g/L; 34%) and lipid (21.3 ± 4.0 g/L; 30%) contributed evenly to the organic contents of the FRW (Fig. 1a) 
he coefficient of variation (CV) was 60% for carbohydrate, 32% for lipid and 32% for protein 
hese variations were higher than those of VS (21%) and COD (17%); i.e., temporal variations in composition exceeded those in total organic concentration 
he high CV of carbohydrate content resulted mainly from relatively lower values of carbohydrate contents in summer samples (17% of VS), TC4 and TC8, compared to spring (29%), fall (34%), and winter (54%) samples. [TVFA] was higher in the summer (19.0 g/L) than in other seasons (7.7– 10.9 g/L) (Fig. 1a) 
ne possible explanation for these opposing trend is that high temperature during summer may have increased microbial acidification of carbohydrate during transport and storage processes 
oor degradation of protein compared to carbohydrate and lipid is often observed in full-scale anaerobic digesters fed with FRW [18], and suggests that FRW may contain high contents of refractory protein 
ipid removal increased as COD removal increased (r = 0.907, p < 0.05), and was more similar to the trend in variation with COD than were carbohydrate and protein removal (Fig. 1); these results suggest that lipid removal could be the main factor that determines COD removal in the TC digester. [Lipid], [Na+], and [ammonia] in the digester can directly influence process performance and microbial communities in an AD system [19]. [Lipid] varied more among samples (CV = 89%), than did [Na+] (36%), or [ammonia] (23%) (Fig. 1c) 
igh [lipid] in the digester can inhibit microorganisms (1) by limiting substrate transfer between the cell and the aqueous phase, or (2) by disrupting cellular homeostasis [20,21] 
or instance, COD removal remained above the average (61%) when [lipid] in the digester was < 5.0 g/L, but decreased drastically to 26–44% when it was > 5.0 g/L (Fig. 1b and c) 
his trend is consistent with a previous study that reported 5 g lipid/L as an inhibition threshold in AD of protein- and lipid-rich organic wastes [23]. [Na+] can inhibit growth of microorganisms if it is high enough to cause dehydration of cells by elevated osmotic pressure [19,24,25] 
C1 = Oct, 2010; TC2 = Jan, 2011; TC3 = Apr, 2011; TC4 = Jul, 2011; TC5 = Oct, 2011; TC6 = Jan, 2011; TC7 = Apr, 2012; TC8 = Jul, 2012.  on methanogens alone or together with syntrophic bacteria, varies widely from 3 g/L to 16 g/L, mainly due to the differences in the degree of acclimation of microbial communities and in the environmental conditions in the AD systems [19,25] 
OD removal decreased significantly when [Na+] in the digester reached 7.1–7.7 g/L (e.g., in TC1, TC3, and TC4); this response is consistent with a previous report that thermophilic AD was severely inhibited by the presence of 7.8 g Na+/ L [26] 
igh [ammonia] can also inhibit methane production by inhibiting methanogens and bacteria; reported IC50 of ammonia for methane production is 1.7 6 [ammonia] 6 14 g/L, depending on inoculum and the environmental conditions in the AD system [19,27] 
either [ammonia] nor [free ammonia] showed significant correlation with any organic removals in this study; i.e., the ranges of [ammonia] and [free ammonia] in the digester (2.0–4.3 g N/L and 0.1–2.0 g N/L, respectively) might not have significantly affected the entire process performance during the two-year operation (Fig. 1c) 
FAs can accumulate when: (1) the influent loading or characteristics are high or vary widely, so that methanogens cannot completely process the VFAs generated by bacteria, (2) compounds (including Na+, lipid, ammonia and increased VFAs themselves) that inhibit methanogens occur in the digester [3,19] 
OD removal decreased as [TVFA] and concentrations of acetate and butyrate increased (r = 0.776, 0.690, 0.833, respectively, all p < 0.1) (Fig. 1d); these results are consistent with previous reports that suggest that the concentrations of VFAs in the digester can be used as an indicator of process instability [3].  3.2 
PCR analysis of total microbial populations To investigate the relationship between variations in microbial population and the perturbations in [Na+] and [lipid], total bacterial and archaeal populations of the eight seasonal samples were quantified using QPCR 
he total population of bacteria was 1.4  1010 ± 1.5  1010 rRNA gene copies/mL, and the total population of archaea was 9.1  107 ± 1.1  108 16S rRNA gene copies/mL (Supplementary Fig. 1), and both were positively correlated with variation in COD removal (r = 0.782, p < 0.05 and r = 0.664, p < 0.1, respectively) but negatively correlated with [Na+] and [lipid] in the digester (Supplementary Fig. 1); the second of these results suggests that high [Na+] and [lipid] inhibited the growth of both bacteria and archaea, and reduced overall process performance. 3.2.1 
eads that shared P 97% similarity in sequences were grouped as OTUs; after this preprocess, 17 073 reads (2 134 ± 783 reads for each sample) remained as rigid reads and were grouped into 116 OTUs for further analysis 
 was 1.00 at the phylum level, 0.83 at the class level, 0.82 at the order level, 0.80 at the family level, and 0.77 at the genus level, but only 0.20 at the species level 
ecause R decreased significantly between phylum and class, and between genus and species, further analysis focused on the phylum and the genus 
he overwhelming dominance of Firmicutes has been commonly reported in labscale [28] and full-scale thermophilic anaerobic digesters [29] 
n this study, of 116 OTUs (i.e., total number of bacterial OTUs found in this study), 90 (78%) were classified into Firmicutes and a large portion of unclassified reads at the class level (92%) belonged to Firmicutes 
his result indicates that Firmicutes was highly diverse and contributed significantly to the decrease in R between the phylum and class levels 
hylum Atribacteria (8% of total unclassified reads at the class level) has no cultivated representatives, and is only found in cultivation-independent genomic analyses such as metagenomic analyses [30] 
esults of various previous metagenomic studies of anaerobes have suggested correlations between process variables (i.e., environmental variables) or process performance and bacteria at the phylum level [8,29,31] 
ne report demonstrated that the types and compositions of substrates fed to the AD systems determined the ratio RFB of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (e.g., high RFB for easilydegradable substrates, low RFB for fibrous substrate) [31] 
n fact, investigation of the correlation between process variables and bacteria communities of AD systems may be inadequate if it is based solely on bacterial data  295  at the phylum level 
his is because bacteria vary greatly in both phenotype and genotype even if they belong to the same phylum; thus, these correlations should be conducted at the finest taxonomic level possible (i.e., genus or species) 
mong these sixteen genera, Tepidanaerobacter, Anaerobaculum, Defluviitoga, Keratinibaculum, Gelria, Tepidimicrobium, Caldicoprobacter, Bacillus, and Syntrophaceticus were dominant (96% of the average abundance of classified bacterial genera and each contributing P 1.0% on average) (Fig. 2a). 454 pyrosequencing of the eight samples yielded 8 130 nonchimeric archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequence reads; 3 822 (478 ± 642 reads per sample) remained as rigid reads and were grouped into nine OTUs for further analysis 
ll (3 822) of the archaeal reads were classified into seven methanogen genera: Methanoculleus (63.7 ± 44.4%), Methanobacterium (30.7 ± 40.2%), Methanolinea (2.2 ± 4.2%), Methanothermobacter (1.6 ± 4.4%), Methanospirillum (0.9 ± 2.2%), Methanogenium (0.9 ± 2.2%), and Methanosaeta (0.1 ± 0.2%) (Fig. 2b) 
emporal variations of genera in (a) bacterial communities, and (b) archaeal communities in the thermophilic CSTR digester fed with food waste-recycling wastewater 
t the genus level, taxonomic resolution was much lower for bacteria (19.6%) than for archaea (100%); the difference may occur because bacteria are more diverse than archaea, so that 16S rRNA based analysis of bacteria is likely to be more vulnerable to limitations in short-read length of 16S rRNA amplicons in 454 pyrosequencing and incomplete 16S rRNA gene databases [32]. 3.3 
he Joint NMS result for bacteria indicated that bacterial community structure dynamically shifted over time, and that all temporal shifts were in different directions; the lack of consistent change suggests that bacterial community structure was influenced more by environmental variations in the digester than by temporal variations (Fig. 3a). [Lipid], [Na+], [TVFA], and [ammonia] in the digester and COD removal had significant effects (p < 0.1) on in bacterial community structures among the samples 
he samples located in the upper half of the NMS (TC1, TC3, TC4) had high [lipid], [Na+], and [TVFA] in the digester and low COD removals compared to the other samples; this result indicates that community structure varied in response to [lipid], [Na+], and [TVFA] in the digester and to COD removal 
he vector to [ammonia] in the digester was at 90° to the vectors to [lipid] and [Na+] in the digester; this means that the effects of [ammonia] are independent of those of [lipid], [Na+]. [TVFA] in the digester showed positive correlation with [lipid] and [Na+], and negative correlation with COD removal; this result agrees well with previous study that suggested that high VFA concentrations in the digester may indicate process instability and inhibition of the AD system [3] 
n the Joint NMS ordination plot based on archaeal OTUs, significant shifts of methanogen community structure occurred three times: TC1 to TC2, TC6 to TC7, and TC7 to TC8 (Fig. 3b) 
he opposite correlations of Methanobacterium and Methanoculleus with [ammonia] (r = 0.829, p < 0.05 and r = 0.874, p < 0.05, respectively) supported this hypothesis 
n this study, [lipid], [Na+], and [TVFA] in the digester (3.3– 22.8 g lipid/L, 2.9–7.7 g Na+/L, 6.7–44.6 g TVFA/L) were important process variables that could affect both total bacterial population (i.e., bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies/L) and bacterial community structure (i.e., relative compositions of bacteria OTUs) 
n contrast, [ammonia] in the digester (2.0–4.3 g N/L; 0.1–2.0 g free ammonia N/L) was the only factor that affected the shifts of archaeal community structures, but it had no significant correlation with COD removal and total bacterial population 
urthermore, the fact that [ammonia] had similar effects on bacterial and archaeal community structures implies that perturbing [ammonia] could cause critical changes in syntrophic consortia (of bacteria and archaea) that perform methanogenesis in the TC digester 
his speculation is supported by the results that [ammonia] in the digester was positively correlated with relative abundances of Tepidanaerobacter (a genus that includes syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria, and that comprised 20.6 ± 15.1% of total bacteria; r = 0.657, p < 0.1) and of Methanobacterium (an HM genus that comprised 30.7 ± 40.2% of total archaea; r = 0.829, p < 0.05). 3.4 
ariations of dominant microbial genera along with process variables RDA was performed to visualize the correlations and the trends among process variables and microbial communities through eight  Fig. 3 
oint NMS ordination plots for TC samples based on Sorensen (Bray–Curtis) distance with relative abundance of (a) bacterial OTUs, and (b) archaeal OTUs 
he correlations were double-checked using Pearson’s correlation coefficient at 90% and 95% confidence intervals (Supplementary Table 1) 
he RDA ordination plot (Fig. 4) had model p < 0.05, which means that the model was statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval, and eigenvalue = 0.55, which means that the independent variables explained 55% of the variance in the response variables 
he genera Tepidanaerobacter and Syntrophaceticus include syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB) such as Tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans and Syntrophaceticus schinkii, which establish syntrophic relationships with HMs [33,34] 
. acetatoxydans was detected in this study; this species can grow in co-culture with HMs including Methanoculleus sp. and Methanobacterium sp., which were dominant methanogens in the TC digester [33,35] 
n this study, the facts that (1) HMs constitute 99.9% in total methanogens, (2) Tepidanaerobacter was the most abundant bacteria genus, and (3) the average abundance of Tepidanaerobacter was twelve times higher than that of Syntrophaceticus, suggest that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis coupled with T. acetatoxydans could be the main metabolic pathway to generate methane by acetate degradation in the TC digester 
he relative abundance of Tepidanaerobacter was correlated positively with the relative abundance of Methanobacterium (r = 0.598) and negatively with the relative abundance of Methanoculleus (r = 0.713, p < 0.05); these opposite relationships suggest that Methanobacterium might be a preferred syntrophic partner in methanogenesis under the ammonia-stressed condition in the TC digester.

ominant bacteria genera (P 1.0% in relative abundance on average) are expressed in bold and underlined. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)  297  Anaerobaculum (19.1%) was the second most-dominant genus, and could significantly contribute to carbohydrate removal (r = 0.692, p < 0.1) in the TC digester (Supplementary Table 1) 
oth wastes included high protein content, so the positive correlation between protein removal and the relative abundance of Defluviitoga (r = 0.685, p < 0.1) in the TC digester (Supplementary Table 1) may not be coincidental 
eratinibaculum (8.1%) was the fourth dominant genus; it includes one known species, Keratinibaculum paraultunense, a thermophilic (55 °C as the optimum), slightly halophilic (2 g NaCl/L as the optimum) bacterium that uses keratins and other proteins [39] 
he relative abundances of Gelria and Syntrophomonas were correlated negatively with [Na+] and [lipid], but positively with COD removal and lipid removal (Fig. 4) 
his suggested that these genera may make critical contribution to lipid or COD removals, but are drastically inhibited by the [Na+] and [lipid] ranges in the TC digester (Fig. 1) 
nhibition of Gelria and Syntrophomonas by [Na+] and [lipid] has not been reported previously, so the contributions of these genera to COD removal or lipid removal were investigated 
revious research also supports the significance contribution of Gelria to production of H2, which may then be utilized by HMs, in a thermophilic AD system to degrade cellulose and microbial protein [41] 
yntrophomonas consists of species known to oxidize long chain fatty acids (i.e., lipid) in syntrophic relationship with methanogens [42]; this relationship is consistent with the positive correlation between lipid removal and the relative abundance of this genus 
aldicoprobacter (2.5%) was the only genus in which the relative abundance was positively correlated with [Na+] in the digester (r = 0.939, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 1); i.e., Caldicoprobacter may be halophilic or halotolerant at least within the ranges of 2.9–7.7 Na+ g/L, and this is consistent with the characteristics of C. faecale (recently reclassified from Acetomicrobium faecale), which is halotolerant (< 50 g NaCl/L) [43] 
ee et al. / Chemical Engineering Journal 300 (2016) 291–299 Table 1 The correlations between three types of diversity (of bacteria and archaea) and process variables in the TC samples 
 positive correlation of the relative abundance of Tepidimicrobium with [TVFA] in the digester has been noted previously, and the presence of this genus is considered an indicator of process acidification [45] 
mong the dominant genera, Tepidanaerobacter, Anaerobaculum, Defluviitoga, Ketarinibaculum, and Tepidimicrobium had no significant correlation with [Na+] or [lipid] in the digester (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 1); therefore variations of [Na+] or [lipid] within the given ranges might do not seem to affect the relative abundances of those genera in bacterial community structures in the TC digester 
owever, [ammonia] was a possible factor to explain variations in these genera: as [ammonia] increased, relative abundances of Tepidanaerobacter, Tepidimicrobium, and Defluviitoga increased, whereas relative abundances of Anaerobaculum and Keratinibaculum decreased (Fig. 4) 
acterial and archaeal diversity indices were separately quantified based on rigid OTUs (P 0.5% relative abundance in one of eight samples) 
n an ecosystem, species richness S represents the number of species present; and evenness E represents their relative abundances 
he Shannon diversity index H, which considers both S and E, is generally used to quantify species diversity of various ecosystems [9,46,47] 
or bacteria, [lipid] in the digester correlated negatively with S, E, and H; i.e., inhibition due to high [lipid] decreased overall bacterial diversity (Table 1) 
emovals of COD, VS, carbohydrate, and lipid positively correlated with H; these trends indicate that increasing the diversity of the bacterial community could stabilize and increase process performance of the AD system 
ll of these results are consistent with previous studies and the general concept in ecology that a high diversity of microorganisms increases the functionality of an ecosystem [9,48] 
t also indicates that bacteria and archaea could have different diversity responses, but not different population size responses, to inhibitory effects in AD systems.  variables were elucidated using biomolecular tools (i.e., QPCR and 454 pyrosequencing) and statistical computations (i.e., NMS, RDA and Pearson correlation test)

(2) Tepidanaerobacter, Anaerobaculum, and Defluviitoga, Keratinibaculum, Gelria, Tepidimicrobium, Caldicoprobacter, Bacillus, and Syntrophaceticus were dominant bacterial genera, and Methanoculleus and Methanobacterium were dominant archaeal genera. (3) Both total bacterial and archaeal populations were positively correlated with COD removal but negatively correlated with [Na+] and [lipid] in the digester 
his result suggests that high [Na+] and [lipid] within the ranges might inhibit the growth of both bacteria and archaea, and reduce COD removal of the AD system. (4) The bacterial community structure could be significantly affected by [Na+], [lipid] and [ammonia] in the digester 
elria and Cardiocoprobacter showed opposite responses to [Na+] and [lipid] in the digester, and may be microbial indicators of process abnormality in thermophilic CSTR AD systems that treat FRW. [Ammonia] in the digester could solely affect both bacterial and archaeal community structures, especially in the dominance and the variations in SAOB (i.e., Tepidanaerobacter) and HMs (i.e., Methanoculleus, Methanobacterium) genera, which were explained by variation in [ammonia]. (5) Bacterial diversity was negatively correlated with [lipid] 
o summarize, high [Na+] > 7 g Na+/L and high [lipid] > 5 g lipid/ L might result in decrease of overall bacteria and archaeal functionalities in the thermophilic AD system; in turn, this repression would reduce COD removal 
oreover, [Na+], [lipid], and [ammonia] were among the key parameters that determine process performance and/or the underpinning microbial communities for thermophilic AD system treating high-strength and complex organic wastewater.  J

n ‘‘in-house” program (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea) was used to remove the adapter sequences from all amplified reads before further analysis 
axonomic classification of the OTUs was performed using the SILVA database

elative abundances of bacterial OTUs or archaeal OTUs obtained by 454 pyrosequencing analysis were used as the data sets 
he statistical significance of the model was tested by Monte Carlo permutation against 999 random datasets 
hese values confirm that the characteristics of the FRW used in this study agreed with the year-round observations as previously reported [2] 
n this study, COD removal efficiency was considered a key parameter in assessment of the process performance of the AD system 
ore carbohydrate (22.3 ± 15.3 g/L; 90% of influent) was degraded than lipid (12.7 ± 5.1 g/L; 60% of influent) or protein (9.4 ± 5.6 g/L; 38% of influent) in the system 
oreover, compared to mesophilic conditions, inhibition of lipids (including long chain fatty acids) is more problematic under thermophilic conditions due to the presence of higher portion of their unionized forms [22] 
n this study, [Lipid] in the digester increased as [lipid] in the influent FRW increased (r = 0.789, p < 0.05); i.e., high [lipid] in the digester may be closely related to high [lipid] in the influent FRW (Fig. 1c) 
OD removal decreased as [lipid] in the digester increased (r = 0.889, p < 0.05); this trend suggests that lipids may inhibit digestion in the digester

n this study, [Na+] in the digester varied from 2.9 g/L to 7.7 g/L; [Na+] in the digester was negatively correlated with COD removal (r = 0.908, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1c) 
n this study, the ratio R of classified reads to total bacterial reads decreased as taxonomic levels of methanogens moved from the phylum to the species 
ll of the bacterial reads (17 073 reads) were classified into one of nine phyla: Firmicutes (66.6 ± 20.1%), Synergistetes  J 
n this study, RFB showed no such a relationship with composition of the substrate fed to the TC digester 
t the genus level, 13 218 reads (77.4% of the total bacterial reads) were classified into 45 genera 
ixteen bacterial genera that showed relative abundance > 0.5% in one of the eight samples were considered high-rank groups: Tepidanaerobacter (20.6 ± 15.1%), Anaerobaculum (19.1 ± 18.6%), Defluviitoga (10.4 ± 8.9%), Keratinibaculum (8.1 ± 8.3%), Gelria (7.9 ± 8.2%), Tepidimicrobium (3.4 ± 5.0%), Caldicoprobacter (2.5 ± 1.2%), Bacillus (1.8 ± 4.4%), Syntrophaceticus (1.7 ± 2.8%), Ruminiclostridium (0.6 ± 1.1%), Lactobacillus (0.4 ± 0.6%), Halocella (0.3 ± 0.3%), Proteiniphilum (0.3 ± 0.6%), Methyloversatilis (0.2 ± 0.3%), Syntrophomonas (0.2 ± 0.2%), Haloplasma (0.1 ± 0.3%) (Fig 2a) 
igh [ammonia] in the TC digester (3.3 ± 0.8 g N/L on average) supports this trend 
ariations in microbial community structures NMS was conducted to visualize the similarity of microbial community structure based on the relative abundances of OTUs across the sample set in the full-scale thermophilic AD system treating FRW (Fig. 3) 
he shifts are mainly explained by shifts of dominant methanogen from Methanoculleus to Methanobacterium (i.e., a negative correlation  between these most-abundant genera, r = 0.971, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2b). [Ammonia] in the digester was a significant process variable (p < 0.1) among process variables to explain variations in archaeal community structures among the samples (Fig. 3b) 
he vector to [ammonia] in the digester points up axis 2; this orientation suggests that [ammonia] could have a significant effect on the significant shifts of archaeal community structures 
hese observations suggest that if specific microorganisms are suppressed by increasing [ammonia], their functions might be replaced by other microorganisms with similar roles without major reduction in overall process performance in this thermophilic AD system, at least within the given ranges of [ammonia]

urthermore, the relative abundance of Tepidanaerobacter increased as [ammonia] increased (r = 0.657, p < 0.1) (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 1); i.e., Tepidanaerobacter was not inhibited by [ammonia] within the range of 2.0–4.3 g N/ L (0.1–2.0 g free ammonia N/L) in the TC digester 
his conclusion is consistent with the previous report that T. acetatoxydans could grow at 0–7 g N/L; whereas Thermacetogenium phaeum, another common thermophilic SAOB, could grow at 0–3 g N/L [35] 
lthough the genus Syntrophaceticus can also grow at high [ammonia] = 6.4 g N/L, it grows optimally in mesophilic conditions (25– 45 °C), so it was uncommon in the TC digester [34] 
naerobaculum was abnormally dominant at TC4 (60.8%) when NaCl concentration was the highest (10.7 g/L) among the samples (Fig. 2a), this response is consistent with the observation that A. hydrogeniformans requires high NaCl concentration (10 g/L) for optimum growth 
efluviitoga (10.4%) was the third dominant genus 
t consists of one known species, Defluviitoga tunisiensis, a thermophilic (55 °C as the optimum), slightly halophilic (5 g NaCl/L as the optimum) sulfur-reducing bacterium isolated from a whey digester [37] 
revious studies reported that the genus Defluviitoga was the most dominant bacterium in thermophilic AD systems fed with proteinrich wastes such as stillage [38] or food waste [9], but the exact roles of this bacteria in those systems were not determined 
o our knowledge, this is the first detection of Keratinibaculum as a dominant bacterium in an AD system; however, the relative abundance of this genus was not significantly correlated with any of the process variables considered in this study 
elria (7.9%) was the fifth dominant genus 
oreover, the relative abundance of Caldicoprobacter was negatively correlated with COD removal (r = 0.918, p < 0.05), so they may indicate abnor-  298  J 
epidimicrobium (3.4%) showed the highest positive correlation with [TVFA] in the digester (r = 0.901, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 1) 
or archaea, [TVFA] in the digester was positively correlated with H; this relationship indicates that process instability could occur as archaeal diversity increased 
his conclusion concurs with a previous report that methanogen diversity increases in the presence of inhibitory effects [49]

RW is a high-strength organic wastewater, that has 48–200 g chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L [2] 
n general, process functionality (and metabolic rate) is higher but microbial diversity is lower in thermophilic AD than in mesophilic AD, so stable operation may be difficult to attain in thermophilic AD systems [9,10] 
he dominance of HMs is generally observed in AD systems that are ammonia-stressed (> 3 g N/L) due to presence of selective inhibition on aceticlastic methanogens [27] 
his relationship is consistent with reports that all species in this genus are acidogens that produce VFAs under thermophilic conditions [44]

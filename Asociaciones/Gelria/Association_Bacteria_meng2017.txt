or the bacterial community Gelria and Syntrophorhabdus which can ferment propionate and other organic pollutants as their substrate were obviously enriched in E1 system 
nd with CFX addition Gelria was almost not been affected in E1 on the contrary it increased from 12.35 % to 15.48 % compared to E2 
he bacterial genera Gelria and Syntrophorhabdus played a key role on the degradation of organic pollutants and hydrogenotrophic methanogens was the main pathway for methane generation in the antibiotic wastewater treatment system 
elria was enriched both in the E1 and E2 system

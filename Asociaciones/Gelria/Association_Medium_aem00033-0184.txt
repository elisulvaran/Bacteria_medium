ossible slow growth of S. wolinii on fumarate could not be demonstrated because of the presence of a Desulfovibrio strain which grew rapidly on fumarate in both the absence and presence of sulfate . Propionate is an important intermediate in the conversion of complex organic carbon to methane and carbon dioxide 
n S. wolinii-M. hungatii culture in which Desulfovibrio strain Gll was present only as a contaminant was obtained by subculturing in propionate-media without sulfate 
he Desulfo vibrio strain was able to degrade fumarate both in the presence and in the absence of sulfate 
n the absence of sulfate strain Gll fermented fumarate to succinate and acetate in the expected stoichiometries whereas in the presence of sulfate results not shown or M. hungatii less succinate and more acetate were formed Table 3

icarbonate 50 mM was replaced by 30 mM sodium phosphate pH 7 , and the gas phase was N2 instead of N2-CO2 
he acid trace element solution contained the following millimolar : FeCl2 7.5 H3B04 1 ZnCl2 0.5 CuCl2 0.1 MnCl2 0.5 CoCl2 0.5 NiCl2 0.1 and HCl 50 
he vitamin solution had the following composition gram per liter : biotin 0.02 niacin 0.2 pyridoxine 0.5 riboflavin 0.1 thiamine 0.2 cyanocobalamin 0.1 p-aminobenzoic acid 0.1 and pantothenic acid 0.1 
rganic acids were measured with an LKB high-performance liquid chromatograph HPLC equipped with a Chrompack organic acid column 30 cm by 6.5 mm 
he carrier gas was nitrogen saturated with formic acid 
ecause propionate oxidation to acetate and carbon dioxide is energetically very unfavorable methanogens or sulfate-reducing bacteria are needed to make propionate oxidation feasible either by hydrogen consumption 1 4 9 10 or by formate consumption 3 25 
hen the different steps of syntrophic propionate oxidation are compared Table 1 , it is obvious that oxidation of succinate to fumarate coupled to hydrogen formation is the most difficult step in propionate oxidation 
ethane and hydrogen levels were measured by GC with a Packard-Becker 417 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and molecular sieve 13 x 60/80 mesh 
he Methanospirillum sp . could be enriched with hydrogen plus carbon dioxide or formate as energy substrates 
hese observations suggested that hydrogen consumption by methanogens can be replaced by addition of fumarate 
ense hydrogen-pregrown cultures of M. hungatii JF-1 DSM 864 and the Methanospirillum sp . were unable to reduce fumarate to succinate with hydrogen or formate as the electron donor in the presence of BrES 
ethanogens were completely removed even after months of incubation methane formation from hydrogen or formate did not occur 
he fumaratedegrading culture fermented fumarate plus propionate to succinate plus acetate in the same fashion as described above for the BrES-inhibited propionate-oxidizing culture and in presence of hydrogen or formate fumarate was stoichiometrically transformed to succinate 
n the presence of hydrogen or formate fumarate was stoichiometrically converted to succinate

p to 15 % of total methanogenesis is derived from the degradation of propionate to acetate and carbon dioxide 10 19 
ecause reducing equivalents are needed for conversion of fumarate to succinate part of the fumarate must have been oxidized to carbon dioxide 
ormation of carbon dioxide was confirmed by using phosphate-buffered media 
he cultures were incubated for 4 weeks at 37째C . b In this culture the Desulfovibrio sp . was still present as a contaminant . propionate-oxidizing culture . i The difficult succinate-oxidation step is avoided . ii Fumarate could replace methanogens as an apparent electron acceptor in propionate oxidation . iii Fumarate in the absence of propionate was fermented to succinate and carbon dioxide 
umarate alone was fermented to succinate and CO2 
xperiments to determine CO2 formation were done with phosphate-buffered media 
icarbonate was determined by the same method as CO2 culture samples 2.5 ml were injected into closed 18-ml Hungate tubes and 2.5 ml of 1 M HCl was added to purge the CO2 from the liquid phase 
n this case we found that 25.2 mmol of fumarate was converted into 19.5 mmol of succinate and 15.5 mmol of CO2 
rom the experiments with labelled propionate it is evident that in media with fumarate plus propionate the following sequence of reactions takes place in the propionate-oxidizing methanogenic culture 3-13C propionate + CO2 -+ 2-13C succinate 1 fumarate > 1 acetate + 2CO2 + 4 H , and 2 fumarate plus 4 [ H -- 2 succinate 
his highly purified culture fermented fumarate to succinate and CO2 according to the sequence 7 fumarate -- 6 succinate + 4CO2 as was also found for some other fumarate-fermenting anaerobes 5 18 
he culture carboxylated propionate to succinate while fumarate was no longer oxidized to CO2 but to acetate 
esides the shift from CO2 to acetate formation from fumarate in the presence of propionate and the simultaneous energy-dependent carboxylation of propionate can be explained satisfactorily only if one bacterial species is involved 
hen the methanogens in a newly enriched propionate-oxidizing methanogenic culture were inhibited by bromoethanesulfonate fumarate could act as an apparent terminal electron acceptor in propionate oxidation . `` 3C-nuclear magnetic resonance experiments showed that propionate was carboxylated to succinate while fumarate was partly oxidized to acetate and partly reduced to succinate 
acteria growing on fumarate were enriched and obtained free of methanogens 
ropionate oxidation is accomplished by obligate syntrophic consortia of proton-reducing acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic bacteria 1 8 10 19 
ecause propionate-oxidizing bacteria can not be grown on propionate in the absence of hydrogenotrophs their biochemical and physiological properties are difficult to assess 
abelling experiments with 13C- and 14C-labelled substrates and enzyme measurements in cell extracts of syntrophic cultures have shown that the methylmalonyl-coenzyme A CoA pathway is involved in propionate oxidation by syntrophic cultures 13-15 17 19 21 
n this route propionyl-CoA methylmalonyl-CoA succinyl-CoA succinate fumarate malate oxaloacetate pyruvate and acetylCoA are intermediates

ethanogenic granular sludge of a bench-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor which had been operated for several months with a mixture of propionate and acetate as feed was used as starting material for the enrichment of propionate-oxidizing bacteria 
he culture was enriched in 1983 and regularly subcultured in media with propionate as the sole substrate 
he propionatedegrading culture mainly consisted of gram-negative short rod-shaped bacteria 1.1 to 1.6 by 1.8 to 2.5 um and a Methanospirillum sp . about 0.8 um in width 
ven after repeated transfer and dilution in fresh media small coccoid bacteria remained present in low numbers less than 1 % 
hese contaminants could be enriched and isolated with yeast extract as a substrate 
east extract was fermented by this organism to acetate isobutyrate butyrate and isovalerate or P-methylbutyrate in a molar ratio of about 20:2:3:6

his methanogen morphologically and physiologically resembled M. hungatii JF-1 DSM 864 
n our media both strains had an absolute requirement for bioTrypticase and growth was stimulated by addition of sodium acetate 2 mM to the media 
he propionate-oxidizing culture converted propionate in the expected stoichiometry 24.1 + 1.0 mol of propionate yielded 23 + 1.8 mol of acetate and 17.3 + 0.7 mol of methane 
he apparent maximum specific growth rate estimated from the increase in acetate concentration in time was between 0.15 and 0.17 day-1 
abelling experiments showed that 3-13Clpropionate was converted to equal amounts of 1-13C1- and 2- 3Clacetate

uccinate was the sole organic end product detected by HPLC and GC methods the detection limit of compounds was about 0.1 mM 
imilar values were found in the presence of BrES and only minor amounts of methane were formed in the absence of BrES 
y repeated transfer and dilution in fumarate media a microscopically homogeneous culture was obtained 
he estimated specific growth rate in media with propionate plus fumarate 20 and 60 mM respectively was about 0.16 day-1 
he effect of fumarate on propionate oxidation by a methanogenic and a sulfidogenic culture with S. wolinu was investigated 
ropionate - and fumarate V degradation and acetate A and succinate A formation by bacteria enriched with fumarate as substrate 
owever fumarate was fermented rapidly to acetate and succinate 
ropionate fumarate and fumarate plus propionate were mainly converted to acetate by this methanogenic propionate-oxidizing culture and methane was produced in the expected amounts results not shown 
hen propionate and fumarate were both present increased numbers of both species were found 
his bacterium lacks an oxaloacetate decarboxylase and therefore it can ferment fumarate only to succinate and acetate when propionate is present as a carboxyl acceptor 
e made use of this property to obtain a culture which was microscopically pure and completely free of methanogens 
hus far we did not succeed because the propionate-oxidizing bacteria failed to grow in solid media and with serial dilutions in liquid media we were not able to get rid of a contaminating fermenting organism with characteristic morphology 
e were able to isolate this contaminant and could show that its metabolism does not interfere with the fumarate and propionate metabolism of the propionateoxidizing bacteria 
ecause this substrate is degraded in syntrophy with hydrogenotrophic bacteria detailed biochemical and physiological studies with these proton-reducing acetogens are not possible the more so because attempts to grow syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria in the absence of methanogens with artificial electron removal systems were not successful 16 
ur earlier findings 12 with a propionate-oxidizing culture enriched by Koch et al . 17 and results presented here with S. wolinii suggest that fumarate utilization is not common among syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria 
n the presence of fumarate this thermophilic culture carboxylated propionate to succinate and oxidized fumarate to acetate in a fashion similar to the culture described here but growth with fumarate alone or propionate oxidation coupled to fumarate reduction was not found 23

herefore the effect of fumarate on propionate oxidation by two different propionate-oxidizing cultures was investigated 
hus far Syntrophobacter wolinii is the only described propionate-oxidizing bacterium which was obtained in a defined coculture with a Desulfovibrio strain 2 
yntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria are highly specialized propionate is thought to be the only substrate for this type of organism 
he carboxylation of propionyl-CoA is coupled to the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate by means of a transcarboxylase 14 15

rowth rates were estimated by monitoring the optical density at 600 nm or product formation of duplicate bottles 
he temperature of the column was maintained at 160 or 180째C 
O2 levels were measured by GC in a fashion similar to that used for the other gases 
n experiments to demonstrate involvement of the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway media contained 20 mM 3-13Cjpropionate or 10 mM 2,3-13C propionate plus 10 mM unlabeled propionate 
he propionate-oxidizing culture originated from the research of Dolfing 7 
hereafter it had been stored for about 2 years at room temperature in the dark before subculturing was continued in 1987 
owever it was unable to grow on propionate succinate malate or fumarate neither in the absence nor in the presence of M. hungatii JF-1 DSM 864 
t is possible that the coccoid bacterium is maintained in the propionate-oxidizing culture by growth on cell lysis prod- APPL

his shows that the methanogens do not shift their metabo- lism from methane formation to fumarate reduction when methanogenesis is inhibited in the propionate-oxidizing culture 
owever when fumarate is present in BrES-inhibited cultures label originating from propionate was mainly recovered in succinate while no label in acetate above the natural occurring background level of 1.1 % was recovered Fig . 2A

he bacteria growing on fumarate resembled the propionate-oxidizing bacteria in the propionate-degrading culture 
owever the average size was somewhat larger 1.3 to 1.8 by 1.8 to 3.8 pm 
he coccoid contaminant remained present in the culture in very low numbers 
ater experiments showed that the lag phase could be shortened considerably by adding 0.1 mM dithionite to the media suggesting that a low redox potential is beneficial for growth 
rowth on fumarate was relatively slow the estimated maximum specific growth rate was about 0.20 day- ' 
he culture which was enriched with fumarate was unable to degrade propionate in the absence of fumarate 
n these experiments it was confirmed that the methanogen alone was not able to degrade propionate 
hese attempts were not successful because the bacteria failed to form colonies 
ddition of yeast extract 0.1 % to the media led to colonies of the contaminant only 
n both cultures Desulfovibrio strain Gll was present either as the hydrogenotroph sulfidogenic culture or as a contaminant methanogenic culture 
ike in the original description of S. wolinii we were unable to get a defined coculture of the proton-reducing acetogen with M. hungatu 2 
he sulfidogenic coculture was unable to degrade propionate in the presence of fumarate in sulfate-free media 
n the methanogenic propionate-oxidizing culture the Desulfovibrio sp . was present only in low cell numbers about 1 % 
his indicates that the two substrates were both degraded to acetate via interspecies electron transfer 
he Desulfovibrio .sp . was enriched in the media with fumarate as the substrate whereas the numbers of S. wolinii increased with propionate as the substrate 
ecause of the fast growth of the Desulfovibrio sp . on fumarate a possible slow conversion of fumarate by S. wolinu could not be assessed 
arboxylation of propionate to succinate is an energy-requiring reaction the AG '' ' is +20.5 kJ/mol 
his propionigenic bacterium contains a propionyl-CoA-oxaloacetate transcarboxylase an enzyme which drives the endergonic carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA by the exergonic decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to pyruvate 
rowth of the propionate-oxidizing culture on fumarate alone was rather unexpected 
n addition the culture oxidized propionate to acetate in the presence of M. hungatii JF-1 DSM 864 , an organism which is unable to metabolize propionate 
he fact that only one morphological type of bacterium was present under either growth condition may indicate that the syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria are involved in all of these reactions

t might be advantageous for syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria to omit succinate oxidation when fumarate is present 
ropionate would then be converted to succinate while fumarate is oxidized to acetate 
n BrES-inhibited propionate-oxidizing cultures 3-13Cjpropionate is randomized to some extent to 2-13CJpropionate while no net degradation of propionate occurred Fig . 2B 
hus propionate is not oxidized to acetate but is solely carboxylated to succinate 
herefore this conversion is possible only if it is coupled to another energy-yielding reaction 
owever direct evidence for this is possible only after a pure culture has been obtained 
t remains to be studied in detail whether fumarate utilization by propionate-oxidizing bacteria is restricted to a few species of syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria 
he mobile phase was 0.01 N H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min 
ropionate was metabolized by these bacteria when either fumarate or Methanospirillum hungatii was added 
his bacterium was also able to grow on glucose or pyruvate 
hen a small inoculum 1 % or less was used cultures had a long lag phase before growth started 
e tried to isolate fumarate-degrading bacteria with fumarate 20 mM or with fumarate 40 mM plus propionate 20 mM in agar media in roll tubes or in agar shake cultures

ossible slow growth of S. wolinii on fumarate could not be demonstrated because of the presence of a Desulfovibrio strain which grew rapidly on fumarate in both the absence and presence of sulfate.  Propionate is an important intermediate in the conversion of complex organic carbon to methane and carbon dioxide 
hus far, Syntrophobacter wolinii is the only described propionate-oxidizing bacterium which was obtained in a defined coculture with a Desulfovibrio strain (2) 
n S. wolinii-M. hungatii culture, in which Desulfovibrio strain Gll was present only as a contaminant, was obtained by subculturing in propionate-media without sulfate 
n both cultures, Desulfovibrio strain Gll was present either as the hydrogenotroph (sulfidogenic culture) or as a contaminant (methanogenic culture)

n the methanogenic propionate-oxidizing culture, the Desulfovibrio sp. was present only in low cell numbers (about 1%) 
he Desulfovibrio .sp. was enriched in the media with fumarate as the substrate, whereas the numbers of S. wolinii increased with propionate as the substrate 
ecause of the fast growth of the Desulfovibrio sp. on fumarate, a possible slow conversion of fumarate by S. wolinu could not be assessed

ougias et al.7 surveyed 80% of all centralized biogas plants in Denmark (i.e., 16 full-scale biogas plants) and reported that foaming incidents occur up to three times per year in most plants and greatly interfere with normal operations 
 rganic loading rate (OLR) over time in three reactors (RA, RB, and RC) treating food waste (FW) under mesophilic temperature (37 °C ± 1 °C); OLR: organic loading rate (black solid lines) in kg VS·m−3·d−1 
 A operated stably at 3.0 kgVS·m−3·d−1 during the first 70 days (acclimation and stable stages) (Fig. 2a) 
 emperature fluctuations (sludge temperature decrease from 37 °C ± 1 °C to 30 °C ± 1 °C) and mixing interruptions were introduced in RA for a 10 h duration on days 71, 72, and 75, and little foam appeared on the reactor surface 
 ntense foam appeared on day 87 and lasted for 43 days 
 he total VFA concentration in the foam layer was much higher than that in the liquid layer during the foaming phase (e.g., 14.28 g·L−1 in the upper foam layer and 12.36 g·L−1 in the lower liquid layer on day 95) 
 igestion efficiency indicators including SMP, SBP, and VSr (a,d,g), and stability indicators including VFA/TA, VFAs (b,e,h), TAN, FAN, and pH (c,f,i) are presented 
 rtner et al.4 reported VFA accumulation prior to foaming in a slaughterhouse waste digester, and VFA concentration maintained a high level of 12.50 g·L−1 during foaming 
 owever, VFAs continued to accumulate, and dense foam formed in this reactor during days 220–233 
 he FW slurry was stored at −18 °C and thawed at 4 °C for 1–2 days prior to use 
 he pH of the FW was 6.31 ± 0.21, total solids (TS) 28.20 ± 3.41%, volatile solids (VS) 26.61 ± 3.25%, VS to TS ratio (VS/TS) 93.61 ± 1.54%, and carbon content to nitrogen ratio (C/N) 14.73 ± 0.34 
 he pH was 7.35 ± 0.13, TS 8.28 ± 0.63%, VS 5.54 ± 0.38%, VS/TS 67.05 ± 2.62%, and C/N 10.06 ± 0.43 
 he pH of inoculum for RB was 7.54 ± 0.11, TS 23.53 ± 0.27%, VS 11.71 ± 0.13%, VS/ TS 49.78 ± 0.14%, and C/N 8.06 ± 0.02 
 he pH was 7.54 ± 0.13, TS 26.15 ± 0.60%, VS 15.95 ± 0.56%, VS/TS 60.97 ± 0.73%, and C/N 10.02 ± 0.15 
 A was a CSTR with a total volume of 50 L and working volume of 30 L 
 emperature fluctuations and stirring interruptions occurred on days 71, 72, and 75, and little foam appeared on the reactor surface 
 B was a PFR with a total volume of 30 L and working volume of 18 L 
 he air outlet clogged because of foaming in RB, and the internal pressure continuously increased, causing the reactor cover to crack on day 214 
 eactor contents were mixed intermittently at 45 rpm (5 min on and 55 min off) with an automatic motorized stirrer 
 or RB and RC, pH was measured using a pH meter every day before feeding 
 iogas production was measured using a wet gas flow meter, and biogas composition was determined every 3 days using a BIOGAS 5000 Portable Biogas Analyser (Geotech, UK) 
 S reduction (VSr) and FAN concentration were calculated according to the method reported in our previous study14 
 pecific biogas production (SBP) and specific methane production (SMP) represent the volume of biogas or methane produced by adding 1 kg of organic matter based on VS content.  Microbial community analyses 
 ll PCR reactions were performed in triplicate 20 μL mixtures containing 4 μL of 5 × FastPfu Buffer, 2 μL of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 0.8 μL of each primer (5 μM), 0.4 μL of FastPfu Polymerase (TransGen AP221-02, TransGen Biotech, China), 0.2 μL of BSA, 10 ng of template DNA, and ddH2O to a final volume of 20 μL 
 CR amplification was performed in GeneAmp 9700 (ABI, USA) under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (95 °C for 30 s), annealing (55 °C for 30 s), extension (72 °C for 45 s), and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min 
 ong-term effect of pH on short-chain fatty acids accumulation and microbial community in sludge fermentation systems 
 uring the perturbation stage, VFAs rapidly accumulated to 4.65 ± 1.52 (s.d.) g·L−1, which was significantly higher than the concentration during the steady stage (p = 0.00) (Fig. 2b) 
 uring the foaming stage, VFAs continually accumulated up to 13.45 ± 4.08 (s.d.) g·L−1 with a maximum concentration of 18.78 g·L−1 
 he VFA build-up reduced the pH to 7.52 ± 0.08 (s.d.), which shifted the TAN equilibrium from predominance of free ammonia to the less inhibitory dissociated form (ammonium ion), leading to a decrease in the inhibition of  SCiEnTifiC RePorts | 7: 13701 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-14258-3  3  www.nature.com/scientificreports/  Figure 3

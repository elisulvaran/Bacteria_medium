he relative abundance of acidproducing bacteria Petrimonas Fastidiosipila etc . and ammonia producers Proteiniphilum Gelria Aminobacterium etc . significantly increased after foaming which explained the rapid accumulation of VFAs and NH4+ after foaming 
imilarly the glutamate-degrading bacterium Gelria increased by 371 % after foaming and can degrade a variety of amino acids and sugars in co-culture with hydrogenotrophic methanogens to yield NH4+ H2 and propionic acid as the main products36 
n addition the relative abundance of acid-producing bacteria Petrimonas Fastidiosipila etc . and ammonia producers Proteiniphilum Gelria Aminobacterium etc . increased after foaming which may help to explaine the rapid accumulation of VFAs and NH4+ after foaming

hey reported that in addition to the well-known foaming bacteria Nocardia and Desulfotomaculum, the relative abundance of several non-filamentous Lactobacillus and Bacillus spp., which produce biosurfactants, and Micrococcus and Streptococcus, which decrease media surface tension, increased significantly after foaming 
cid-producing bacteria, such as Defluviitalea, Anaerosalibacter, Mobilitalea, Fastidiosipila, Guggenheimella, and Bacteroides also remarkably increased in RB after foaming (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table S3)37–41 
epidimicrobium ferriphilum gen nov, sp nov, a novel moderately thermophilic, Fe(III)-reducing bacterium of the order Clostridiales 
embers of the order Corynebacteriales typically contain mycolic acids in their cell walls, and Corynebacterium was no exception, containing short-chain mycolic acids with a length of 22–36 carbon atoms (corynemycolic acids)29 
n addition, Lactobacillus spp. also produces biosurfactants during fermentation (mainly proteinaceous, glycolipidic, glycoproteins, or glycolipopeptides)43,44

A and RB were both predominated by the acetoclastic methanogen Methanosaeta, whereas the mixotrophic methanogen Methanosarcina was the most abundant archaeal genus before foaming in RC 
he predominant methanogens in RA shifted to Methanosarcina after foaming, but Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina remained dominant in RB and RC, respectively 
he predominance of Methanosarcina in RC both before and after foaming was probably due to the accumulation of TAN during the early stages of digestion, which supported proliferation of Methanosarcina before foaming 
orynebacterium is a genus within the family Corynebacteriaceae, classified to the order Corynebacteriales, which includes widely known foaming bacteria such as Gordoniaceae, Nocardiaceae, and Mycobacteriaceae

oeller et al.8 found that high ammonia content in feedstock is a main cause of foaming in biogas plants in Germany.  Microbial community.  To elucidate the changes in microbial community structure before and after foaming, the archaeal and bacterial community compositions in each reactor were characterized using Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing 
s listed in the Supplementary Table S1, Good’s coverage was greater than 0.99 in both bacterial and archaeal communities, suggesting that the sequencing depth could reveal most bacterial and archaeal communities in the samples

hese bacteria can degrade cellulose or hemicellulose polysaccharides to produce acetate and lactate due to its ability to synthesize large extracellular multi-enzyme complexes termed cellulosomes31 
aldicoprobacter, which is able to ferment various saccharides to produce lactate and acetate, increased by 878% (Supplementary Table S2)33 
hang et al.6 observed a similar shift in dominant VFAs in a FW digester, and a severe foaming incident occurred after rapid VFA accumulation (to 20.00 g·L−1)

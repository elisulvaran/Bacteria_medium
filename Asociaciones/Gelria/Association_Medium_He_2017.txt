he main steps were as follows: (i) linking of ‘Y’ adapters; (ii) removal of adapter dimers with beads; (iii) PCR amplification to determine library concentrations; and (iv) generation of single-strand DNA fragments using sodium hydroxide 
embers of this genus can ferment yeast extract, peptone, pyruvate, and L-arginine, yielding NH3 and acetic acid as the main products34 
n addition, the proportions of microbial genera known to contribute to foam formation and stabilization significantly increased in foaming samples, including bacteria containing mycolic acid in cell walls (Actinomyces, Corynebacterium, etc.) and those capable of producing biosurfactants (Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, 060F05-B-SD-P93, etc.) 
MP: specific methane production; SBP: specific biogas production; VSr: volatile solid reduction; VFAs: volatile fatty acids; VFA/TA: the VFA to total alkalinity ratio; TAN: total ammonia nitrogen; FAN: free ammonia nitrogen. indicating that propionic acid substituted for acetate as the dominant VFA (Fig. 2b) 
imilarly, the glutamate-degrading bacterium Gelria increased by 371% after foaming and can degrade a variety of amino acids and sugars in co-culture with hydrogenotrophic methanogens to yield NH4+, H2, and propionic acid as the main products36 
actobacillus, which can ferment various carbohydrates to produce lactic acid as the main fermentation product, increased by 1151% after foaming in RC (Supplementary Table S4)37 
actic acid is widely used as a foaming agent in the food industry15 
or example, EPS-producing 060F05-B-SD-P93 increased in RA; Corynebacterium, which is capable of producing biosurfactant (phospholipids) and containing mycolic acid on its cell walls proliferated in RB; and Lactobacillus, which can synthesize foaming agents (lactate) and large amounts of biosurfactants, increased in RC 
his genus can produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which promote the formation of stable cellular aggregates and facilitate interspecies hydrogen transfer14 
H4+ can form ammonium soaps with long-chain fatty acids (i.e., ionic compounds with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends in solution) and act as surface active material to promote the formation of foam

o identify the causes of foaming, reactor performance and microbial community dynamics were investigated in three mesophilic digesters treating FW 
he digesters were operated under different modes, and foaming was induced with several methods 
roliferation of specific bacteria and accumulation of surface active materials may be the main causes of foaming 
olatile fatty acids (VFAs) and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) accumulated in these reactors before foaming, which may have contributed to foam formation by decreasing the surface tension of sludge and increasing foam stability 
he relative abundance of acidproducing bacteria (Petrimonas, Fastidiosipila, etc.) and ammonia producers (Proteiniphilum, Gelria, Aminobacterium, etc.) significantly increased after foaming, which explained the rapid accumulation of VFAs and NH4+ after foaming 
hese findings improve the understanding of foaming mechanisms in FW digesters and provide a theoretical basis for further research on effective suppression and early warning of foaming 
naerobic digestion is the most feasible method for treating food waste (FW) and recovering renewable energy due to its high organic and moisture contents and low calorific value compared with traditional treatments such as incineration or landfills1 
ougias et al.7 surveyed 80% of all centralized biogas plants in Denmark (i.e., 16 full-scale biogas plants) and reported that foaming incidents occur up to three times per year in most plants and greatly interfere with normal operations 
oeller et al.8 and Subramanian et al.9 reported a similar phenomenon in Germany and America, respectively 
xcessive foam may cause operational problems such as pump clogging and digester breakage, environmental problems due to overflowing sludge, and even financial losses due to reduced biogas production and extra maintenance cost7–9 
hus, studies on the causes of foaming in anaerobic digesters are crucial to provide a theoretical basis for further research on effective foaming suppression and prevention measures 
any studies have suggested that unsuitable or unstable operating conditions such as organic overloading, temperature fluctuation, and inadequate mixing contribute to anaerobic digestion foaming7–11 
ther studies have indicated that excess surface active materials such as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), lipids, proteins, and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) decrease surface tension and enhance foaming potential10,12 
or example, Gordonia and Microthrix sp. have been found to proliferate after foaming events and largely contribute to foaming2,9–11

hey reported that in addition to the well-known foaming bacteria Nocardia and Desulfotomaculum, the relative abundance of several non-filamentous Lactobacillus and Bacillus spp., which produce biosurfactants, and Micrococcus and Streptococcus, which decrease media surface tension, increased significantly after foaming 
s far as we know, most studies have reported only the occurrence of foaming in such systems, whereas few have investigated the changes in microbial communities before and after foaming events or specific microorganisms that cause foaming 
o identify the universal causes of foaming in mesophilic FW digesters, FW fermentation was carried out through wet digestion in a completely stirring tank reactor (CSTR) (RA) and through dry digestion in a plug flow reactor (PFR) (RB) and CSTR (RC) 
oaming was induced in these digesters by temperature fluctuation and mixing interruption (RA), organic overloading (RB), and ammonia inhibition (RC) (Fig. 1) 
o elucidate the factors contributing to foam formation in these three reactors, physicochemical indicators were monitored during fermentation and microbial community structures before and after foaming were investigated using MiSeq high-throughput sequencing technology 
his study provides a theoretical basis for timely foam suppression and effective early warning in anaerobic digesters used to treat FW.  Results and Discussion  Reactor performance 
he digesters were initiated at the same time and acclimated to the same organic loading rate (OLR) of 3.0 kgVS·m−3·d−1 
emperature fluctuation, mixing interruption, and increased OLR were introduced into RA; the OLR in RB was increased with a specific gradient until organic overloading was induced; RC was operated under the initial OLR and experienced ammonia accumulation and inhibition 
fficiency and stability parameters for each reactor were monitored during operation (Fig. 2) 
A operated stably at 3.0 kgVS·m−3·d−1 during the first 70 days (acclimation and stable stages) (Fig. 2a) 
emperature fluctuations (sludge temperature decrease from 37 °C ± 1 °C to 30 °C ± 1 °C) and mixing interruptions were introduced in RA for a 10 h duration on days 71, 72, and 75, and little foam appeared on the reactor surface 
ntense foam appeared on day 87 and lasted for 43 days 
he total VFA concentration in the foam layer was much higher than that in the liquid layer during the foaming phase (e.g., 14.28 g·L−1 in the upper foam layer and 12.36 g·L−1 in the lower liquid layer on day 95) 
erformance parameters for RA (a–c), RB (d–f), and RC (g–i) 
igestion efficiency indicators including SMP, SBP, and VSr (a,d,g), and stability indicators including VFA/TA, VFAs (b,e,h), TAN, FAN, and pH (c,f,i) are presented 
-I to A-V, B-I to B-V, and C-I to C-V respectively represent operation stages for RA, RB, and RC as shown in Fig. 1 
FAs have structures with free polic ends (carboxylic ends) that exhibit surfactant properties; thus, they tend to rise with fine gas bubbles and accumulate at the air–liquid interface 
ccumulated VFAs could decrease the surface tension of digested liquid, increase foaming tendency, and thereby may promote foam formation10,12 
imilarly, accumulation of VFAs was also observed before or during foaming in RB and RC, and VFAs with more carbons such as propionate obviously increased (Fig. 2e,f) 
hang et al.6 observed a similar shift in dominant VFAs in a FW digester, and a severe foaming incident occurred after rapid VFA accumulation (to 20.00 g·L−1) 
rtner et al.4 reported VFA accumulation prior to foaming in a slaughterhouse waste digester, and VFA concentration maintained a high level of 12.50 g·L−1 during foaming 
axonomic compositions (a,c) and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) (b,d) of archaeal and bacterial communities in three digesters 
owever, VFAs continued to accumulate, and dense foam formed in this reactor during days 220–233 
oe et al.12 reported that NH4+ increases foam formation and stability 
oeller et al.8 found that high ammonia content in feedstock is a main cause of foaming in biogas plants in Germany.  Microbial community.  To elucidate the changes in microbial community structure before and after foaming, the archaeal and bacterial community compositions in each reactor were characterized using Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing 
s listed in the Supplementary Table S1, Good’s coverage was greater than 0.99 in both bacterial and archaeal communities, suggesting that the sequencing depth could reveal most bacterial and archaeal communities in the samples 
ifferent methanogens were predominant in the reactors before and after foaming (Fig. 3a) 
A and RB were both predominated by the acetoclastic methanogen Methanosaeta, whereas the mixotrophic methanogen Methanosarcina was the most abundant archaeal genus before foaming in RC 
he predominant methanogens in RA shifted to Methanosarcina after foaming, but Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina remained dominant in RB and RC, respectively 
ethanosarcina was predominant in RA after foaming with high VFA and ammonia accumulation, due to its strong tolerance to high ammonia and VFA concentrations compared with Methanosaeta17,19,20 
ecause the plug flow operation mode of RB protected multicellular aggregates formed by Methanosaeta from shear and turbulence and these aggregates could be used to resist inhibition caused by VFA and TAN, Methanosaeta was able to maintain high relative abundance during the foaming stage19 
he predominance of Methanosarcina in RC both before and after foaming was probably due to the accumulation of TAN during the early stages of digestion, which supported proliferation of Methanosarcina before foaming 
CiEnTifiC RePorts | 7: 13701 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-14258-3  4  www.nature.com/scientificreports/ According to principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), no obvious changes in the archaeal communities of samples from RB or RC were found before and after foaming (Fig. 3b) 
irmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the most common major phyla in the three reactors before foaming, accounting for 56.2% to 89.0% of total sequences (Fig. 3c) 
embers of these two phyla are closely related to hydrolysis and acidification of organic substrates and they have been reported as predominant phyla in other mesophilic anaerobic digesters treating FW13,19,21 
he proportion of another major phylum Bacteroidetes did not obviously change in RC, but substantially increased and decreased in RA and RB, respectively 
oreover, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria obviously increased in the three reactors after foaming, reaching up to 12.17%, 26.03%, and 16.39% in RA, RB, and RC, respectively 
ost members of Actinobacteria have a filamentous structure, which aides in the hydrolysis and acidification processes of anaerobic digestion, and they also are able to metabolize many kinds of substrates, including protein, lipid, lignin, cellulose, sugar, and amino acid22,23 
he lower abundance of Actinobacteria in RA and RC compared with RB may be due to the negative effect of shear and turbulence on the growth of filaments in these two CSTRs 
he relative abundance of Synergistetes increased by 295% and 106% after foaming in RA and RC, respectively 
ts members mainly include anaerobic amino-acid-degrading bacteria and syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria that can be co-cultured with methanogens24 
o evaluate the correlations between these changes and foaming as well as identify specific microorganisms related to foam formation, we further analyzed the changes in bacterial genera after foaming.  Bacterial analysis at the genus level.  The relative abundances of many genera obviously increased after foaming (Supplementary Tables S2–S4; Fig. 4) 
PS consists of organic macromolecules produced extracellularly by microorganisms and has been found in the intracellular space of microbial aggregates 
he main components of EPS such as polysaccharides and proteins can form ionisable compounds with hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends in solution 
herefore, EPS tends to form an organic film at the air–liquid interface, with the hydrophobic end toward the gas phase and the hydrophilic end toward the liquid phase 
his organic film reduces the surface tension of the air–liquid interface and increases the stability of foam10,12 
ollivignarelli et al.25 reported that foam formation in a thermophilic membrane reactor was correlated to the presence of EPS, in particular the soluble protein fraction, which was consistent with the results of Cosenza et al.26 and Di Bella et al.27 
imilar to Gordonia, Microthrix, and other common foam-forming bacteria in activated sludge systems, Actinomyces strains found in the three reactors included filamentous bacteria; the presence of mycolic acids on the cell walls of these bacteria made cells extremely hydrophobic9,10,28,29 
ue to their hydrophobic properties and potential for biosurfactant production, filaments tend to attach to biogas bubbles and accumulate on the air– liquid interface, resulting in lower surface tension of sludge and enhanced foaming15,30 
hese bacteria can degrade cellulose or hemicellulose polysaccharides to produce acetate and lactate due to its ability to synthesize large extracellular multi-enzyme complexes termed cellulosomes31 
aldicoprobacter, which is able to ferment various saccharides to produce lactate and acetate, increased by 878% (Supplementary Table S2)33 
he relative abundance of Petrimonas was highest (29.34%) in foaming samples, and this value was 689% higher than that before foaming 
embers of this genus can hydrolyze many types of carbohydrates and organic acids in the presence of elemental sulfur to produce a large amount of acetic acid34 
he relative abundance of Gallicola, which is able to metabolize peptone and amino acids to NH3, acetic acid, and butyric acid, increased by 456%37 
orynebacterium is a genus within the family Corynebacteriaceae, classified to the order Corynebacteriales, which includes widely known foaming bacteria such as Gordoniaceae, Nocardiaceae, and Mycobacteriaceae 
embers of the order Corynebacteriales typically contain mycolic acids in their cell walls, and Corynebacterium was no exception, containing short-chain mycolic acids with a length of 22–36 carbon atoms (corynemycolic acids)29 
n addition, Petrimonas, Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214, Aminobacterium, and Caldicoprobacter, which significantly increased in RA, respectively increased by 75%, 77%, 696%, and 318% in RB after foaming (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table S3) 
cid-producing bacteria, such as Defluviitalea, Anaerosalibacter, Mobilitalea, Fastidiosipila, Guggenheimella, and Bacteroides also remarkably increased in RB after foaming (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table S3)37–41 
he relative abundances of Tissierella and  SCiEnTifiC RePorts | 7: 13701 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-14258-3  5  www.nature.com/scientificreports/  Figure 4 
elative abundance and statistical analysis of the difference between relative abundances of bacterial communities in RA (a), RB (b), and RC (c) before and after foaming 
nly bacterial genera that significantly increased in abundance after foaming and with relative abundance higher than 0.5% in foaming samples are represented.  Tepidimicrobium, which can metabolize proteins and amino acids, increased by 54% and 441% after foaming, respectively37,42 
uminococcus, which can secrete extracellular enzymes for degradation of cellulose or hemicellulose to produce formic and acetic acid, increased in proportion by 1029% in RC after foaming (Supplementary Table S4)45 
phaerochaeta increased by 110% after foaming, and this genus can ferment carbohydrates to produce acetate, formate, and ethanol46 
inally, Actinomyces, acid-producing bacteria (Mobilitalea, Petrimonas), and ammonia-producing bacteria (Proteiniphilum, Aminobacterium, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214) proliferated in RC after foaming, similar to the trends in RA and RB (Fig. 4c) 
n summary, intense foam was induced in the three FW digesters by different methods including temperature disturbance/mixing interruption, organic overloading, and ammonia inhibition 
xtremely hydrophobic filaments or their products with surface active properties increased foam formation and stability 
n addition, the relative abundance of acid-producing bacteria (Petrimonas, Fastidiosipila, etc.) and ammonia producers (Proteiniphilum, Gelria, Aminobacterium, etc.) increased after foaming, which may help to explaine the rapid accumulation of VFAs and NH4+ after foaming 
s shown previously, high concentrations of VFAs may greatly reduce the surface tension of liquid and increase foaming tendency 
H4+ may promote foam formation and stability as well as inhibit VFA consumption, thereby promoting VFAs accumulation and further strengthening the foaming potential 
herefore, the proliferation of acids and ammonia producers may potentially contribute to foam formation in reactors 
he association between foaming and these specific microorganisms requires to be further investigated 
urther works is needed to investigate the corresponding foaming thresholds of these specific bacteria (e.g., Actinomyces) and evaluate the feasibility of these bacteria as early warning indicators 
his information can help realize effective early warning and control methods for foaming during anaerobic digestion of FW.  Measures for foam prevention and suppression 
ut it can be useful for developing hypotheses that foaming in the mesophilic digesters were likely involved a combination of accumulated surface active materials (such as VFAs and NH4+) and proliferation of specific microorganisms 
ased on the hypotheses, we present recommendations for foam prevention and suppression below 
luctuations in operational conditions (e.g., mixing disturbance and temperature fluctuation), excessive organic loading, and accumulation of inhibitors, which may cause fluctuations in methanogenic activity, must be prevented to avoid VFA accumulation 
or example, Ca2+ and Mg2+ tend to combine with VFAs to form insoluble salts, and therefore decrease the surface active properties of VFAs12 
urthermore, the addition of Ca2+ and Mg2+ can increase the alkalinity in digesters and reduce inhibition on methanogenic bacteria due to acidification 
n addition, reducing the OLR or ceasing feeding for a period of time can limit the production of surfactants (VFAs, NH4+, EPS, etc.) due to the hydrolysis and acidification of new substrate, and thereby ensure full degradation of accumulating surface active materials8 
oreover, reducing the OLR will decrease the substrate available to microbes, which will reduce the propagation of filamentous bacteria and biosurfactant producing bacteria 
inally, to eliminate or reduce the contribution of accumulated NH4+ to foaming, ammonia stripping methods can be considered48.  Materials and Methods  Substrates and inoculum

owever, foaming in anaerobic digesters is a major problem that disrupts the stable operation of biogas plants2–6 
herefore, researchers have begun to analyze the effects of key microorganisms to identify the causes of foaming 
any common filamentous bacteria found in activated sludge are induced by the use of sewage sludge as inoculum or substrate 
owever, the cause of foaming in anaerobic digestion systems that use substances other than sewage sludge as substrate is unclear

owever, because microbial communities are sensitive to operational conditions, the microbial community structure in foaming digesters with different temperatures or substrates may vary from those found in the studies mentioned above13,15 
ue to differences in digester conditions as mentioned above, we could not directly use existing research results to analyze the causes of foaming in mesophilic anaerobic digesters used to treat FW 
peration conditions for the three FW digesters are shown in Fig. 1 
uring the perturbation stage, VFAs rapidly accumulated to 4.65 ± 1.52 (s.d.) g·L−1, which was significantly higher than the concentration during the steady stage (p = 0.00) (Fig. 2b) 
uring the foaming stage, VFAs continually accumulated up to 13.45 ± 4.08 (s.d.) g·L−1 with a maximum concentration of 18.78 g·L−1 
he change in VFA composition may have been due to accumulation of electrons by acidogenic bacteria using VFAs with more carbons (e.g., propionate or n-valerate) after H2 accumulation in the system16 
n addition, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) in the three reactors exhibited sustained accumulation (Fig. 2c,f,i) 
any studies have shown that ammonia accumulation can inhibit process stability, especially the cytotoxic free ammonia nitrogen (FAN), causing cytoplasmic K+ loss via an ammonia/K+ exchange reaction17,18 
n the present study, the gradual accumulation of FAN led to rapid VFA accumulation in RC 
he VFA build-up reduced the pH to 7.52 ± 0.08 (s.d.), which shifted the TAN equilibrium from predominance of free ammonia to the less inhibitory dissociated form (ammonium ion), leading to a decrease in the inhibition of  SCiEnTifiC RePorts | 7: 13701 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-14258-3  3  www.nature.com/scientificreports/  Figure 3 
elative abundance is defined as the number of sequences affiliated with that taxon divided by the total number of sequences per sample (%) 
ifferences in predominant methanogens may be due to variation in reactor configuration or inhibitory substances among the three reactors 
herefore, it is not possible to relate methanogens to foam formation, which supports the results of Kougias et al.15 
n contrast, bacteria played a major role in the formation of foam10,15 
n RA, the relative abundance of 060F05-B-SD-P93 was 180 times higher after foaming than before (Fig. 4a) 
n this study, the relative abundance of Actinomyces increased by 802% after foaming 
herefore, proliferation of Actinomyces was correlated to the formation of foam 
he relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae_NK4A214, a novel rumen bacterium within the family Ruminococcaceae, increased by 3926%32 
n addition to proliferation of Actinomyces after foaming in RB (Fig. 4b), the proportion of Corynebacterium, which belongs to the phylum Actinobacteria, increased by 55% (Supplementary Table S3) 
nd further works with more rigorous experimental designs is needed to verify the hypotheses raised in this study 
nd the prevention of ammonia inhibition can be achieved by adjusting the C:N ratio of feedstock or adding the appropriate amount of trace elements47,48 
hen foaming occurs, a fast-responding defoaming agent can be added to efficiently suppress foam under the condition that the components do not inhibit the anaerobic digestion process or adversely affect the environment49 
ncreasing the stirring rate will also disrupt the growth of filamentous bacteria such as Actinomyces

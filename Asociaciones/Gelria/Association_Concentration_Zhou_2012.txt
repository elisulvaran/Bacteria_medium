his assumption is supported by the fact that CO2-reducing methanogens (Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales) outnumbered obligate acetoclastic methanogens and represented [80 % of methanogenic archaeal sequences detected in the thermophilic alkanes-amended methanogenic cultures on day 749 (Fig. 7).  n-Alkanes (C15-C20) Fumarate (1) assA (2)  (3) Alkylsuccinates  ?

 hemical analyses of methanogenic enrichment cultures Methane and hydrogen gases in the headspace of serum bottles were monitored periodically by injecting 200 ll of the headspace gas into GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a packed 1.5 m stainless steel column filled with 5 Å carbon molecular sieves as previously described (Wang et al. 2011) 
 he overall biodegradation process is thermodynamically feasible only when methanogenic precursors, namely formate, acetate and hydrogen gas, are completely removed or maintain at very low concentration by methanogens or sulfidogens 
 ur findings are consistent with several reports indicating that alkanes are predominantly degraded to acetate and hydrogen with subsequent syntrophic acetate oxidation to hydrogen and CO2 coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (Gieg et al. 2010; Siddique et al. 2011).  123  Gelria 52.9 %  Moorella 44.1 %  B13 (N=170) Anaerobic activation of n-alkanes and putative biochemical degradation pathways There are several possible biochemical activation strategies of n-alkanes under anaerobic conditions

 ur results indicate that n-alkanes are converted to methane slowly by a microbial community enriched from oilfield production water and fumarate addition is most likely the initial activation step of n-alkanes degradation under thermophilic methanogenic conditions.

 ifty milliliter of the oil reservoir fluid were transferred aseptically into each 120 ml sterile serum bottle and flushed with O2-free N2 (99.99 %) after passing through heated copper filings 
 fter flushed with N2, the serum bottles were capped with butyl rubber stoppers (Bellco Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ) and aluminum crimp sealed, and incubated at 55 °C in the dark until substantial methane formation was detected after 100 days by analysis of headspace gas on gas chromatography (GC) 
 hese bottles were then flushed with the pure N2 again to remove the methane produced in the headspace; and alkanes-based methanogenic enrichment cultures were then established by transferring 5 ml of the primary incubation culture mentioned above into 120 ml serum bottles, that had been flushed with O2-free N2 (99.99 %), containing each 45 ml mineral salt medium (Wang et al. 2011) 
 fter further flushing the serum bottles for 5 min with pure N2, they were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimps 
 or convenience, B1–B5 and B13 were samples of the alkanesbased methanogenic enrichments collected on day 154, 253, 333, 413, 477 and 749 of incubation, respectively 
 fter taking the incubation cultures for genomic DNA extraction, the aliquot samples were adjusted to pH 12 and then heated for 1 h to 105 °C. n-Alkanes amended into methanogenic enrichment were extracted with n-hexane and analyzed on an Agilent 6890 GC equipped with an  123  1682  HP-5MS capillary column (30 m 9 0.25 mm 9 0.25 lm) and mass detector (MSD 5975) as described by Wang et al. (2011) 
 olatile fatty acids (VFA) were detected on GC– MS after butyl esterification of extract with 1:10 H2SO4– butanol (v/v) at 90 °C for 60 min and being extracted with n-dodecane 
 C– MS analysis was accomplished with the following program: the injector temperature was 250 °C and the oven temperature was held at 120 °C for 3 min, then increased at 8 °C min-1 to 260 °C, and held for 10 min 
 imultaneously, 20 ml of enrichment aliquot were adjusted to pH 12, left for 30 min and heated for 1 h to 105 °C before acidification to pH \2 with HCl and being extracted three times with ethyl ether 
 he injector temperature was 260 °C and the oven temperature was initially held at 80 °C for 3 min, then increased at 10 °C min-1 to 280 °C, and finally held for 37 min 
 NA extraction and PCR amplification Total genomic DNA was extracted from 10 ml of enrichment culture using AxyPrepTM Bacterial Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Axygen Biosciences, Inc., CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol 
 he thermal cycler programs for bacteria and archaea were initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 33 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing gradient from 45 to 55 °C (for bacteria) and a single annealing at 60 °C (for archaea) for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 60 s, and a final elongation step of 72 °C for 10 min 
 he thermal cycler program for assA gene included initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min; followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 36 s, annealing at 60 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min; followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 20 min 
 ubsequently, PCR products resulting from independent 5 reactions were pooled and visualized by agarose gels (1.8 %, w/v) electrophoresis (70 min at 160 V) 
 CR products (20 ll) were loaded onto a 6 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gel with a denaturing gradient of 30–60 % (100 % denaturant contained 40 % formamide and 7 M urea) 
 lectrophoresis was performed for 4.5 h at 160 V and 60 °C in TAE running buffer (40 mM Tris– acetate, 20 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA) 
 he obtained white colonies were randomly picked and cultured overnight at 37 °C in 0.8 ml Luria Broth (LB) medium in the presence of ampicillin (100 mg/ml) 
 artial 16S rRNA gene sequences for bacterial and archaeal as well as assA genes fragments obtained in this study were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers JN836375–JN836429 and JN852952–JN852958.  Results Methanogenic activities in alkanes-based enrichment cultures Thermophilic methanogenic activity in enrichment cultures containing production water of a thermophilic oil reservoir was observed with significant amounts of methane produced in headspace during the 749 days of incubation after transferring into fresh culture media supplemented with long chain n-alkanes (Fig. 1) 
 hese clones were clustered into 16 OTUs at 97 % similarity cut-off and rarefaction analysis indicated that the estimated coverage of the clone library was 91.1 % (Fig. 2) 
 hylogenetic analysis revealed that approximately 45.6 % of the clones in this library were affiliated with the order Methanosarcinales, which is known as a group harboring both acetotrophic and methylotrophic methanogens (Kendall and Boone 2006) 
 n the present case, methylotrophic methanogens represented by OTUs B1-A-103, B1-A-41 and B1-A-64 and closely related (95–99 % similarities) to the genus Methanomethylovorans prevailed 
 he remaining phylotypes, representing 48.9 % of the total archaeal clones in library B1, were assigned to unclassified groups of Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota 
  total of 89 clones were sequenced and clustered into 13 OTUs at 97 % similarity cut-off and rarefaction analysis indicated that the estimated coverage of the clone library was 95.5 % (Fig. 2) 
 nexpectedly, phylogenetic analysis revealed the dominance of Crenarchaeota-like (52.8 % of the total archaeal clones, 4 OTUs) members mostly affiliated with environmental sequences retrieved from subsurface ecosystems (Duncan et al. 2009; Gihring et al. 2006) or with sequences detected in hydrocarbon-associated methanogenic consortia (Penner and Foght 2010; Siegert et al. 2011) 
 ollowing changes observed from the DGGE profiling (Fig. 3), bacterial community compositions were assessed by means of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries focused on samples B1 and B13 collected at days 154 and 749, respectively 
 ithin B1, 19 clones were sequenced and clustered into 4 bacterial OTUs and the estimated coverage of 89.5 % indicated that the bacterial composition needed more sampling for higher coverage (Fig. 4) 
 mong other bacterial members in library B1, 16S rRNA gene sequences clustering with members of Thermodesulfobiaceae (OTU B1-B-62, 2 clones) and Leptospiraceae and Bacteroidetes (OTUs B1-B-33 and B1-B-73, 2 clones in total) were also detected.  In contrast to B1, the bacterial community composition in clone library B13 (n = 170 clones) was slightly more diverse with 8 OTUs detected and the estimated coverage of the clone library of 97.6 % indicated adequate sampling of bacterial members in sample B13 (Fig. 4) 
 he B13 library was dominated by Firmicutes-like members; among which OTUs B13-B-83, B13-B-68 and B13-B-27 representing 90 clones (52.9 % of total bacterial clones within B13) showing high identity with the thermophilic,  123  1686 B13  2  1  all together representing 5 clones (3.0 % of total bacterial clones within library B13).

 he second dominant bacterial members were represented by phylotypes OTUs B13-B-72 and B13-B-103 (44.1 % of total bacterial clones within B13, 75 clones) sharing close similarities with members of the genus Moorella 
 TU B13-assA-1 representing 78 clones (97.5 % of total assA genes in library B13) was 77 % similar at the protein level to deduced reference assA genes from the Syntrophobacteraceae, alkanes-degrader Desulfoglaeba alkanexedens ALDC (Davidova et al. 2006) and methanogenic paraffin degrading enrichment culture (Callaghan et al. 2010) 
 n addition, two clones (2.5 % of total assA genes in library B13) represented by OTU B13-assA-2 and exclusively detected in the n-alkanes-amended methanogenic cultures are close relatives (83 % similarity at the protein level) to the deduced assA1 gene from the  B13 B 72 (74/170, JN836379) B13-B-72 B13-B-103 (1/170, JN836380) B1-B-65 (15/19, JN836375)  96 99  Uncultured Moorella sp. clone LNE-13 (AY531650) 89 Moorella sp. 64_FGQ (GQ872425)  Moorella glycerini JW/AS-Y6 (NR_029198) Thermophilic anaerobic sludge clone C1 (AY526500) Hydrocarbon Metabolism in Oil Sands Tailings clone BTEX1-10F (HM992534) Methanogenic enrichment clone MRE50b24 (AY684084) Thermophilic anaerobic bioreactor clone G55_D25_M_B_F11 (DQ887943)  100  97  B13-B-83 (72/170, JN836381) B13-B-68 (17/170, JN836382) B13 B 27 (1/170 B13-B-27 (1/170, JN836383)  100 77  92 99  90  Thermoanaero obacteraceae  B5  Methanogenic enrichment cloneMRE50b25 (AY684072) Anaerobic digester clone QEDP2DD10 (CU924020)  99  B1-B-33 (1/19, JN836376) 94  100 99  Leptospiraceae  Anaerobic river sediment clone LaC15L128 (EF667524) Uranium contaminated sediments clone FRC-A2_400 (EF508017) Th Thermophilic hili microbial i bi l fuel f l cell ll clone l SHBZ944 (EU639297) Methanongenic community of crude oil-degradation clone L55B-93 (JF947077)  100  Thermodesulfobiaceae  B1-B-62 (2/19, JN836377) 100 Oil contaminated soil of Shengli oilfield clone B312109 (HQ133015)  B13-B-61 (1/170, JN836385)  100  100 Alaskan North Oil Facilities clone PS1SGXI1313 (FJ469327)  Candidate division OP1 Niiboli oilfield clone NRB35 (HM041952) Leaking oil well clone OP1_18_1_D08 (GU120565) 96 Thermotoga hypogea SEBR 7054 (NR_029205) Yabase oil field clone AR80B6 (AB539933) 100 Methanongenic community of crude oil-degradation clone L55B-72 (JF947066) ( , JN836386)) 100 B13-B-100 (3/170, 78 Subsurface crude oil deposit clone SRDP-BD05 (AB546057) Anoxic Lake sediment clone TK-SH11 (DQ463707) Subseafloor sediment clone MD2902-B56 (EU385875) Lake profundal sediment clone c5LKS38 (AM086125)  92 100  B13-B-19 (1/170, JN836384)  95 100  Methanongenic g communityy of crude oil-degradation g clone L35B_38 ((JF946945))  B1-B-73 (1/19, JN836378) 100  123  Anaerobic tank clone BP-B153 (GQ844385) Bacteroidetes Oilfield Bacterium sp 
 n that case, the ratio between the produced and theoretically predicted methane would have been much higher than 17 % calculated assuming that the n-alkanes were totally converted to methane 
 ther sequences retrieved from day 749 were very different and form clusters with Gelria, Thermotogaceae, Chloroflexi, and OP1 (Fig. 6) 
 sing the classifier tool of the RDP Release 10 (Cole et al. 2009), most of the Crenarchaeota-like sequences identified in our thermophilic alkanes-based methanogenic enrichment cultures appear to be related to members of the class Thermoprotei; but represented by low similarities to known cultured species.  123  1688 Fig. 6 Dynamic changes of bacterial community composition in the alkanesamended methanogenic enrichment cultures on days 154 and 749  L

 iodegradation of n-alkanes was observed as methane production in the alkanes-amended methanogenic enrichment reached 141.47 lmol above the controls after 749 days of incubation, corresponding to 17 % of the theoretical total 
 oreover, the appearance of a new assA gene sequence identified in day 749 supported the establishment of a functioning microbial species in the enrichment

 C–MS analysis of enrichment cultures medium showed that approximately 83 % n-alkanes were transformed during the 749 days of incubation compared with the sterile controls 
 owever, approximately 141.47 lmol of methane; corresponding to 17 % of the theoretical value, were obtained in the bottles headspace 
 fter another 600 days of incubation (Sample B13, day 749), the archaeal community experienced some changes 
 hylogenetic analysis revealed that, of the 19 clones from the B1 library, OTU B1-B-65 consisting of 15 clones (78.9 % of total bacterial clones within B1) was a close relative to Moorella glycerini (95 % identity) within the family Thermoanaerobacteraceae 
 hough higher amounts of methane were detected in the n-alkanes-amended methanogenic cultures in comparison to the background controls, stoichiometric estimation indicated only 17 % of the theoretically predicted methane production on day 749 of incubation 
 n contrast, the bacterial population profile retrieved from the n-alkanes amended methanogenic culture at day 749 was quite different

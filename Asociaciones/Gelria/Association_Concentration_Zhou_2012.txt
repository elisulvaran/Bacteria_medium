 his assumption is supported by the fact that CO2-reducing methanogens Methanomicrobiales and Methanobacteriales outnumbered obligate acetoclastic methanogens and represented 80 % of methanogenic archaeal sequences detected in the thermophilic alkanes-amended methanogenic cultures on day 749 Fig . 7 . n-Alkanes C15-C20 Fumarate 1 assA 2 3 Alkylsuccinates Alcohols Branched fatty acids ?

 hemical analyses of methanogenic enrichment cultures Methane and hydrogen gases in the headspace of serum bottles were monitored periodically by injecting 200 ll of the headspace gas into GC equipped with a flame ionization detector FID , a thermal conductivity detector TCD , and a packed 1.5 m stainless steel column filled with 5 Å carbon molecular sieves as previously described Wang et al . 2011 
 he overall biodegradation process is thermodynamically feasible only when methanogenic precursors namely formate acetate and hydrogen gas are completely removed or maintain at very low concentration by methanogens or sulfidogens 
 ur findings are consistent with several reports indicating that alkanes are predominantly degraded to acetate and hydrogen with subsequent syntrophic acetate oxidation to hydrogen and CO2 coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis Gieg et al . 2010 Siddique et al . 2011 . 123 Gelria 52.9 % Moorella 44.1 % B13 N=170 Anaerobic activation of n-alkanes and putative biochemical degradation pathways There are several possible biochemical activation strategies of n-alkanes under anaerobic conditions

 ur results indicate that n-alkanes are converted to methane slowly by a microbial community enriched from oilfield production water and fumarate addition is most likely the initial activation step of n-alkanes degradation under thermophilic methanogenic conditions .

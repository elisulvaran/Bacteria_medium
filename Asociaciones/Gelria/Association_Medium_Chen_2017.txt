FAs produced in the sludge BH included acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid with the fractions of acetic acid increased with BH temperatures 
olatile fatty acid mix standards (Sigma-Aldrich, Canada) including acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, valeric, 4-methylvaleric (isocaproic), hexanoic (caproic), and heptanoic acids were used for the peak identiﬁcation and standard curve determination.  The anaerobic conversion of organics into methane gas involves the hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis steps (Lee et al., 2014) 
FAs determined by the GC analysis in the hydrolyzed sludge included acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, valeric acid, 4-methylvaleric acid (isocaproic), hexanoic acid (caproic), and heptanoic acid (Fig. 1b) 
he concentration of acetic acid increased from 210.8 mg/L at 35 °C, 356.1 mg/L at 42 °C, to 615.0 mg/L at 55 °C 
he sum of the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, and valeric acid counted for 81.5%, 88.0%, and 92.3% of the total detected VFAs at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C, respectively 
he fractions of acetic, isobutyric, and isovalric acid increased while those of propionic acid, valeric acid, isocaproic, caproic, and heptanoic acid reduced with the increase in the hydrolysis temperature (Fig. 1c)

he VFA analysis conﬁrmed that acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, valeric acid, 4-methylvaleric acid (isocaproic), hexanoic acid (caproic), and heptanoic acid were produced in the BH systems 
ydrogen production from acid and enzymatic oat straw hydrolysates in an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor: performance and microbial population analysis 
lostridia contained many types of fermentative organisms that produce hydrogen along with acetate, butyrate, ethanol, etc. (Arreola-Vargas et al., 2013), while Bacteroidia were reported playing a vital role in decomposing solid wastes and generating organic acids (Wong et al., 2013) 
he microbial structure analysis showed that the dominant protein and carbohydrate fermenting bacterial and hydrogen consuming methanogens varied in the sludge hydrolyzed at 35 °C, 42 °C and 55 °C.  4.3 
 pH- and temperature-phased two-stage process for hydrogen and methane production from food waste 
cetogenesis bacteria, or the secondary fermenters, degrade products of the primary fermentation into acetate, H2, and CO2 
he methanogens associated with Methanocorpusculum, Methanobrevibacter and Methanothermobacter were all hydrogenotrophic methanogens that produce methane from CO2 and H2 (Nakamura et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2015), while members of Methanosarcina can use acetate and reduce CO2 with H2 for methane production (Leahy et al., 2017) 
he bacteria associated with Gelria was reported to co-operate with the hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum to degrade glutamate into propionate, H2, NH4, and CO2 and ferment sugars to acetate, propionate, CO2, and H2 (Plugge et al., 2002)

he results showed that the suspended solid reduction, volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, and biogas production increased with the BH temperatures 
t was found that Acidaminobacter at 35 °C, Proteiniphilum and Lutispor at 42 °C, and Gelria at 55 °C were the main protein fermenting bacteria genera, while the carbohydrate fermenting bacteria might belong to the genera of Macellibacteroides and Paludibacter at 35 °C, Fronticella at 42 °C, and Tepidimicrobium at 55 °C.  1

hang  was assessed by examining the change in the sludge TSS and VSS contents according to the Standard Methods (APHA-AWWA-WEF, 2005) 
he VFA compositions were measured using an Agilent 5890 gas chromatography (GC) (Agilent Technologies, US) with an Agilent J & W GC column (DB-FFAP 30 m × 0.25 mm) and a ﬂame ionization detector (FID) 
he injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and nitrogen was used as the carrier gas 
he oven temperature was increased from 80 °C to 120 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min and held at 120 °C for 4 min, and then increased from 120 °C to 220 °C at a rate of 6.1 °C/ min and held at 220 °C for 5 min 
ydrolysis and acidogenesis bacteria, or the so-called primary fermenters, catalyze the extracellular hydrolytic degradation of polymers into oligo- or monomers and intracellular conversion of sugars, amino acids, fatty acids and other monomers into fatty acids, lactate, alcohols, etc 
he methanogenesis converts acetogenesis products into methane gas via two main pathways: acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic CH4 production (Da Silva et al., 2015) 
he complete conversion of complex organics to methane relies on syntrophic interactions of primary fermenters, secondary fermenters, and methanogens because mutual metabolic dependencies between diﬀerent groups of anaerobic microorganisms eliminate the accumulation of intermediate hydrolysis products, making the conversion of complex organics to methane thermodynamically favorable (Schink and Stams, 2013) 
he syntrophic interactions in the sludge BH systems will depend on the microbial community structures and compositions 
hus, the determination of bacterial and archaeal community structures of BH systems would be of great importance for the understanding of microbial syntrophic interactions and process mechanisms of the sludge biological hydrolysis 
ompared to the conventional cultivation and biological molecular methods, Illumina MiSeq Sequencing can generate an enormous number of sequences, providing an excellent platform for the analysis of microorganism communities in wastewater treatment systems (Lin et al., 2016; Sheng et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2016; Zamanzadeh et al., 2016) 
ith the use of Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform, Xie et al. (2016) revealed that the phyla of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes were dominant in the hydrolysis acidiﬁcation reactors treating dyeing wastewater 
in et al. (2016), who investigated the eﬀect of temperature on microbial communities in the anaerobic digestion of organic food waste, revealed that the phyla of Firmicutes, Chloroﬂexi, Bacteoridetes, and Actinobacteria were dominant under mesophilic conditions while the phyla of Firmicutes, Thermotogo, Synergistales dominated under thermophilic conditions 
t can exert a critical impact on the types of microorganisms, fermentation pathways, and end-products of sludge BH 
n this study bench-scale hydrolysis and biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests were carried out to assess the performance of sludge BH at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C 
ased on the MiSeq sequencing results, the characteristics of microbial community structures, syntrophic interactions and main functional fermenting bacteria under mesophilic and thermophilic BH conditions were discussed.  2.2 
he BMP test procedure followed those of Owen et al.(1979) and Angelidaki et al. (2009) with modiﬁcations 
rieﬂy, the main steps included (1) ﬁlling 30 mL of the hydrolyzed sludge and the equal volume of seed sludge into a 125 mL serum bottles (American Scientiﬁc Products, McGraw Park III); (2) ﬂushing the headspace of the bottles with N2 for 15 s; and (3) capping the BMP bottles with rubbers and aluminum crimp; and (4) placing the sealed BMP bottles upside down in a shaking incubator (New Brunswick Scientiﬁc C25) with the temperature setting at 35 °C 
he BMP tests lasted for 10 days and the biogas produced during the BMP test periods was measured using glass syringes (Popper and Sons Inc.) ﬁtted with a disposable needle 
MP bottles only ﬁlled with AD seed sludge and MilliQ water were used as the blanks to estimate the biogas generated from the seed sludge 
riplicated BMP bottles were used for each of the hydrolysis temperature conditions and the blanks. 2.3 
NA extraction The PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MOBIO Laboratories, Inc.) was used to extract DNA from the raw sludge and hydrolyzed sludge 
he sludge samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min and the pellets were used for DNA extraction according to the PowerSoil kit manufacture’s protocol 
he extracted DNA was quantiﬁed by using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Canada) and stored at −20 °C for further use. 2.4. 16S rDNA gene ampliﬁcation and Illumina MiSeq sequencing The primer pairs of 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG-3′) and 926R (5′-CCGTCAATTCMTTTGAGTTT-3′) that have been demonstrated to have the high coverages of almost all phyla in metagenomic analyses (Baker et al., 2003) were used to amplify the V4 and V5 regions of bacterial 16S rRNA genes of the extracted DNA 
he primer pairs of 519F (5′-CAGCCGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 915R (5′-GTGCTCCCCCGCCAATTCCT-3′) were used to amplify the 16S rRNA genes of methanogenic archaeal (Wei et al., 2015) 
he PCR reaction agent consisted of the 1 μL template, 1 μL of 10 mM dNTPs, 1 μL of 10 μM of primers, 1 U of Phusion DNA Polymerase, and 10 μL of 5 × reaction buﬀer (New England Biolabs, USA) 
he bacterial and archaeal PCR conditions were programmed as: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles for bacteria or 30 cycles for archaea at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 30 s; with a ﬁnal extension of 72 °C for 5 min 
A, USA) was used to attach 5′ MiSeq adapter and barcode to the amplicons for multiplexing following the manufacture’s protocol 
he amplicons were puriﬁed using the DNA gel extraction kit of AxyPrepDNA (Axygen, China) and quantiﬁed by using the FTC-3000TM real-time PCR before  2 
aterial and methods 2.1 
ludge source and hydrolysis experiments The raw sludge (RS) and seed sludge used in the BMP tests were taken, respectively, from the secondary clariﬁer and the anaerobic digester of Guelph Wastewater Treatment Plant, Ontario, Canada, and were transported to the laboratory within 2 h 
or the BH experiments, the RS was ﬁlled into a 1.5 L plastic bottle without addition of seed sludge, ﬂushed with N2 for 1 min, and then sealed for hydrolysis reactions 
he hydrolysis experiments at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C were carried out in parallel by placing these sludgeﬁlled plastic bottles into shaking incubators at the desired temperatures for six days 
llumina data analysis All sequences were read and classiﬁed according to the barcodes after sequencing on the MiSeq platform 
he remaining sequences after assembling of contigs and ﬁltering of length and ambiguous reads were aligned with the version 119 of SILVA databases (Pruesse et al., 2007) 
ll reads of the archaeal communities were merged and trimmed as bacteria 
he richnesses were described based on the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) and species richness estimators (Chao1) 
he microbiological similarities for the sludge samples obtained under diﬀerent conditions were calculated by the OTU overlapping in Venn diagram, and the distances of variation of microbiological communities were presented by the principal component analysis (PCA). 3

ig. 1a–c show the TSS and VSS reductions, VFA concentrations, and VFA fractions at the end of 6-day hydrolysis at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C 
he VSS reductions of 35.4%, 37.3%, and 42.4% and TSS reductions of 28.9%, 31.0%, and 33.5% were achieved in the 6-day hydrolysis at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C, respectively (Fig. 1a) 
ccordingly, the VFA concentrations in sludge were increased from the initial concentration of 24.5 mg/L to 666.5 mg/L, 918.4 mg/L, and 1398.5 mg/L in the 6-d hydrolysis at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C, respectively 
hese results indicated that BH temperature not only exerted a positive eﬀect on the sludge solubilization and VFA productions but also aﬀected the compositions of VFAs 
ig. 2 shows that the accumulated biogas produced by sludge hydrolyzed at 35 °C, 42, oC, and 55 °C 
s shown in Fig. 2, sludge treated at 42 °C and 55 °C showed a higher biogas production than that treated at 35 °C although no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in biogas production from sludge treated at diﬀerent temperatures was observed in the ﬁrst 50 h of the BMP tests.  Fig. 1

he Shannon index of the RS, BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge was 4.6, 4.5, 4.3, and 4.5 respectively, corresponding to ACE of 602, 707, 675, and 730, respectively, and Chao1 of 606, 708, 694, and 740, respectively 
he RS and the BH treated samples all showed the high indexes, suggesting the high bacterial diversities and richness of these sludge samples 
he samples tested had a total 380 overlapped OTUs with 468 OTUs overlapped among the sludge hydrolyzed at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C 
he overlapped OTUs between the RS and the hydrolyzed sludge were 473, 470, and 501 for the BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge, respectively 
t is interesting to note that there were more overlapped OTUs between the BH55 and RS sludge than between the RS and the BH35 or BH42 sludge 
he average total eﬀective sequencing tags were 62,439 for the RS, and 58,803, 67,348, and 73,988 for the BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge, respectively. 504  Bioresource Technology 245 (2017) 502–510  H

he dominant phyla in the BH55 sludge were Proteobacteria (47.6%) and Firmicutes (34.0%), plus a signiﬁcant amount of Actinobacteria (5.6%), Tenericutes (4.1%), and Bacteroidetes (4.2%) 
oth the RS and BH55 sludge showed a high population of bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria, which may explain the high similarity in the 16S rRNA gene sequences between the RS and BH55 sludge (Fig. 3b) 
t the phylum level, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria populations increased with the BH temperatures, while Bacteroidetes decreased dramatically at 55 °C (Fig. 4a–c) 
t the class level, the top 5 predominant classes in the RS were βproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Sphingobacteriia, α-proteobacteria, and γproteobacteria, which accounted for 30.8%, 14.9%, 14.7%, 13.3%, and 11.2% of total detected OTUs, respectively (Fig. 4b) 
fter the RS had been hydrolyzed at 35 °C for six days, the dominant classes in the sludge changed to Bacteroidia (33.3%), unclassiﬁed (19.0%), Clostridia (15.9%), α-proteobacteria (6.3%), and Spirochaetes (4.1%) (Fig. 4b), showing that the anaerobic hydrolysis caused a substantial reduction in the population of β-proteobacteria, Flavobacteria, and γ-proteobacteria 
he dominant classes with the BH42 sludge were Clostridia (30.4%), Bacteroidia (30.2%), β-proteobacteria (10.7%), α-proteobacteria (6.1%), and γ-proteobacteria (6.3%)

he bacteria associated with the classes of Clostridia and β-Proteobacteria evidently increased with the increase in temperature 
hus, Clostridia was identiﬁed as the dominant class of phylum Firmicutes in the BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge and Bacteroidia as the dominant class of the phylum of Bacteroidetes in the BH35 and BH42 sludge

or the BH35 and BH42 sludge samples, around 30% of the identiﬁed OTUs belonged to Rikenellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae, while the fractions of these two families in the BH55 sludge drastically decreased to less than 3% 
lso, the family Spirochaetaceae that has members to metabolize carbohydrates and amino acids showed a signiﬁcant presence in BH35 sludge but much less in the BH42 and BH55 sludge 
n addition, the families of Comamonadaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Thermoanaerobacteraceae dominated at 55 °C but only existed as minor groups in the BH35 and BH42 sludge samples 
he fractions of OTUs of unclassiﬁed genera were 32.8%, 60.1%, 51.0%, and 33.4% for the RS, BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge, respectively

he class of Methanomicrobia accounted for 84% of the total archaeal OTUs for the BH35 sludge, 40% for the BH42 sludge, and 19% for the BH55 sludge, while Methanobacteria accounted for 14% for the BH35 sludge, 56% for the 506  Bioresource Technology 245 (2017) 502–510  H

verall, Methanocorpusculum ﬂourished at 35 °C; Methanobrevibacter and Methanosarcina well grew at 42 °C; and Methanothermobacter became dominant at 55 °C.  Table 1 Phylogenetic family structures of the RS, BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge (OTUs fraction > 1%) 
he sludge BH at 55 °C enhanced the reduction of suspended solid (TSS and VSS) and production of VFA, in agreement with the previous studies reported by Zhang et al. (2009), who showed that the VSS reduction by thermophilic fermentation was greater than that by mesophilic fermentation 
hese notable processing changes of hydrolyzed sludge at diﬀerent BH temperatures were further linked to the change in the bacterial and archaeal structure by Illumina MiSeq sequencing 
axonomic identiﬁcation showed the shifts of microbiological structures with the BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge at diﬀerent levels in present work 
able 2 summarized the main genera identiﬁed at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C that may contain typical protein and carbohydrate fermenting bacterial species, most of which were isolated from wastewater treatment systems 
he main protein fermenting bacteria could be associated with the genera of Acidaminobacter at 35 °C, Lutispora and Proteiniphilum at 42 °C, and Gelria, Tepidimicrobium, and Lutispora (2.0%) at 55 °C 
he dominant carbohydrates fermenting bacteria also varied in the BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge (Table 2) 
he isolated species of Macellibacteroides can utilize a broad range of mono- and disaccharides as electron donors with the main fermentation products to be lactate, acetate, butyrate and isobutyrate from glucose metabolism (Jabari et al., 2012) 
ther carbohydrates fermenting bacteria detected in BH35 sludge could be associated with the genera of Paludibacter and Fusibacter (Ueki et al., 2006; Ravot et al., 1999)

irmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria accounted for more than 90% of the total identiﬁed OTUs in the BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge 
hese phyla were also identiﬁed as the dominant bacteria phyla, by other researchers, in the wastewater hydrolysis acidiﬁcation reactors (Xie et al., 2016), the anaerobic sewage sludge co-digestion reactors (Yang et al., 2016), and the conventional anaerobic digesters (Nelson et al., 2011) 
onsidering the complexity of microbiology in wastewater treatment systems, the descriptions of bacterial roles at class and family levels were widely accepted 
or example, the classes of Clostridia and Bacteroidia that were found as dominant bacteria in the present study were previously depicted by Yang et al. (2015b) as dominant classes in Geobacillus sp 
n this study, the classes of Clostridia and Bacteroidia accounted for total fractions of 49.3% and 60.6% of the identiﬁed OTUs in the BH35 and BH42 sludge, respectively 
t can be speculated that bacteria associated with these classes played a major role in the mesophilic sludge solubilization and VFA production, while the class of Clostridia that counted for 28.1% of total OTUs in the BH55 sludge should play a major role in the sludge thermophilic fermentation 
t was reported that bacteria associated with the Ruminococcaceae family can grow rapidly on cellulose and hemicellulose (Ali Shah et al., 2014) 
he considerably increased Ruminococcaceae population at 55 °C might suggest that the degradation of cellulose components of sewage sludge can be enhanced by thermophilic BH, which could, to some extent, contribute to the increased VSS reduction and VFAs productions at 55 °C.  Black mud  H 
he presence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens could be critical to the effective conversion of complex organics to acetate and other methanogen usable organics although methane production is not a primary objective of the BH 
hus, the higher acetate fractions obtained at 55 °C could be, to some extent, related to the enhanced syntrophic interactions between diﬀerent groups of organisms.  carbohydrate fermenting bacteria were likely associated with the genera of Fronticella (3.2%), Macellibacteroides (3.2%), and Paludibacter (2.8%) 
or BH55, dominant bacteria Gelria and Tepidimicrobium that can use both protein and carbohydrate were not found in BH 35 and BH42, implying that thermophilic selected bacteria can exert a strong function in degradation of complex organics 
t is worth noting that bacteria associated with the genera of Macellibacteroides, Paludibacter, Fonticellla, and Tepidimicrobium were reported to be able to utilize sugars from the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose, including xylose, arabinose, cellobiose, and mannose, etc 
his may imply that these carbohydrates fermenting bacterial could play an important role in degrading cellulose and hemicellulose materials to VFAs (Table 2).  5 
onclusions The results showed that the volatile suspended solids (VSS) reduction, volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, and biogas production increased with the increase in the BH temperature 
he Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis revealed: Bacteroidetes (46.8%), Firmicutes (19.8%), Proteobacteria (14.1%), and Spirochaetes (13.3%) dominated in the BH35 sludge; Bacteroidetes (37.9%), Firmicutes (30.9%), and Proteobacteria (25.2%) dominated in the BH42 sludge, and Proteobacteria (47.6%) and Firmicutes (34.0%) dominated in the BH55 sludge 
icrobial syntrophic interactions The protein- and carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria identiﬁed in the BH systems could produce a wide range of VFAs from fermentation of amino acids and sugars (Table 2) 
ome secondary fermentation processes will degrade fatty acids with chains longer than 2 carbon atoms, alcohols longer than one carbon atoms, and branched-chain VFAs, and aromatic VFAs to acetate for methane production (Schink and Stams, 2013) 
n this study, the main hydrogen-consuming bacteria could be hydrogenotrophic methanogens, including Methanocorpusculum in the BH35 sludge, Methanobrevibacter and Methanosarcina in the BH42 sludge, and Methanothermobacter in the BH55 sludge 
n addition to hydrogenotrophic methanogens, other H2-utilizing bacteria identiﬁed in the BH systems in this study could include Fusibacter (Ravot et al., 1999) with the BH35 sludge and Tepidimicrobium (Niu et al., 2009) with the BH55 sludge 
n the BH42 and BH55 sludge around 4.3%–5.6% OTUs were identiﬁed associated with the genus of Albidiferax 
his genus contains Fe (III) and Mn (IV) reducing bacteria that could also be potential H2 consumers 
cidaminobacter and Gelria identiﬁed in the BH35 and BH55 sludge could be syntrophic partners with hydrogen-consuming bacteria 
tams and Hansen (1984) reported that the rate of the conversion of glutamate to acetate by Acidaminobacter hydrogenoformans was greatly enhanced in the mixed cultures with sulfate-reducing bacterium of Desulfobulbus propionicus or H2 utilizing Methanospirillum hungatei 
he VFA analysis showed that the total fractions of VFAs longer than 2 carbon atoms were 68.7% for BH35, 61.2% for BH42, and 56.0% for BH55, showing a positive impact of hydrolysis temperatures on the  Acknowledgements The authors wish to thank Ontario Centres of Excellence (OCE), The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and GE Water & Process Technologies for support

he Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis showed that the microbial taxonomic structures of the BH systems varied with BH temperatures 
iological hydrolysis/acidiﬁcation (BH) is a widely used pre-treatment process to increase the methanogenic degradation of complex organic compounds for methane production (Ding et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2011;  ⁎  Corresponding author

his study also showed that the family Ruminococcaceae increased sharply with the increase of the BH temperature 
t is well-known that thermophilic conditions favor the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens 
owever, most of the secondary fermentation processes are only thermodynamically favorable at low H2 partial pressures, e.g. < 10−5 bar

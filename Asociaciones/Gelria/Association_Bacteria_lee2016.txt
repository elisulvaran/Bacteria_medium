ixteen bacterial genera that showed relative abundance > 0.5% in one of the eight samples were considered high-rank groups: Tepidanaerobacter (20.6 ± 15.1%), Anaerobaculum (19.1 ± 18.6%), Defluviitoga (10.4 ± 8.9%), Keratinibaculum (8.1 ± 8.3%), Gelria (7.9 ± 8.2%), Tepidimicrobium (3.4 ± 5.0%), Caldicoprobacter (2.5 ± 1.2%), Bacillus (1.8 ± 4.4%), Syntrophaceticus (1.7 ± 2.8%), Ruminiclostridium (0.6 ± 1.1%), Lactobacillus (0.4 ± 0.6%), Halocella (0.3 ± 0.3%), Proteiniphilum (0.3 ± 0.6%), Methyloversatilis (0.2 ± 0.3%), Syntrophomonas (0.2 ± 0.2%), Haloplasma (0.1 ± 0.3%) (Fig 2a) 
ll of the bacterial reads (17 073 reads) were classified into one of nine phyla: Firmicutes (66.6 ± 20.1%), Synergistetes  J 
he overwhelming dominance of Firmicutes has been commonly reported in labscale [28] and full-scale thermophilic anaerobic digesters [29] 
n this study, of 116 OTUs (i.e., total number of bacterial OTUs found in this study), 90 (78%) were classified into Firmicutes and a large portion of unclassified reads at the class level (92%) belonged to Firmicutes 
his result indicates that Firmicutes was highly diverse and contributed significantly to the decrease in R between the phylum and class levels 
ne report demonstrated that the types and compositions of substrates fed to the AD systems determined the ratio RFB of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (e.g., high RFB for easilydegradable substrates, low RFB for fibrous substrate) [31] 
epidanaerobacter, Anaerobaculum, Defluviitoga, Keratinibaculum, Gelria, Tepidimicrobium, Caldicoprobacter, Bacillus, and Syntrophaceticus were the major bacterial genera, and Methanoculleus and Methanobacterium were the major archaeal genera 
ll (3 822) of the archaeal reads were classified into seven methanogen genera: Methanoculleus (63.7 ± 44.4%), Methanobacterium (30.7 ± 40.2%), Methanolinea (2.2 ± 4.2%), Methanothermobacter (1.6 ± 4.4%), Methanospirillum (0.9 ± 2.2%), Methanogenium (0.9 ± 2.2%), and Methanosaeta (0.1 ± 0.2%) (Fig. 2b) 
he shifts are mainly explained by shifts of dominant methanogen from Methanoculleus to Methanobacterium (i.e., a negative correlation  between these most-abundant genera, r = 0.971, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2b). [Ammonia] in the digester was a significant process variable (p < 0.1) among process variables to explain variations in archaeal community structures among the samples (Fig. 3b) 
he opposite correlations of Methanobacterium and Methanoculleus with [ammonia] (r = 0.829, p < 0.05 and r = 0.874, p < 0.05, respectively) supported this hypothesis 
his speculation is supported by the results that [ammonia] in the digester was positively correlated with relative abundances of Tepidanaerobacter (a genus that includes syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria, and that comprised 20.6 ± 15.1% of total bacteria; r = 0.657, p < 0.1) and of Methanobacterium (an HM genus that comprised 30.7 ± 40.2% of total archaea; r = 0.829, p < 0.05). 3.4 
. acetatoxydans was detected in this study; this species can grow in co-culture with HMs including Methanoculleus sp. and Methanobacterium sp., which were dominant methanogens in the TC digester [33,35] 
he relative abundance of Tepidanaerobacter was correlated positively with the relative abundance of Methanobacterium (r = 0.598) and negatively with the relative abundance of Methanoculleus (r = 0.713, p < 0.05); these opposite relationships suggest that Methanobacterium might be a preferred syntrophic partner in methanogenesis under the ammonia-stressed condition in the TC digester.

[Na+] and [lipid] in the digester was negatively correlated with COD removal of the AD system, but [ammonia] was not. (2) Tepidanaerobacter, Anaerobaculum, and Defluviitoga, Keratinibaculum, Gelria, Tepidimicrobium, Caldicoprobacter, Bacillus, and Syntrophaceticus were dominant bacterial genera, and Methanoculleus and Methanobacterium were dominant archaeal genera. (3) Both total bacterial and archaeal populations were positively correlated with COD removal but negatively correlated with [Na+] and [lipid] in the digester

oncentrations of Na+ and lipid in the digester were negatively correlated with total bacterial and archaeal populations determined by real-time quantitative PCR 
hese concentrations could also significantly affect the bacterial community structure (e.g., negative correlations with Gelria), but not archaeal community structure 
ipid concentration was negatively correlated with bacterial diversity, but was not correlated with archaeal diversity 
mmonia concentration in the digester (2.0–4.3 g N/L) had no significant correlation with COD removal or total bacterial/archaeal populations, but could significantly affect both bacterial and archaeal community structures, including syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens 
elative abundances of bacterial OTUs or archaeal OTUs obtained by 454 pyrosequencing analysis were used as the data sets 
PCR analysis of total microbial populations To investigate the relationship between variations in microbial population and the perturbations in [Na+] and [lipid], total bacterial and archaeal populations of the eight seasonal samples were quantified using QPCR 
mong these sixteen genera, Tepidanaerobacter, Anaerobaculum, Defluviitoga, Keratinibaculum, Gelria, Tepidimicrobium, Caldicoprobacter, Bacillus, and Syntrophaceticus were dominant (96% of the average abundance of classified bacterial genera and each contributing P 1.0% on average) (Fig. 2a). 454 pyrosequencing of the eight samples yielded 8 130 nonchimeric archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequence reads; 3 822 (478 ± 642 reads per sample) remained as rigid reads and were grouped into nine OTUs for further analysis

n the Joint NMS ordination plot based on archaeal OTUs, significant shifts of methanogen community structure occurred three times: TC1 to TC2, TC6 to TC7, and TC7 to TC8 (Fig. 3b) 
he vector to [ammonia] in the digester points up axis 2; this orientation suggests that [ammonia] could have a significant effect on the significant shifts of archaeal community structures 
hey seemed also to influence variations in total archaeal population, but not archaeal community structure 
n contrast, [ammonia] in the digester (2.0–4.3 g N/L; 0.1–2.0 g free ammonia N/L) was the only factor that affected the shifts of archaeal community structures, but it had no significant correlation with COD removal and total bacterial population 
urthermore, the fact that [ammonia] had similar effects on bacterial and archaeal community structures implies that perturbing [ammonia] could cause critical changes in syntrophic consortia (of bacteria and archaea) that perform methanogenesis in the TC digester 
oint NMS ordination plots for TC samples based on Sorensen (Bray–Curtis) distance with relative abundance of (a) bacterial OTUs, and (b) archaeal OTUs 
acterial and archaeal diversity indices were separately quantified based on rigid OTUs (P 0.5% relative abundance in one of eight samples) 
or archaea, [TVFA] in the digester was positively correlated with H; this relationship indicates that process instability could occur as archaeal diversity increased 
elria and Cardiocoprobacter showed opposite responses to [Na+] and [lipid] in the digester, and may be microbial indicators of process abnormality in thermophilic CSTR AD systems that treat FRW. [Ammonia] in the digester could solely affect both bacterial and archaeal community structures, especially in the dominance and the variations in SAOB (i.e., Tepidanaerobacter) and HMs (i.e., Methanoculleus, Methanobacterium) genera, which were explained by variation in [ammonia]. (5) Bacterial diversity was negatively correlated with [lipid] 
o summarize, high [Na+] > 7 g Na+/L and high [lipid] > 5 g lipid/ L might result in decrease of overall bacteria and archaeal functionalities in the thermophilic AD system; in turn, this repression would reduce COD removal 
he high CV of carbohydrate content resulted mainly from relatively lower values of carbohydrate contents in summer samples (17% of VS), TC4 and TC8, compared to spring (29%), fall (34%), and winter (54%) samples. [TVFA] was higher in the summer (19.0 g/L) than in other seasons (7.7– 10.9 g/L) (Fig. 1a)

ot-blot hybridizations were performed with strain TGOT, Moorella thermoacetica, Moorella glycerini and Escherichia coli as described by Oude Elferink et al. (1997) 
T–PCR of the 16S rRNA genes of strain TGOT, Moorella thermoacetica, Moorella glycerini and Escherichia coli was performed by means of bacterial primers 7f and 1510r using the Access RT–PCR system (Promega) 
ot-blot hybridizations with specific oligonucleotides against these regions showed no hybridization with 16S rRNA from strain TGOT, Moorella glycerini, Moorella thermoacetica and Escherichia coli 
n co-culture with the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum strain Z-245, strain TGOT could grow on glutamate, proline and Casamino acids 
or the reconstitution experiments with axenic cultures of strain TGOT (0n5 %, v\v), strain TPO (2 %, v\v) and Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245 (2 %, v\v) were inoculated in medium with 20 mM glutamate 
tilization of substrates by strain TGOT in pure culture and in co-culture with Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245 was determined by monitoring growth and substrate depletion as well as product formation 
hysiological characterization  Strain TGOT was able to grow on glutamate only in the presence of the methanogenic archaeon Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245 
he doubling time of strain TGOT in co-culture with Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245 on glutamate was 0n23 day−"

ar, 0n1 (evolutionary distance).  No growth of strain TGOT was observed in pure culture or in co-culture with Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245 on aspartate, alanine, lysine, threonine, leucine, tyrosine, glycine, fumarate, malate, succinate, propionate, acetate, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, acetone, benzoate, starch or H \CO . # but # The following mixtures of amino acids were tested were not utilized by the pure culture of strain TGOT : alaninejglycine, alaninejarginine, alaninejproline, leucinejglycine, leucinejarginine, leucinejproline, H jglycine, H jarginine and H jproline 
econstitution of the original consortium from axenic cultures of strain TGOT, strain TPO and Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245  In order to investigate glutamate utilization as originally observed in the propionate-oxidizing enrichment culture, we performed reconstitution experiments with three axenic cultures : strain TGOT, strain TPO (the syntrophic propionate-oxidizing organism) and Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245

hylogenetic analysis of 18 thermophilic Methanobacterium isolates supports the proposals to create a new genus, Methanothermobacter gen. nov., and to reclassify several isolates in three species, Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus comb. nov., Methanothermobacter wolfeii comb. nov., and Methanothermobacter marburgensis sp. nov

he conversion of amino acids in methanogenic environments has been studied over the last 20 years, especially in temperate environments (Barker, 1981 ; Nagase & Matsuo, 1982 ; McInerney, 1989) 
he colonies were white and round at the surface and lens-shaped in the agar 
hylogenetic analysis and tree construction were performed with the programs of the  software package (Strunk & Ludwig, 1991).  homology searches with sequences of the EMBL and GenBank DNA databases were performed and the results were compared with those obtained with the  programs

he tree is based on a distance matrix of 16S rRNA sequences and was constructed using the neighbour-joining method corrected by the method of Felsenstein (1982)

t is unclear why strain TGOT does not form acetate from glutamate, even though acetate production could be detected after growth on several sugars, lactate and pyruvate

 he main protein fermenting bacteria could be associated with the genera of Acidaminobacter at 35 °C Lutispora and Proteiniphilum at 42 °C and Gelria Tepidimicrobium and Lutispora 2.0 % at 55 °C 
 irmicutes Proteobacteria Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria accounted for more than 90 % of the total identiﬁed OTUs in the BH35 BH42 and BH55 sludge 
 n this study the classes of Clostridia and Bacteroidia accounted for total fractions of 49.3 % and 60.6 % of the identiﬁed OTUs in the BH35 and BH42 sludge respectively 
 t can be speculated that bacteria associated with these classes played a major role in the mesophilic sludge solubilization and VFA production while the class of Clostridia that counted for 28.1 % of total OTUs in the BH55 sludge should play a major role in the sludge thermophilic fermentation 
 hus the higher acetate fractions obtained at 55 °C could be to some extent related to the enhanced syntrophic interactions between diﬀerent groups of organisms . carbohydrate fermenting bacteria were likely associated with the genera of Fronticella 3.2 % , Macellibacteroides 3.2 % , and Paludibacter 2.8 %

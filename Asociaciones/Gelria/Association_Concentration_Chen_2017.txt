 he VFA compositions were measured using an Agilent 5890 gas chromatography (GC) (Agilent Technologies, US) with an Agilent J & W GC column (DB-FFAP 30 m × 0.25 mm) and a ﬂame ionization detector (FID) 
 he oven temperature was increased from 80 °C to 120 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min and held at 120 °C for 4 min, and then increased from 120 °C to 220 °C at a rate of 6.1 °C/ min and held at 220 °C for 5 min 
 rieﬂy, the main steps included (1) ﬁlling 30 mL of the hydrolyzed sludge and the equal volume of seed sludge into a 125 mL serum bottles (American Scientiﬁc Products, McGraw Park III); (2) ﬂushing the headspace of the bottles with N2 for 15 s; and (3) capping the BMP bottles with rubbers and aluminum crimp; and (4) placing the sealed BMP bottles upside down in a shaking incubator (New Brunswick Scientiﬁc C25) with the temperature setting at 35 °C 
 he BMP tests lasted for 10 days and the biogas produced during the BMP test periods was measured using glass syringes (Popper and Sons Inc.) ﬁtted with a disposable needle 
 he sludge samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min and the pellets were used for DNA extraction according to the PowerSoil kit manufacture’s protocol 
 he PCR reaction agent consisted of the 1 μL template, 1 μL of 10 mM dNTPs, 1 μL of 10 μM of primers, 1 U of Phusion DNA Polymerase, and 10 μL of 5 × reaction buﬀer (New England Biolabs, USA) 
 he bacterial and archaeal PCR conditions were programmed as: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles for bacteria or 30 cycles for archaea at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 30 s; with a ﬁnal extension of 72 °C for 5 min 
 or the BH experiments, the RS was ﬁlled into a 1.5 L plastic bottle without addition of seed sludge, ﬂushed with N2 for 1 min, and then sealed for hydrolysis reactions 
 he hydrolysis experiments at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C were carried out in parallel by placing these sludgeﬁlled plastic bottles into shaking incubators at the desired temperatures for six days 
 ccordingly, the VFA concentrations in sludge were increased from the initial concentration of 24.5 mg/L to 666.5 mg/L, 918.4 mg/L, and 1398.5 mg/L in the 6-d hydrolysis at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C, respectively 
 he dominant bacterial genera in the sludge switched to Macellibacteroides (7.5%) and Acidaminobacter (5.6%) after being hydrolyzed at 35 °C for six days

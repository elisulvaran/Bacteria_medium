 arbohydrate concentration was measured using the phenol–sulfuric acid method [13] 
 mmonia concentration in the digester (2.0–4.3 g N/L) had no significant correlation with COD removal or total bacterial/archaeal populations, but could significantly affect both bacterial and archaeal community structures, including syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens 
 ntroduction Food waste is one of the three largest components by weight of the organic waste stream in Korea; 8.4 million tons of food waste and wastewater (14.3% of total organic waste generation) was generated in 2011 [1] 
 uring the recycling process, 3.4 million tons of food waste-recycling wastewater (FRW, also referred to as food waste leachate or food wastewater) have been generated annually, and constituted 41% of the total annual food waste and wastewater generation in 2011 [1] 
 rocess imbalance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis may occur (i.e., the total concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) [TVFA] produced by acidogens exceeds the amount of VFAs consumed by methanogens) as a result of hydraulic or organic overloading, the presence of compounds that inhibit anaerobes, or changes in process conditions and influent substrate [3] 
 rotein concentration and total ammonia nitrogen [ammonia] were determined using the Kjeldahl method [12] 
 fter an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed (denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min), followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min 
 rocess variables with p < 0.1 were selected and used as the second matrix to construct a Joint NMS ordination plot 
 hese variations were higher than those of VS (21%) and COD (17%); i.e., temporal variations in composition exceeded those in total organic concentration 
 OD removal decreased significantly when [Na+] in the digester reached 7.1–7.7 g/L (e.g., in TC1, TC3, and TC4); this response is consistent with a previous report that thermophilic AD was severely inhibited by the presence of 7.8 g Na+/ L [26] 
 he total population of bacteria was 1.4  1010 ± 1.5  1010 rRNA gene copies/mL, and the total population of archaea was 9.1  107 ± 1.1  108 16S rRNA gene copies/mL (Supplementary Fig. 1), and both were positively correlated with variation in COD removal (r = 0.782, p < 0.05 and r = 0.664, p < 0.1, respectively) but negatively correlated with [Na+] and [lipid] in the digester (Supplementary Fig. 1); the second of these results suggests that high [Na+] and [lipid] inhibited the growth of both bacteria and archaea, and reduced overall process performance. 3.2.1 
 mong these sixteen genera, Tepidanaerobacter, Anaerobaculum, Defluviitoga, Keratinibaculum, Gelria, Tepidimicrobium, Caldicoprobacter, Bacillus, and Syntrophaceticus were dominant (96% of the average abundance of classified bacterial genera and each contributing P 1.0% on average) (Fig. 2a). 454 pyrosequencing of the eight samples yielded 8 130 nonchimeric archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequence reads; 3 822 (478 ± 642 reads per sample) remained as rigid reads and were grouped into nine OTUs for further analysis 
 his speculation is supported by the results that [ammonia] in the digester was positively correlated with relative abundances of Tepidanaerobacter (a genus that includes syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria, and that comprised 20.6 ± 15.1% of total bacteria; r = 0.657, p < 0.1) and of Methanobacterium (an HM genus that comprised 30.7 ± 40.2% of total archaea; r = 0.829, p < 0.05). 3.4 
 ominant bacteria genera (P 1.0% in relative abundance on average) are expressed in bold and underlined. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)  297  Anaerobaculum (19.1%) was the second most-dominant genus, and could significantly contribute to carbohydrate removal (r = 0.692, p < 0.1) in the TC digester (Supplementary Table 1) 
 o summarize, high [Na+] > 7 g Na+/L and high [lipid] > 5 g lipid/ L might result in decrease of overall bacteria and archaeal functionalities in the thermophilic AD system; in turn, this repression would reduce COD removal

 urthermore, the relative abundance of Tepidanaerobacter increased as [ammonia] increased (r = 0.657, p < 0.1) (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 1); i.e., Tepidanaerobacter was not inhibited by [ammonia] within the range of 2.0–4.3 g N/ L (0.1–2.0 g free ammonia N/L) in the TC digester 
 naerobaculum was abnormally dominant at TC4 (60.8%) when NaCl concentration was the highest (10.7 g/L) among the samples (Fig. 2a), this response is consistent with the observation that A. hydrogeniformans requires high NaCl concentration (10 g/L) for optimum growth

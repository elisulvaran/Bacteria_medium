 arbohydrate concentration was measured using the phenol–sulfuric acid method 13 
 he organic component of the FRW consisted of carbohydrate 35 % of volatile solids , protein 34 % and lipid 30 % 
 mmonia concentration in the digester 2.0–4.3 g N/L had no significant correlation with COD removal or total bacterial/archaeal populations but could significantly affect both bacterial and archaeal community structures including syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens 
 ntroduction Food waste is one of the three largest components by weight of the organic waste stream in Korea 8.4 million tons of food waste and wastewater 14.3 % of total organic waste generation was generated in 2011 1 
 n Korea food waste has been selectively collected among household wastes by law since 2003 and > 95 % is recycled as animal feed or compost 
 uring the recycling process 3.4 million tons of food waste-recycling wastewater FRW also referred to as food waste leachate or food wastewater have been generated annually and constituted 41 % of the total annual food waste and wastewater generation in 2011 1 
 rocess imbalance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis may occur i.e. the total concentration of volatile fatty acids VFAs TVFA produced by acidogens exceeds the amount of VFAs consumed by methanogens as a result of hydraulic or organic overloading the presence of compounds that inhibit anaerobes or changes in process conditions and influent substrate [ 3 
 RW is reported to contain high contents of lipid 30.5 g/L 37 % of volatile solids VS protein 24.6 g/L 30 % of VS and Na+ 2.1 g/L for FRW 6.9 g/L for food waste , so potentially-inhibitory compounds such as long chain fatty acids specified as lipid ) , ammonia , and Na+ could be primary concerns in AD of FRW 2,5,6 
 efore extraction of genomic DNA 200 ll of sample was centrifuged at 16 000 g for 10 min and 100 ll of the supernatant was decanted 
 he pellets including the extracted DNA were eluted with 100 ll of Tris–HCl buffer pH 8.0 and stored at 20 °C until further analyzed . 2.3 
 he pH chemical oxygen demand COD and VS concentrations were determined according to the procedures in Standard Methods 12 
 rotein concentration and total ammonia nitrogen ammonia were determined using the Kjeldahl method 12 
 fter an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction PCR were performed denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s annealing at 57 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min , followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min 
 eads with low nucleotidequality scores < 20 , short sequences < 270-bp , and potentially-chimeric sequences were discarded and MOTHUR with CD-HIT-OTU was used to cluster the remaining sequences that had P 97 % sequence similarity as operational taxonomic units OTUs 
 rocess variables with p < 0.1 were selected and used as the second matrix to construct a Joint NMS ordination plot 
 arbohydrate 24.7 ± 14.8 g/ L 35 % of VS , protein 24.3 ± 9.1 g/L 34 % and lipid 21.3 ± 4.0 g/L 30 % contributed evenly to the organic contents of the FRW Fig . 1a 
 he coefficient of variation CV was 60 % for carbohydrate 32 % for lipid and 32 % for protein 
 hese variations were higher than those of VS 21 % and COD 17 % ; i.e. temporal variations in composition exceeded those in total organic concentration 
 he high CV of carbohydrate content resulted mainly from relatively lower values of carbohydrate contents in summer samples 17 % of VS TC4 and TC8 , compared to spring 29 % , fall 34 % , and winter 54 % samples . TVFA was higher in the summer 19.0 g/L than in other seasons 7.7– 10.9 g/L ( Fig . 1a 
 ipid removal increased as COD removal increased r = 0.907 p < 0.05 , and was more similar to the trend in variation with COD than were carbohydrate and protein removal Fig . 1 ; these results suggest that lipid removal could be the main factor that determines COD removal in the TC digester . Lipid , Na+ , and ammonia in the digester can directly influence process performance and microbial communities in an AD system 19 . Lipid varied more among samples CV = 89 % , than did Na+ ( 36 % , or ammonia ( 23 % ( Fig . 1c 
 or instance COD removal remained above the average 61 % when lipid in the digester was < 5.0 g/L but decreased drastically to 26–44 % when it was > 5.0 g/L Fig . 1b and c 
 OD removal decreased significantly when Na+ in the digester reached 7.1–7.7 g/L e.g. in TC1 TC3 and TC4 ; this response is consistent with a previous report that thermophilic AD was severely inhibited by the presence of 7.8 g Na+/ L 26 
 he total population of bacteria was 1.4  1010 ± 1.5  1010 rRNA gene copies/mL and the total population of archaea was 9.1  107 ± 1.1  108 16S rRNA gene copies/mL Supplementary Fig . 1 and both were positively correlated with variation in COD removal r = 0.782 p < 0.05 and r = 0.664 p < 0.1 respectively but negatively correlated with Na+ and lipid in the digester Supplementary Fig . 1 ; the second of these results suggests that high Na+ and lipid inhibited the growth of both bacteria and archaea , and reduced overall process performance . 3.2.1 
 eads that shared P 97 % similarity in sequences were grouped as OTUs after this preprocess 17 073 reads 2 134 ± 783 reads for each sample remained as rigid reads and were grouped into 116 OTUs for further analysis 
 n this study of 116 OTUs i.e. total number of bacterial OTUs found in this study , 90 78 % were classified into Firmicutes and a large portion of unclassified reads at the class level 92 % belonged to Firmicutes 
 hylum Atribacteria 8 % of total unclassified reads at the class level has no cultivated representatives and is only found in cultivation-independent genomic analyses such as metagenomic analyses 30 
 mong these sixteen genera Tepidanaerobacter Anaerobaculum Defluviitoga Keratinibaculum Gelria Tepidimicrobium Caldicoprobacter Bacillus and Syntrophaceticus were dominant 96 % of the average abundance of classified bacterial genera and each contributing P 1.0 % on average Fig . 2a . 454 pyrosequencing of the eight samples yielded 8 130 nonchimeric archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequence reads 3 822 ( 478 ± 642 reads per sample remained as rigid reads and were grouped into nine OTUs for further analysis 
 ll 3 822 of the archaeal reads were classified into seven methanogen genera Methanoculleus 63.7 ± 44.4 % , Methanobacterium 30.7 ± 40.2 % , Methanolinea 2.2 ± 4.2 % , Methanothermobacter 1.6 ± 4.4 % , Methanospirillum 0.9 ± 2.2 % , Methanogenium 0.9 ± 2.2 % , and Methanosaeta 0.1 ± 0.2 % ( Fig . 2b 
 t the genus level taxonomic resolution was much lower for bacteria 19.6 % than for archaea 100 % ; the difference may occur because bacteria are more diverse than archaea so that 16S rRNA based analysis of bacteria is likely to be more vulnerable to limitations in short-read length of 16S rRNA amplicons in 454 pyrosequencing and incomplete 16S rRNA gene databases 32 . 3.3 
 his speculation is supported by the results that ammonia in the digester was positively correlated with relative abundances of Tepidanaerobacter a genus that includes syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria and that comprised 20.6 ± 15.1 % of total bacteria r = 0.657 p < 0.1 and of Methanobacterium an HM genus that comprised 30.7 ± 40.2 % of total archaea r = 0.829 p < 0.05 . 3.4 
 he correlations were double-checked using Pearson ’ s correlation coefficient at 90 % and 95 % confidence intervals Supplementary Table 1 
 he RDA ordination plot Fig . 4 had model p < 0.05 which means that the model was statistically significant at the 95 % confidence interval and eigenvalue = 0.55 which means that the independent variables explained 55 % of the variance in the response variables 
 n this study the facts that 1 HMs constitute 99.9 % in total methanogens 2 Tepidanaerobacter was the most abundant bacteria genus and ( 3 the average abundance of Tepidanaerobacter was twelve times higher than that of Syntrophaceticus suggest that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis coupled with T. acetatoxydans could be the main metabolic pathway to generate methane by acetate degradation in the TC digester 
 ominant bacteria genera P 1.0 % in relative abundance on average are expressed in bold and underlined . For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this article . 297 Anaerobaculum 19.1 % was the second most-dominant genus and could significantly contribute to carbohydrate removal r = 0.692 p < 0.1 in the TC digester Supplementary Table 1 
 eratinibaculum 8.1 % was the fourth dominant genus it includes one known species Keratinibaculum paraultunense a thermophilic 55 °C as the optimum , slightly halophilic 2 g NaCl/L as the optimum bacterium that uses keratins and other proteins 39 
 aldicoprobacter 2.5 % was the only genus in which the relative abundance was positively correlated with Na+ in the digester r = 0.939 p < 0.05 Fig . 4 Supplementary Table 1 ; i.e. Caldicoprobacter may be halophilic or halotolerant at least within the ranges of 2.9–7.7 Na+ g/L and this is consistent with the characteristics of C. faecale recently reclassified from Acetomicrobium faecale , which is halotolerant ( < 50 g NaCl/L [ 43 
 acterial and archaeal diversity indices were separately quantified based on rigid OTUs P 0.5 % relative abundance in one of eight samples 
 o summarize high Na+ > 7 g Na+/L and high lipid > 5 g lipid/ L might result in decrease of overall bacteria and archaeal functionalities in the thermophilic AD system in turn this repression would reduce COD removal

 ixteen bacterial genera that showed relative abundance > 0.5 % in one of the eight samples were considered high-rank groups Tepidanaerobacter 20.6 ± 15.1 % , Anaerobaculum 19.1 ± 18.6 % , Defluviitoga 10.4 ± 8.9 % , Keratinibaculum 8.1 ± 8.3 % , Gelria 7.9 ± 8.2 % , Tepidimicrobium 3.4 ± 5.0 % , Caldicoprobacter 2.5 ± 1.2 % , Bacillus 1.8 ± 4.4 % , Syntrophaceticus 1.7 ± 2.8 % , Ruminiclostridium 0.6 ± 1.1 % , Lactobacillus 0.4 ± 0.6 % , Halocella 0.3 ± 0.3 % , Proteiniphilum 0.3 ± 0.6 % , Methyloversatilis 0.2 ± 0.3 % , Syntrophomonas 0.2 ± 0.2 % , Haloplasma 0.1 ± 0.3 % ( Fig 2a 
 urthermore the relative abundance of Tepidanaerobacter increased as ammonia increased r = 0.657 p < 0.1 Fig . 4 Supplementary Table 1 ; i.e. Tepidanaerobacter was not inhibited by ammonia within the range of 2.0–4.3 g N/ L ( 0.1–2.0 g free ammonia N/L in the TC digester 
 naerobaculum was abnormally dominant at TC4 60.8 % when NaCl concentration was the highest 10.7 g/L among the samples Fig . 2a , this response is consistent with the observation that A. hydrogeniformans requires high NaCl concentration 10 g/L for optimum growth 
 efluviitoga 10.4 % was the third dominant genus 
 elria 7.9 % was the fifth dominant genus 
 epidimicrobium 3.4 % showed the highest positive correlation with TVFA in the digester r = 0.901 p < 0.05 ( Fig . 4 Supplementary Table 1

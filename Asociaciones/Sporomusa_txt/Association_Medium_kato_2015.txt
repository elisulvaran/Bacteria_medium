www.nature.com/scientificreports  OPEN  received: 19 June 2015 accepted: 24 August 2015 Published: 24 September 2015  Methanogenic degradation of lignin-derived monoaromatic compounds by microbial enrichments from rice paddy field soil Souichiro Kato1,2,3, Kanako Chino4, Naofumi Kamimura4, Eiji Masai4, Isao Yumoto1 & Yoichi Kamagata1,2 Anaerobic degradation of lignin-derived aromatics is an important metabolism for carbon and nutrient cycles in soil environments 
lthough there are some studies on degradation of ligninderived aromatics by nitrate- and sulfate-reducing bacteria, knowledge on their degradation under methanogenic conditions are quite limited 
n this study, methanogenic microbial communities were enriched from rice paddy field soil with lignin-derived methoxylated monoaromatics (vanillate and syringate) and their degradation intermediates (protocatechuate, catechol, and gallate) as the sole carbon and energy sources 
rchaeal community analysis disclosed that both aceticlastic (Methanosarcina sp.) and hydrogenotrophic (Methanoculleus sp. and Methanocella sp.) methanogens dominated in all of the enrichments 
acterial community analysis revealed the dominance of acetogenic bacteria (Sporomusa spp.) only in the enrichments on the methoxylated aromatics, suggesting that Sporomusa spp. initially convert vanillate and syringate into protocatechuate and gallate, respectively, with acetogenesis via O-demethylation 
s the putative ring-cleavage microbes, bacteria within the phylum Firmicutes were dominantly detected from all of the enrichments, while the dominant phylotypes were not identical between enrichments on vanillate/protocatechuate/ catechol (family Peptococcaceae bacteria) and on syringate/gallate (family Ruminococcaceae bacteria) 
his study demonstrates the importance of cooperation among acetogens, ring-cleaving fermenters/ syntrophs and aceticlastic/hydrogenotrophic methanogens for degradation of lignin-derived aromatics under methanogenic conditions.  Lignin is a major component of terrestrial plants and is a highly complex heteropolymer consisting of hydoxylated and methoxylated phenylpropanid units linked by various types of C–C and C–O-C bonds 
s lignin represents a significant part of input of organic compounds, its degradation is integral for carbon and energy cycles in soil environments 
ignin is aerobically depolymerized by lignolytic fungi and some bacterial strains, followed by mineralization of the resulting low-molecular-weight products 1  Bioproduction Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 2-17-2-1 Tsukisamu-Higashi, Toyohira-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 062-8517, Japan. 2Division of Applied Bioscience, Graduate School of Agriculture, Hokkaido University, Kita-9 Nishi-9, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060-8589, Japan. 3 Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-8904, Japan. 4Department of Bioengineering, Nagaoka University of Technology, 1603-1 Kamitomioka, Nagaoka, Niigata 940-2188, Japan

erobic degradation of lignin-derived methoxylated monoaromatics, including vanillate (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate) and syringate (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzoate), has been thoroughly studied4

YK-6 firstly convert vanillate and syringate into protocatechuate (PCA, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate) and 3-O-methylgallate (3-MGA), respectively, by O-demethylation reactions5 
CA is oxidatively decomposed to pyruvate and oxaloacetate via the PCA 4,5-cleavage pathway6. 3-MGA is degraded through multiple ring cleavage pathways and the resultant metabolites are further degraded via the PCA 4,5-cleavage pathway7 
n the contrary, studies on anaerobic degradation of lignin and lignin-derived aromatics have been limited, despite some studies suggesting that their anaerobic biodegradation was evident in various natural environments8–13 
cetogenic bacteria are the first anaerobes described to utilize methoxylated aromatics as the sole carbon and energy sources14,15 
cetogenic bacteria utilize the O-methyl group as the carbon and energy sources, while they do not have the ability to degrade the aromatic ring structure 
imilarly, some sulfate-reducing bacteria and fermentative bacteria utilize the O-methyl group as carbon and energy sources, and a part of them also have ability to decompose the aromatic rings16–19 
naerobic degradation of the O-demethylated derivatives of vanillate and syringate, namely PCA and gallate (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate), respectively, has been documented with nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing, and fermentative bacteria 
 nitrate-reducer Thauera aromatica and a sulfate-reducer Desulfobacterium sp. were reported to anaerobically degrade PCA via the benzoyl-CoA pathway20,21 
ermentative bacteria, such as Eubacterium oxidoreducens and Pelobacter acidigallici, were reported to anaerobically degrade gallate via the phloroglucinol pathway22,23 
hile methanogenesis is one of the most important microbial metabolisms in diverse anaerobic environments, including soil and freshwater/marine sediments, knowledge on methanogenic degradation of lignin-derived aromatics, especially on microorganisms responsible for the decomposition, has been quite limited 
aiser and Hanselmann reported that microbial communities enriched from anaerobic sediments completely degraded lignin-derived aromatics, including vanillate and syringate, with concomitant generation of CH4 (ref. 24) 
owever, microorganisms participating in the O-demethylation and following ring-cleavage reactions under methanogenic environments were not identified 
n the present study, we enriched methanogenic microbial communities from rice paddy field soil with either lignin-derived aromatics (vanillate and syringate) or a model aromatic compound (benzoate) as the sole carbon and energy sources 
he microbial communities were further enriched on the degradation intermediate compounds, namely PCA, catechol, and gallate 
icroorganisms involved in methanogenic degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics were then identified with microbial community analysis based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences.  Results and Discussion  Enrichment of methanogenic microbial communities on lignin-derived aromatics 
he amounts of CH4 produced from 5 mM of benzoate, vanillate, and syringate were 17.1 ±  0.5, 18.4 ±  0.3, and 20.1 ±  0.3 mmol l−1, respectively, and were approximate to the theoretical values (18.75, 20, and 22.5 mmol l−1, respectively) calculated from the following equations:  C 7H5O 2−(benzoate) + 7.75H 2O → 3.75CH 4 + 3.25HCO3− + 2.25H +, C 8H7O 4−(vanillate) + 8H 2O → 4CH 4 + 4HCO3− + 3H +, C 9H9O5−(syringate) + 8.5H 2O → 4.5CH 4 + 4.5HCO3− + 3.5H +

n the benzoate enrichment cultures, no aromatic compound other than benzoate were detected (data not shown), suggesting that benzoate is firstly converted to benzoyl-CoA and then the ring structure is reductively cleaved via benzoyl-CoA pathway as reported25,26.  Enrichment cultures on the degradation intermediates 
n order to further elucidate the mechanisms for degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics, the enrichment cultures on vanillate and syringate were subjected to further enrichments with respective degradation intermediates 
nrichment cultures on PCA and gallate were constructed with vanillate- and syringate-enrichments as the inoculum, respectively, and generated considerable amounts of CH4 within 40 days (Fig. 3A)

n this case, methanogenesis started with approximately a 20-day lag phase and plateaued at around 40 days of cultivation (Fig. 3B)

hese results suggest that methanogenic microbial communities that completely degrade the respective intermediates of vanillate and syringate were successfully enriched.  Dominant microorganisms in the enrichment cultures 
he summarized features of the bacterial and archaeal community analyses are presented in Fig. 4 
ll phylotypes detected from each enrichment culture are listed in Tables S1 and S2 
nly 4 archaeal phylotypes were recovered from the enrichment cultures (Fig. 4A and Table S1) 
he phylotypes classified as hydrogenotrophic methanogens, namely the phylotype ArA-02 (97.9% identity to Methanoculleus palmolei) and ArA-03 (97.5% identity to Methanocella arvoryzae), were also detected from all enrichment cultures 
hese results suggest that both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis contribute to methanogenic degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics 
he predominant bacterial phylotype in the benzoate-enrichments was the phylotype ArB-25 (Fig. 4B and Table S2), which is classified into the class Deltaproteobacteria and has 99.0% identity to Syntrophus aciditrophicus

nstead, the phylotypes classified into phylum Firmicutes dominated in the enrichments supplemented with the lignin-derived aromatics and their degradation intermediates (Fig. 4B) 
mong the Firmicutes phylotypes, the phylotype ArB-01 (99.6% identity to Sporomusa sphaeroides) and ArB-02 (89.8% identity to Sporomusa paucivorans) were abundantly detected from vanillate- and syringate-enrichments, but not from enrichments with their degradation intermediates 
poromusa spp. were reported to have the ability to acetogenetically grow on diverse array of methoxylated aromatic compounds, such as vanillate, ferulate, and 3,4-dimethoxybenzoate, via respective O-demethylation reactions29,30 
hese findings suggested that Sporomusa spp. contribute to the initial step of anaerobic degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics in the enrichments, namely the conversion of vanillate and syringate into PCA and gallate, respectively 
n the enrichments on vanillate and its degradation intermediates (PCA and catechol), the phylotypes classified into family Peptococcaceae were dominant, while the dominant phylotypes varied among the supplemented aromatic compounds (Fig. 4B and Table S2) 
he phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences of representative Peptococcaceae isolates and the Peptococcaceae phylotypes detected in this study is shown in Fig. 5A 
he dominant phylotypes ArB-04 (96.8% identity to Pelotomaculum schinkii) and ArB-06 (98.4% identity to Cryptanaerobacter phenolicus) were clustered into the Desulfotomaculum subcluster Ih31 
urthermore, Desulfotomaculum subcluster Ih includes some strains that syntrophically degrade a range of aromatic compounds33,34 and was frequently detected as the dominant Scientific Reports | 5:14295 | DOI: 10.1038/srep14295  6  www.nature.com/scientificreports/  Figure 6 
he proposed models for methanogenic degradation of vanillate (A) and syringate (B) in the enrichment cultures 
he other dominant phylotype ArB-05 (97.9% identity to Desulfosporosinus auripigmenti) was separately clustered from ArB-04 and -06 and affiliated with genus Desulfosporosinus (Fig. 5A) 
esulfosporosinus spp. were generally characterized as sulfate-reducing bacteria and its syntrophic metabolism with methanogens has not been tested39 
he phylotypes classified into family Ruminococcaceae were dominant in the enrichments with syringate and gallate (Fig. 4B and Table S2) 
ne of the phylotypes, ArB-08, was not clustered with known Ruminococcaceae isolates and has only quite low 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to isolated microorganisms (92.0% identity to Acetivibrio sp. 6–13) 
ost notably, Sporobacter termitidis grows exclusively on a limited range of methoxylated aromatic compounds, including syringate and vanillate, through their O-demethylation and ring cleavage17 
hese reports support the assumption that the Ruminococcaceae phylotypes dominant in the syringate- and gallate-enrichments mainly contributed to their ring cleavage.  Proposed model for methanogenic degradation of vanillate and syringate 
nalysis on degradation intermediates and microbial communities in the enrichments suggested that vanillate is firstly converted into PCA by Sporomusa spp. with acetate generation via O-demethylation reactions (Fig. 6A) 
eptococcaceae bacteria (Desulfotomaculum subcluster Ih and/or Desulfosporosinus spp.) are the plausible candidates for decomposing PCA into acetate and H2/CO2, which are the substrates for methanogenesis by aceticlastic methanogens (Methanosarcina spp.) and hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanoculleus and Methanocella spp.), respectively 
naerobic degradation of PCA has been investigated for some Scientific Reports | 5:14295 | DOI: 10.1038/srep14295  7  www.nature.com/scientificreports/ nitrate- and sulfate-reducing bacteria20,21, by which PCA is firstly activated to protocatechuyl-CoA and reductively dehydroxylated to 3-HB-CoA, followed by ring cleavage via the (3-hydroxy)benzoyl-CoA pathway 
nstead, catechol and 3-HB were detected as the possible intermediate compounds through degradation of PCA (Fig. 2A) 
lthough there have been no reports on microbial enzymes that dehydroxylate PCA into 3-HB under anoxic conditions, it might be possible that certain bacteria utilize such reaction followed by CoA activation and ring cleavage via (3-hydroxy)benzoyl-CoA pathway 
ome nitrate- and sulfate-reducing bacteria were reported to decompose catechol20,50 
hese bacteria initially convert catechol into PCA by carboxylation, followed by activation with CoA-ligation, dehydroxylation and reductive ring cleavage via the (3-hydroxy)benzoyl-CoA pathway 
lthough there are some reports on anaerobic degradation of catechol under methanogenic conditions51–53, the responsible microorganisms and the degradation pathway were not identified 
he demethoxylated product, gallate, seems to be further decomposed into acetate and H2/CO2 mainly by Ruminococcaceae bacteria 
naerobic degradation of gallate were reported for some fermenting bacteria, including E. oxidoreducens, which is classified into Firmicutes and distantly related to the Ruminococcaceae phylotypes detected in this study22,23 
n this study, we successfully enriched methanogenic microbial communities that decompose the lignin-derived monoaromatics, namely syringate and vanillate 
he resultant demethoxylated aromatics were decomposed into acetate and H2/CO2 by Firmicutes bacteria, while the bacterial groups responsible for PCA (family Peptococcaceae) and gallate (family Ruminococcaceae) were not identical 
inally, both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens generate methane from acetate and H2/CO2, respectively 
lthough the details in the pathway of aromatic ring cleavage have not been characterized, isolation of aromatics-degrading Peptococcaceae and Ruminococcaceae strains identified in this study followed by genomic and enzymatic studies will shed light on novel aspects of methanogenic degradation of lignin-derived aromatics in anaerobic environments.  Methods  Enrichment cultures of methanogenic microbial communities 
ethanogenic microbial com-  munities were enriched in serum bottles (68 ml in capacity) filled with 20 ml of a bicarbonate- and HEPES-buffered freshwater basal medium (pH 7.0)54 supplemented with aromatic compounds (benzoate, vanillate, or syringate) as a substrate 
nrichment cultures on PCA/catechol and gallate were constructed in the same medium with the vanillate- and syringate-enrichments as the inoculum, respectively 
fter more than three passages, the enrichment cultures were subjected to chemical and phylogenetic analyses 
o identify metabolic intermediates, the authentic compounds and supernatant of enrichment cultures were analyzed by HPLC (ACQUITY UPLC system, Waters) coupled with ESI-MS (ACQUITY TQ detector, Waters) using a TSKgel ODS-140HTP column (2.1 by 100 mm, Tosoh) as described previously57 
egradation products of vanillate and syringate were detected at the wavelength of 220 nm and 270 nm, respectively 
avelength for the detection and the retention times of authentic compounds were described in Figs S2 and S3 
n the ESI-MS analysis, mass spectra were obtained by negative and positive modes with the following settings: capillary voltage, 3.0 kv; cone voltage, 10 to 40 V; source temperature, 120 °C; desolvation temperature, 350 °C; desolvation gas flow rate, 650 liter h−1; and cone gas flow rate, 50 liter h−1 
CR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments for clone library analyses was conducted as described previously58, with primer sets of U515f and U1492r for bacteria and A25f and A958r for archaea59

hey demonstrated that the first step for methanogenic degradation is acetate production with O-demethylation of the methoxy-group 
ither lignin-derived methoxylated aromatics (5 mM of vanillate or syringate) or a control aromatic compound (5 mM of benzoate) were supplemented as the substrates 
fter several weeks of cultivation, CH4 was produced in all of the cultures supplemented with aromatics (Fig 
n the contrary, only trace amount of CH4 (less than 0.1 mmol l−1) was produced in the cultures without supplementation of the aromatics (Fig 
1), indicating that most of CH4 produced in the enrichment cultures was derived from degradation of aromatic compounds 
roduction of CH4 from the aromatic compounds by respective enrichments (after five successive subcultures) are shown in Fig. 1A–C 
cetate accumulated in the enrichment cultures to 8 to 12 mM during methanogenesis, followed by the complete consumption of the accumulated acetate (Fig. 1A–C), indicating that acetate is one of the important intermediates of methanogenic degradation of the aromatic compounds 
n the vanillate enrichment cultures, two peaks (compound I, II) appeared at day 10, followed by an appearance of another peak (compound III) at day 24 (Fig. 2A) 
atechol (filled triangles, (B)) was supplemented with 1 M at the time points represented by arrows 
eneration of PCA at day 10 suggests that O-demethylation of vanillate is the first step of vanillate degradation 
lthough enrichment cultures on catechol was also constructed using the vanillate-enrichments as the inoculum, the cultures supplemented with 5 mM catechol produced only little amounts of CH4 with a long lag time (> 50 days, data not shown) 
ince cytotoxicity of relatively high concentration of catechol was considered as the reason for the low methanogenic activity, another set of enrichment cultures was constructed with Scientific Reports | 5:14295 | DOI: 10.1038/srep14295  4  www.nature.com/scientificreports/  Figure 4 
fter saturation of methanogenesis, another 1 mM of catechol was added to the culture, which resulted in resumption of methanogenesis with almost no lag time 
icrobial community structures of the enrichments were assessed based on 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis to elucidate the microorganisms participating in methanogenic degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics 
he phylotype ArA-01 (98.9% identity to Methanosarcina vacuolata), which dominated in all enrichment cultures, was the only phylotype classified as an aceticlastic methanogen 
n the benzoate-enrichment cultures, Syntrophus sp. appears to Scientific Reports | 5:14295 | DOI: 10.1038/srep14295  5  www.nature.com/scientificreports/  Figure 5 
he phylotypes dominantly detected from the enrichment cultures are indicated by bold letters 
y contrast, almost no Deltaproteobacteria were recovered from the enrichment cultures with other aromatic compounds 
icroorganisms in the Desulfotomaculum subcluster Ih were characterized by their ability to anaerobically metabolize various organic substrates in syntrophic association with hydrogenotrophic methanogens32 
owever, all crucial domains for syntrophic metabolisms were found in the genome of Desulfosporosinus meridiei, suggesting their possible ability to grow in syntrophic association with methanogens40 
aken together, it is very likely that the Peptococcaceae phylotypes mainly contributed to the ring-cleavage of the vanillate and/or its degradation intermediates via syntrophic interaction with hydrogenotrophic methanogens 
he other dominant phylotype ArB-09 (97.1% identity to Intestinimonas butyriciproducens) was placed within the “Clostridium cluster IV44,45” 
lthough the closest relative of ArB09 (I. butyriciproducens) has not been reported to degrade aromatic compounds46, some strains in the Clostridium cluster IV were reported to fermentatively decompose diverse aromatic compounds 
or example, Flavonifractor plautii (formerly Clostridium orbiscindens) has the ability to degrade flavonoids via phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) as the intermediate47 
he proposed  models for methanogenic degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics are shown in Fig. 6 
owever, we could not confirm the existence of this degradation pathway in the enrichment cultures, because CoA-derivatives of aromatic compounds could not be detected by our analytical protocol 
s in the case of vanillate, the first step of syringate degradation appears to be acetogenic O-demethylation catalyzed by Sporomusa spp. (Fig. 6B) 
. oxidoreducens initially converts gallate into trihydroxybenzene by decarboxylation reaction, followed by ring cleavage via the phloroglucinol pathway22 
lthough the decarboxylated products of gallate were not detected in this study, it is highly possible that the trihydroxybenzene degradation is much faster than its generation.  Concluding remarks 
his study is the first to demonstrate that cooperation of microorganisms with a diverse range of trophic groups are required for methanogenic degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics 
he initial step appears to be catalyzed by Sporomusa spp. that generate acetate via O-demethylation of the methoxylated aromatics

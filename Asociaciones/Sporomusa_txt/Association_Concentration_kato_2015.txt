 he amounts of CH4 produced from 5 mM of benzoate vanillate and syringate were 17.1 ± 0.5 18.4 ± 0.3 and 20.1 ± 0.3 mmol l−1 respectively and were approximate to the theoretical values 18.75 20 and 22.5 mmol l−1 respectively calculated from the following equations C 7H5O 2− benzoate + 7.75H 2O → 3.75CH 4 + 3.25HCO3− + 2.25H + C 8H7O 4− vanillate + 8H 2O → 4CH 4 + 4HCO3− + 3H + C 9H9O5− syringate + 8.5H 2O → 4.5CH 4 + 4.5HCO3− + 3.5H + 
 roduction of CH4 filled circles and acetate open squares were monitored during the incubation of respective enrichment cultures supplemented with 5 mM of benzoate A , vanillate B , or syringate C 
 he cultures were incubated with 5 mM of vanillate A or syringate B and portions of the enrichments were corrected at the start day 10 and day 24 or at the start day 3 and day 10 , respectively 
 he supernatant of enrichment of vanillate and syringate were analyzed by HPLC with detection at 220 nm and 270 nm respectively 
 he retention times of compound I II III IV and V were 1.43 2.40 3.34 1.53 and 0.98 min respectively 
 CA open squares A and gallate ( filled circles ( A ) ) were supplemented with 5 mM at day 0 
 nrichment cultures on PCA and gallate were constructed with vanillate- and syringate-enrichments as the inoculum respectively and generated considerable amounts of CH4 within 40 days Fig . 3A 
 he dominant phylotypes > 10 % in at least one enrichment and their closest relatives sequence identity % are shown in the legends . supplementation of 1 mM catechol 
 n this case methanogenesis started with approximately a 20-day lag phase and plateaued at around 40 days of cultivation Fig . 3B 
 he amount of CH4 produced from PCA 5 mM gallate 5 mM and catechol 1 mM were 15.5 ± 0.5 14.4 ± 0.5 and 2.8 ± 0.3 mmol l−1 respectively and were approximate to the theoretical values 16.25 15 and 3.25 mmol l−1 respectively calculated from the following equations C 7H5O 4− PCA + 7.25H 2O → 3.25CH 4 + 3.75HCO3− + 2.75H + , C 7H5O5− gallate + 7H 2O → 3CH 4 + 4HCO3− + 3H + , C 6H6O 2 catechol + 6.25H 2O → 3.25CH 4 + 2.75HCO3− + 2.75H + 
 he phylotypes classified as hydrogenotrophic methanogens namely the phylotype ArA-02 97.9 % identity to Methanoculleus palmolei and ArA-03 97.5 % identity to Methanocella arvoryzae , were also detected from all enrichment cultures 
 he predominant bacterial phylotype in the benzoate-enrichments was the phylotype ArB-25 Fig . 4B and Table S2 , which is classified into the class Deltaproteobacteria and has 99.0 % identity to Syntrophus aciditrophicus 
 he bar indicates 2 % sequence divergence . decompose benzoate into acetate and H2/CO2 which is further converted into CH4 by aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens 
 mong the Firmicutes phylotypes the phylotype ArB-01 99.6 % identity to Sporomusa sphaeroides and ArB-02 89.8 % identity to Sporomusa paucivorans were abundantly detected from vanillate- and syringate-enrichments but not from enrichments with their degradation intermediates 
 he dominant phylotypes ArB-04 96.8 % identity to Pelotomaculum schinkii and ArB-06 98.4 % identity to Cryptanaerobacter phenolicus were clustered into the Desulfotomaculum subcluster Ih31 
 he other dominant phylotype ArB-05 97.9 % identity to Desulfosporosinus auripigmenti was separately clustered from ArB-04 and -06 and affiliated with genus Desulfosporosinus Fig . 5A 
 ne of the phylotypes ArB-08 was not clustered with known Ruminococcaceae isolates and has only quite low 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to isolated microorganisms 92.0 % identity to Acetivibrio sp . 6–13 
 ethanogenic microbial com- munities were enriched in serum bottles 68 ml in capacity filled with 20 ml of a bicarbonate- and HEPES-buffered freshwater basal medium pH 7.0 54 supplemented with aromatic compounds benzoate vanillate or syringate as a substrate 
 egradation products of vanillate and syringate were detected at the wavelength of 220 nm and 270 nm respectively 
 n the ESI-MS analysis mass spectra were obtained by negative and positive modes with the following settings capillary voltage 3.0 kv cone voltage 10 to 40 V source temperature 120 °C desolvation temperature 350 °C desolvation gas flow rate 650 liter h−1 and cone gas flow rate 50 liter h−1 
 ither lignin-derived methoxylated aromatics 5 mM of vanillate or syringate or a control aromatic compound 5 mM of benzoate were supplemented as the substrates 
 fter several weeks of cultivation CH4 was produced in all of the cultures supplemented with aromatics Fig 
 cetate accumulated in the enrichment cultures to 8 to 12 mM during methanogenesis followed by the complete consumption of the accumulated acetate Fig . 1A–C , indicating that acetate is one of the important intermediates of methanogenic degradation of the aromatic compounds 
 n the vanillate enrichment cultures two peaks compound I II appeared at day 10 followed by an appearance of another peak compound III at day 24 Fig . 2A 
 atechol filled triangles ( B ) was supplemented with 1 M at the time points represented by arrows 
 eneration of PCA at day 10 suggests that O-demethylation of vanillate is the first step of vanillate degradation 
 lthough enrichment cultures on catechol was also constructed using the vanillate-enrichments as the inoculum the cultures supplemented with 5 mM catechol produced only little amounts of CH4 with a long lag time > 50 days data not shown 
 ince cytotoxicity of relatively high concentration of catechol was considered as the reason for the low methanogenic activity another set of enrichment cultures was constructed with Scientific Reports | 5:14295 | DOI 10.1038/srep14295 4 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Figure 4 
 fter saturation of methanogenesis another 1 mM of catechol was added to the culture which resulted in resumption of methanogenesis with almost no lag time 
 he phylotype ArA-01 98.9 % identity to Methanosarcina vacuolata which dominated in all enrichment cultures , was the only phylotype classified as an aceticlastic methanogen 
 he other dominant phylotype ArB-09 97.1 % identity to Intestinimonas butyriciproducens was placed within the “ Clostridium cluster IV44,45 ” 
 hen methanogenesis reached a plateau 0.5 ml of culture solution was transferred to the fresh media

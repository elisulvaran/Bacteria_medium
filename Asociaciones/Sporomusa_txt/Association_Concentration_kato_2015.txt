he effects of elevated CO2 concentration on competitive interaction between aceticlastic and syntrophic methanogenesis in a model microbial consortium 
 he amounts of CH4 produced from 5 mM of benzoate, vanillate, and syringate were 17.1 ±  0.5, 18.4 ±  0.3, and 20.1 ±  0.3 mmol l−1, respectively, and were approximate to the theoretical values (18.75, 20, and 22.5 mmol l−1, respectively) calculated from the following equations:  C 7H5O 2−(benzoate) + 7.75H 2O → 3.75CH 4 + 3.25HCO3− + 2.25H +, C 8H7O 4−(vanillate) + 8H 2O → 4CH 4 + 4HCO3− + 3H +, C 9H9O5−(syringate) + 8.5H 2O → 4.5CH 4 + 4.5HCO3− + 3.5H + 
 roduction of CH4 (filled circles) and acetate (open squares) were monitored during the incubation of respective enrichment cultures supplemented with 5 mM of benzoate (A), vanillate (B), or syringate (C) 
 he cultures were incubated with 5 mM of vanillate (A) or syringate (B), and portions of the enrichments were corrected at the start, day 10, and day 24 or at the start, day 3, and day 10, respectively 
 he supernatant of enrichment of vanillate and syringate were analyzed by HPLC with detection at 220 nm and 270 nm, respectively 
 CA (open squares, (A)) and gallate (filled circles, (A)) were supplemented with 5 mM at day 0 
 nrichment cultures on PCA and gallate were constructed with vanillate- and syringate-enrichments as the inoculum, respectively, and generated considerable amounts of CH4 within 40 days (Fig. 3A) 
 he dominant phylotypes (>10% in at least one enrichment) and their closest relatives (sequence identity, %) are shown in the legends.  supplementation of 1 mM catechol 
 n this case, methanogenesis started with approximately a 20-day lag phase and plateaued at around 40 days of cultivation (Fig. 3B) 
 ethanogenic microbial com-  munities were enriched in serum bottles (68 ml in capacity) filled with 20 ml of a bicarbonate- and HEPES-buffered freshwater basal medium (pH 7.0)54 supplemented with aromatic compounds (benzoate, vanillate, or syringate) as a substrate 
 egradation products of vanillate and syringate were detected at the wavelength of 220 nm and 270 nm, respectively 
 n the ESI-MS analysis, mass spectra were obtained by negative and positive modes with the following settings: capillary voltage, 3.0 kv; cone voltage, 10 to 40 V; source temperature, 120 °C; desolvation temperature, 350 °C; desolvation gas flow rate, 650 liter h−1; and cone gas flow rate, 50 liter h−1 
 ither lignin-derived methoxylated aromatics (5 mM of vanillate or syringate) or a control aromatic compound (5 mM of benzoate) were supplemented as the substrates 
 fter several weeks of cultivation, CH4 was produced in all of the cultures supplemented with aromatics (Fig 
 cetate accumulated in the enrichment cultures to 8 to 12 mM during methanogenesis, followed by the complete consumption of the accumulated acetate (Fig. 1A–C), indicating that acetate is one of the important intermediates of methanogenic degradation of the aromatic compounds 
 n the vanillate enrichment cultures, two peaks (compound I, II) appeared at day 10, followed by an appearance of another peak (compound III) at day 24 (Fig. 2A) 
 atechol (filled triangles, (B)) was supplemented with 1 M at the time points represented by arrows 
 eneration of PCA at day 10 suggests that O-demethylation of vanillate is the first step of vanillate degradation 
 lthough enrichment cultures on catechol was also constructed using the vanillate-enrichments as the inoculum, the cultures supplemented with 5 mM catechol produced only little amounts of CH4 with a long lag time (> 50 days, data not shown) 
 ince cytotoxicity of relatively high concentration of catechol was considered as the reason for the low methanogenic activity, another set of enrichment cultures was constructed with Scientific Reports | 5:14295 | DOI: 10.1038/srep14295  4  www.nature.com/scientificreports/  Figure 4 
 fter saturation of methanogenesis, another 1 mM of catechol was added to the culture, which resulted in resumption of methanogenesis with almost no lag time 
 hen methanogenesis reached a plateau, 0.5 ml of culture solution was transferred to the fresh media

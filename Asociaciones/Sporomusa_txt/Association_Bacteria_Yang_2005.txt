f these, most can only dehalogenate PCE to cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE), such as Dehalobacter restrictus, Sulfurospirillum multivorans (previously Dehalospirillum multivorans (Luijten et al., 2003)), Desulfuromonas chloroethenica, Desulfuromonas michiganensis, and some Desulfitobacterium species; only Dehalococcoides species were identiﬁed as organisms capable of complete dehalogenation of PCE (Dehalococcoides ethenogenes) or cDCE/vinyl chloride (VC) (Dehalococcoides sp 
o date Desulfuromonas species are the only known organisms capable of using acetate as electron donor for PCE dehalogenation to cDCE (Krumholz et al., 1996; Krumholz, 1997; Sung et al., 2003)

haracterization of two tetrachloroethene-reducing, acetate-oxidizing anaerobic bacteria and their description as Desulfuromonas michiganensis sp. nov 
 basal medium (Yang and McCarty, 1998) supplemented with 1.7 mM sodium benzoate, 20 mg/L yeast extract, and 0.98 mM PCE was added to the chemostat using a syringe pump at a rate of 50 mL/day, resulting in a 38day retention time 
he PCR cocktail contained 0.2 mM of each primer, 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleotide (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland), 2 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mg mL1 bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland), 1 U of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), 1 mL of DNA extract, and 1  PCR reaction buffer in a ﬁnal volume of 50 mL 
NA from band 1 was found to share 100% sequence similarity to the 16S rDNA of uncultured Dehalococcoides species (Table 2), slightly different (1 bp difference in 170 bp) from that of D. ethenogenes strain 195 
and 4 was present in ﬁngerprints of both acetate/PCE and acetate/cDCE subcultures and its DNA sequence was 100% similar to an uncultured Dehalococcoides species and was afﬁliated with the same phylotype as band 1 from communities grown with hydrogen as electron  99 100 99 96 100 99  donor (Table 2)

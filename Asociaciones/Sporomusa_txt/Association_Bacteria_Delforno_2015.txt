mong the analyzed sequences, 0.16–10.79% of the sequences were related to the following genera that perform desulfonation reactions: Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Comamonas, Desulfovibrio, Hydrogenophaga and Pseudomonas 
nly Pseudomonas has the ability to perform both b- and x-oxidation, in addition to desulfonation 
hus, Pseudomonas plays a necessary role in the microbial consortium that mineralizes LAS (Brenner et al., 2005).  T.P 
ynthetic medium The reactor was fed with a modiﬁed mineral medium (an adjusted MgCl2 concentration of 25 mg L1; Angelidaki et al., 1990), vitamins (Touzel and Albagnac, 1983), sodium bicarbonate (400 mg L1) and a mixture of co-substrates, which consisted of ethanol (250 mg COD L1), methanol (250 mg COD L1) and yeast extract (250 mg COD L1). 2.4 
he organic components that comprised the SOLR were methanol, ethanol and yeast extract in the synthetic medium 
ith the purpose of ensuring anaerobic systems, two procedures were adopted: the use of a water seal and the use of a siphon at the outlet of the system, which prevented the entry of oxygen via hose efﬂuent 
herefore, previous studies have reported several problems associated with inappropriate disposal of wastewater contaminated with LAS, including dispersing pollution, foaming in rivers, oxygen diffusion problems, inhibition of microorganisms with regard to natural depuration and others (Garcia et al., 2005)

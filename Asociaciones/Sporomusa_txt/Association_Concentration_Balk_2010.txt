 he assay mixture was prereduced by a small amount of a dithionite solution (0.2 M) until an absorbance of 1.5 was reached, and then the reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of chlorate (0.4 M) or perchlorate (0.4 M) 
 ey enzymes, perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase, were detected in cell-free extracts.  The GenBank accession number for the 16S rRNA sequence of Sporomusa sp. is EF060193 M 
 erial dilutions of the sample from the underground gas storage were prepared in liquid media containing 20 mM of methanol and 10 mM of perchlorate 
 herefore, the assessment of perchlorate concentration was semi-quantitative 
 he EMBL database accession numbers of the strain most closely related to strain An4 is S. ovata (DSM 2662) (98% sequence similarity).  Enzyme assays Cell extracts used for enzyme assays were obtained from cells grown in the medium supplemented with 20 mM of methanol and 10 mM of perchlorate

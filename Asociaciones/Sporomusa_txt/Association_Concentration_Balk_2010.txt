 uring growth with perchlorate the medium became pink due to the presence of resorufin formed from resazurin upon deoxygenation and when all the per chlorate was consumed the pink color disappeared again 
 esting per chlorate reduction by other members of the genus Sporomusa The ability of Sporomusa species S. ovata =DSM 2662 and S. aerivorans =DSM 13326 to reduce perchlorate was tested either with lactate or with methanol 
 oth substrates Table 4 Fatty acid composition of strain An4 in comparison to related species Fig . 3 Growth and lactate utilization by strain An4 in the absence of per chlorate a and in the presence of perchlorate b and chlorate c 
 rowth of these two strains in the medium with per chlorate did not result in a change of product formation with lactate as a substrate which was the case for strain An4 Fig . 3 Table 2 
 robably ( per chlorate utilization inhibited further fermentative growth with the remaining lactate 
 urrently we do not know the genes encoding per chlorate reduction and chlorite dismutation 
 he isolation of strain An4 suggests that many other bacteria might be capable of per chlorate reduction than have been considered up to now

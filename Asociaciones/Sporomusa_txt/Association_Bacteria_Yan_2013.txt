nhanced Dehalococcoides growth and faster dechlorination rates were observed in co- or tri-cultures of D. mccartyi strain 195 and corrinoid-producers such as Acetobacterium woodii, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough, suggesting that strain 195 benefited from the corrinoids produced in the co-cultures [13,14]

(d) Corrinoid measurements (i) Microbiological B12 assay Quantification of extracellular cobamides in pure and co-cultures was performed using a microbiological assay with Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis (ATCC 7830) as the cobamide-auxotroph test organism following described procedures [15] 
hese findings are supported by a previous study that reported that D. mccartyi strain 195 reductive dechlorination activity was not enhanced in co-cultures with Methanobacterium congolense [14] 
lthough the specific cobamides produced by Methanobacterium congolense and many other methanogens have not been thoroughly explored, the data reported here confirm that at least the 50 -hydroxybenzimidazolyl-cobamide produced by some methanogens cannot fulfil the D. mccartyi corrinoid cofactor requirement 
actor III synthesized by Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was replaced by a cobalamin in medium amended with DMB without affecting methane formation and growth [35]

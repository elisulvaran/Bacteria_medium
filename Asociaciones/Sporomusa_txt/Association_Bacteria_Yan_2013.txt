o explore whether known cobamide-producing microbes supply Dehalococcoides with the required corrinoid cofactor, co-culture experiments were performed with the methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri strain Fusaro and two acetogens, Sporomusa ovata and Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1, as Dehalococcoides partner populations 
uring growth with H2/CO2, M. barkeri axenic cultures produced 4.2 + 0.1 mg l21 extracellular cobamide (factor III), whereas the Sporomusa cultures produced phenolyl- and p-cresolyl-cobamides 
either factor III nor the phenolic cobamides supported Dehalococcoides reductive dechlorination activity suggesting that M. barkeri and the Sporomusa sp. cannot fulfil Dehalococcoides’ nutritional requirements 
ehalococcoides dechlorination activity and growth occurred in M. barkeri and Sporomusa sp. co-cultures amended with 10 mM 50 ,60 -dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB), indicating that a cobalamin is a preferred corrinoid cofactor of strains BAV1, GT and FL2 when grown with chlorinated ethenes as electron acceptors

o extracellular cobamides were detected in the acetate-producing S. ovata (figure 3b) and Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 cultures, which was unexpected because Sporomusa spp. are known cobamide producers  Phil Trans R Soc B 368: 20120320  TCE, cis-DCE, VC and ethene (mmoles per bottle)  (e)  rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org  TCE, cis-DCE, VC and ethene (mmoles per bottle)  (a)  Downloaded from http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/ on February 17, 2018  Table 1 
obamides were also not detected in Sporomusa cell lysates suggesting that Sporomusa produced cobamide(s), to which the indicator organism L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis did not respond (i.e. the cobamide cannot be detected and quantified with the microbiological B12 assay).  (c) Reductive dechlorination in co-cultures In D. mccartyi strain BAV1 and M. barkeri strain Fusaro co-cultures amended with 25 mg l21 CN-Cbl, reductive dechlorination and methane formation occurred concomitantly 
oth S. ovata and Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 grew  in co-cultures lacking CN-Cbl but extracellular cobamides were not detected using the microbiological B12 assay, and only 10.6 + 3.6 and 10.4 + 0.5 mmoles of VC were produced in BAV1/S. ovata and BAV1/Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 co-cultures, respectively (figure 4e,f) 
hese findings demonstrate that Sporomusa sp. were unable to support BAV1 reductive dechlorination activity 
ctivities of D. mccartyi strains GT and FL2 were also tested in the co-cultures with M. barkeri strain Fusaro, S. ovata and Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 
nly insignificant dechlorination of TCE to cis-DCE (less than 0.5% of the initial amount of TCE) occurred in these co-cultures (data not shown).  (d) Guided biosynthesis of cobalamin in Sporomusa The CN-Cbl standard (5 mg l21) eluted at a retention time of 6.94 min (figure 5a) 
PLC separation of cyanocobamides extracted from Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 (figure 5b) and S. ovata (data not shown) cells collected from cultures not amended with DMB yielded two major peaks with retention times of 9.80 and 11.25 min, matching previous reports that two types of cobamides, phenolyl-cobamide and p-cresolylcobamide, were synthesized by S. ovata [26] 
he addition of 10 mM DMB to the culture medium did not affect growth, and Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 cultures reached similar OD 600 nm values of 0.040– 0.041 (data not shown)

oth Sporomusa isolates produced phenolyland p-cresolyl-cobamide, suggesting that they represent the characteristic cobamides of the genus Sporomusa 
he test organism for the microbiological B12 assay, L. delbrueckii, did not respond to S. ovata or Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 culture suspensions or cell lysates, indicating that the cobamides with phenolic lower ligands cannot fulfil the corrinoid cofactor requirement of L. delbrueckii 
ince D. mccartyi genomes harbour multiple copies of class II RNR genes, it is possible that the lack of dechlorination activity and Dehalococcoides growth in the Sporomusa co-cultures was not only caused by non-functional RDases but also because of non-functional RNRs 
n the presence of 10 mM DMB, CN-Cbl was the predominant corrinoid extracted from Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 cultures, indicating that guided biosynthesis allows Sporomusa sp. to generate a corrinoid cofactor that fulfils Dehalococcoides’ nutritional requirements 
n DMB-amended Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 co-cultures with each of the D. mccartyi strains BAV1, GT and FL2, the dechlorinators attained population sizes of 2.1 + 0.2  108, 2.1 + 0.3  108 and 9.0 + 1.4  107 cells per mmole of chloride released, respectively 
ence, it is possible that M. barkeri strain Fusaro and the Sporomusa isolates provided the D. mccartyi strains with not yet identified compounds that enhance growth yields 
he co-culture experiments with D. mccartyi strains demonstrated that the addition of DMB to the medium enabled guided biosynthesis and the formation of a cobalamin by M. barkeri strain Fusaro and Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1

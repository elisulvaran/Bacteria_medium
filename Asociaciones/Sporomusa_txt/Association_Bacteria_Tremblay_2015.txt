nterestingly, a solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida strain also exhibits a similar LPS profile54 suggesting that the modifications in LPS of S. ovata are involved in higher tolerance to methanol

n the laboratory, S. ovata is maintained heterotrophically in a medium amended with 0.1% yeast extract which is known to contain substantial amount of pyrimidine46 
uring the ALE experiment, the minimal medium used for methanol adaptation did not contain yeast extract and thus S. ovata cells had to increase their capacity for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis 
east extract is also an important source of amino acids and thus  it is not surprising that genes involved in biosynthesis of leucine, valine, and tryptophane had higher transcript abundance in met-T18-2 in the absence of yeast extract (Table S1) 
or all growth conditions presented in this study, casitone, sodium sulfide, yeast extract, and resazurin were omitted from the 311 medium 
racil-induced down-regulation of the yeast uracil permease 
utations were detected in ald2, a gene coding for one of the two alanine dehydrogenases of S. ovata, in grd2, a gene coding for a subunit of a glycine reductase and in putP, a gene coding for a sodium/proline symporter 
eside protein synthesis, amino acids like proline, glycine along with its methyl derivatives, and glutamate are compatible solutes that can accumulate into the bacterial cells to confer tolerance to osmotic stress, solvents, and thermal stress51–53 
utations and differential expression of genes participating in the metabolism of the osmoprotectants proline and glycine suggest that the adapted S. ovata is using them to enhance its tolerance to methanol.  Cell wall and transporter.  Development of a higher tolerance to solvent in bacteria has been associated with changes in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) content of the cell envelope54,55

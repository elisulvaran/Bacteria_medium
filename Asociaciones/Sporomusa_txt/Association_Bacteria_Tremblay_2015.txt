www.nature.com/scientificreports OPEN received 05 May 2015 accepted 08 October 2015 Published 04 November 2015 Adaptation of the autotrophic acetogen Sporomusa ovata to methanol accelerates the conversion of CO2 to organic products Pier-Luc Tremblay Daniel HÃ¶glund Anna Koza Ida Bonde & Tian Zhang Acetogens are efficient microbial catalysts for bioprocesses converting C1 compounds into organic products 
ere an adaptive laboratory evolution approach was implemented to adapt Sporomusa ovata for faster autotrophic metabolism and CO2 conversion to organic chemicals 
n this study ALE was employed to develop a strain of the acetogen Sporomusa ovata growing significantly faster on methanol 
recent proteomic study identified the two components of the corrinoid-dependent methyltransferase in the closely-related species Sporomusa strain An442 
ike in Sporomusa stain An4 MtaC of S. ovata is probably involved in the first step of methanol oxidation and its mutation suggests that this protein has been optimized for more efficient methanol oxidation and faster growth 
he reference genome for the analysis was Sporomusa ovata DSM 2662 NCBI accession ASXP00000000.1

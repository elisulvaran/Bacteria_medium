oreover, the Sulfurovum genus is a chemolithoautotroph that uses elemental sulfur or thiosulfate as an electron donor and oxygen and nitrate as electron acceptors, with CO2 as the carbon source (Kleinsteuber et al., 2008) 
hus, the source of LAS was one compound and the source of sulfate was another compound 
itrate and sulfate were quantiﬁed by ion chromatography using a Dionex ICS-5000 with IonPAC AS23 (4 mm) and an eluent of Na2CO3/NaHCO3 (1 mL min1) 
he laundry wastewater analyzed by Braga and Varesche (2014) possessed similar levels of LAS (162 ± 244 mg LAS L1) and COD (1710 ± 968 mg COD L1) but a lower sulfate concentration (7.0 ± 6.4 mg S L1) and a lower pH (5.6 ± 0.9) 
elforno et al., 2014, who analyzed seven samples of laundry wastewater from a commercial laundry located in São Carlos, SP, Brazil, obtained similar values of 181 ± 82 mg LAS L1, 1603 ± 692 mg COD L1 and 124 ± 74 mg S L1 of sulfate 
ccordingly, the sulfate concentration increased (Table 1), resulting in a higher concentration of sulﬁde generated by the sulfate reduction 
 possible relationship was observed between increases in the concentration of S2 in the efﬂuent (due to sulfate in the laundry wastewater) and decreases in surfactant removal 
hese results represent a new challenge in the application of anaerobic reactors for the removal of LAS present in laundry wastewater with high sulfate concentrations 
or example, sulﬁde generated from laundry wastewater rich in sulfate as previously discussed (Section 3.1 – reactor performance) 
n the other hand, there are compounds in laundry wastewater which favor the degradation of the LAS such as sequestrants (e.g., EDTA) due to decrease the amount of LAS adsorbed in the biomass (Delforno et al., 2014; Okada et al., 2014).  Additionally, the reactor was subjected to high inﬂuent sulfate concentrations (30–54 mg S L1) 
herefore, although there is evidence in the literature that the microbial community may have been affected by the presence of toxic compounds during the LAS biodegradation or toxic compounds present in the laundry wastewater, probably, the main modiﬁer of LAS biodegradation and microbial community were metabolized byproducts from sulfate (eg., sulﬁde) 
icrobial composition regarding to sulfur cycle Due to the high concentration of sulfate in the wastewater (205 ± 104 mg S L1), genera associated with the sulfur cycle were highly abundant (4.8%–55.3%; Supplementary Fig. 2) 
he genera related to sulfate reduction include Desulfatirhabdium, Desulfocapsa, Desulfomicrobium, Desulfomonile, Desulforhabdus, Desulfovibrio and Syntrophobacter 
he relative abundance in Stage II ranged from 0.01% to 0.30% in association with an inﬂuent sulfate concentration of 29.2 ± 10.1 mg S L1; whereas the relative abundance in the Stage III ranged from 3.54% to 4.75% in association with an inﬂuent sulfate concentration of 53.8 ± 17.2 mg S L1 
ased on the observations, the primary factor responsible for this lower removal efﬁciency was the increased sulﬁde levels in the reactor due to higher sulfate reduction activity 
naerobic degradation pathway of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) in sulfate reducing marine sediments 
n Stages II and III, the synthetic medium was replaced with diluted laundry wastewater (only the sodium bicarbonate was kept to maintain a neutral pH) at two speciﬁc LAS loading rates (SLLRs): 1.0 ± 0.3 mg LAS gTVS1 d1 (Stage II – 12.0 ± 3.0 mg LAS L1 inﬂuent) and 2.7 ± 0.7 mg LAS gTVS1 d1 (Stage III – 28.8 ± 6.4 mg LAS L1 inﬂuent) 
ynthetic medium The reactor was fed with a modiﬁed mineral medium (an adjusted MgCl2 concentration of 25 mg L1; Angelidaki et al., 1990), vitamins (Touzel and Albagnac, 1983), sodium bicarbonate (400 mg L1) and a mixture of co-substrates, which consisted of ethanol (250 mg COD L1), methanol (250 mg COD L1) and yeast extract (250 mg COD L1). 2.4 
he primary acids detected were lactic acid (168.6 ± 174.8 mg L1) and malic acid (153.6 ± 326.7 mg L1) 
his genus grows chemolithoautotrophically under anoxic conditions by the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds and hydrogen 
nﬂuence of seed sludge and pretreatment method on hydrogen production in packed-bed anaerobic reactors 
his region is favorable due to its greater susceptibility to the presence of oxygen, availability of CO2 and elemental sulfur. 4

heir importance can be seen by the values in the global market (US$ 26.8 billion) and annual production (14,630 thousand tons) in 2012 
mong all surfactants, the anionic surfactants receive special attention due to the high global (2942 thousand tons) and Brazilian (293 thousand tons) production, representing annual prices of US$ 7.5 billion and US$ 0.75 billion, respectively (Frost and Sullivan, 2013 apud Bain & Company and GasEnergy, 2014).  ⇑ Corresponding author 
ll rights reserved.  Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate is the most important anionic surfactant, with large worldwide production due to low-cost production and excellent properties 
ecause of its intense use, LAS can be found in domestic sewage (1–18 mg L1) and laundry wastewater (17–1024 mg L1; Braga and Varesche, 2014; Delforno et al., 2014) 
herefore, previous studies have reported several problems associated with inappropriate disposal of wastewater contaminated with LAS, including dispersing pollution, foaming in rivers, oxygen diffusion problems, inhibition of microorganisms with regard to natural depuration and others (Garcia et al., 2005) 
o minimize these problems, certain studies have focused on LAS removal using physical–chemical treatment (Ge et al., 2004; Sostar-Turk et al., 2005) and anaerobic reactors (Braga and Varesche, 2014; de Oliveira et al., 2010; Delforno et al., 2014; Okada et al., 2014) 
ccordingly, previous studies evaluated the LAS removal in laundry wastewater using ﬂuidized bed reactors (FBR) (Braga and Varesche, 2011), expanded granular sludge bed reactors (EGSB)  38  T.P 
elforno et al. / Bioresource Technology 192 (2015) 37–45  (Delforno et al., 2014) and up-ﬂow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB) (Okada et al., 2014) 
n the FBR and EGSB reactors, the authors used inﬂuent supplementation (e.g., vitamins, co-substrates, or solutions of macro and micronutrients), whereas, in the UASB reactor, the authors operated without supplementation 
he authors aforementioned observed that the concentration of volatile fatty acids and others compounds present in the laundry wastewater can support the microbial activity 
n addition, studies have been applied LAS inﬂuent concentration range from 9.5 ± 3.0 to 23.9 ± 5.0 mg L1 in FBR (Braga and Varesche, 2011) and around 10.0 mg L1 in EGSB and UASB reactor (Delforno et al., 2014; Okada et al., 2014) 
he higher removal rate was 82% and the lower was 68% for UASB and FBR, respectively 
herefore, this study investigated the removal of LAS in commercial laundry wastewater with two speciﬁc LAS loading rates (SLLRs), 1.0 and 2.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1, in an EGSB reactor (12.0 and 29 mg LAS L1 in the inﬂuent, respectively) without supplementary feeding 
he biomass was characterized using two techniques: PCR– DGGE (polymerase chain reaction–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and high-throughput sequencing 
he objective for DGGE was to determine whether a possible microbial stratiﬁcation along the reactor was present, and the goal of the high-throughput sequencing (Ion Torrent Platform) was to identify the microorganisms involved probably in LAS degradation. 2 
GSB – expanded granular sludge bed reactor The reactor consisted of an acrylic apparatus with a volume of 1.40 L, a height of 1.0 m and a diameter of 0.04 m 
t the upper end, there was a device to separate the solid, liquid and gas phases, and at the base, there was a distributor of ﬂow 
ix sampling points were installed along the bed of the reactor, and one was installed on the phase separator 
uring the operation, the reactor was maintained at a mesophilic condition of 30 °C in a climatic chamber and with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 38 h 
ith the purpose of ensuring anaerobic systems, two procedures were adopted: the use of a water seal and the use of a siphon at the outlet of the system, which prevented the entry of oxygen via hose efﬂuent 
hus, in this stage, the reactor was fed with a synthetic medium (Touzel and Albagnac, 1983; Angelidaki et al., 1990) 
uring the washing process two compounds were added, (i) detergents and (ii) neutralizeracidulant 
he detergent composition consisted of LAS, nonionic surfactants, builders, bleaching agents, enzymes, fragrance, neutralizers and alkalizing agents (sodium hydroxide) 
he neutralizer-acidulant consisted of sodium sulfate, sodium metabisulﬁte and an alkaline vehicle 
he wastewater was collected after the ﬁrst rinse in 10 or 20 L high-density polyurethane bottles, and the bottles were stored at a temperature of 4 °C 
n addition, due to the high concentration of LAS in the wastewater and the inhibitory concentration for methanogenic process, the laundry wastewater was diluted in public water supply as a function of LAS concentration determined in each stage 
hysical chemical analysis Analyses of pH (4500), total solids (2540D), total dissolved sulﬁde (4500-S2-.D) and chemical oxygen demand (COD; 5220D) were determined according to the Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA-AWWA-WPCF, 2005) 
olatile fatty acids (VFAs), including caproic, valeric, isovaleric, butyric, isobutyric, propionic, acetic, formic, lactic, succinic, malic and citric acids, were quantiﬁed by HPLC using a Shimadzu system (Controller SCL10AVP, Pump LC-10ADVP, Oven CTO-20A and UV detector SCL10AVP) with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad; Penteado et al., 2013) 
AS was quantiﬁed by HPLC using a Shimadzu system (SCL10AVP, LC-10ADVP, CTO-10A and RF-10AXL) with a reversed-phase C8 column (Supelco) and ﬂuorescence detector (Duarte et al., 2006) .  39  T.P 
esults and discussion  The analysis of the microbial community was performed by PCR–DGGE (domain Bacteria) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene 
he analysis by PCR–DGGE was performed in two ways: (i) the ﬁrst aimed to compare the microbial community of the inoculum and the end of Stages II and III in the reactor 
or this purpose, homogeneous samples of the sludge blanket (SB) (Stages II and III) and the phase separator (PS) (Stages II and III) were sampled. (ii) The second method aimed to evaluate the community at different sampling points in the sludge blanket and the phase separator, thus verifying the existence of a possible microbial stratiﬁcation along the reactor (only Stage III) 
or this purpose, samples were taken from the ﬂow distributor (P1), three sludge blanket sites (P2, P3, and P4) and the phase separator (P5) 
or the phylogenetic characterization of the Bacteria domain, homogeneous samples were taken from the phase separator and the sludge blanket at the end of Stages II and III 
NA extraction Total DNA extraction for PCR–DGGE and 16S rRNA sequencing was performed using a modiﬁed phenol–chloroform protocol described by Grifﬁths et al. (2000) 
he DNA quality was assessed by a standard of 260/280 nm > 1.8, as measured by an ND-2000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Inc., Wilmington, DE) and agarose gel electrophoresis.  2.6.2 
or the Bacteria domain, primers 968F (with a clamp GC) and 1392R (Nübel et al., 1996) were used 
he similarity coefﬁcients were determined according to the Jaccard coefﬁcient, and the dendrogram was determined by an unweighted pair group method with an arithmetic average (UPGMA) algorithm.  2.6.3. 16S rRNA Ion Tag sequencing The sequencing was performed at the GenOne Biotechnologies enterprise (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) using 400-base chemistry and the Ion Torrent PGM technology (Life Technologies), speciﬁcally the 318 Chip 
he rRNA genes were ampliﬁed using a primer set that ﬂanked the V4 hypervariable region: primers 577F (50 -AYTG GGYDTAAAGNG-30 ) and 924R (50 -CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT-30 ), generating an ampliﬁed fragment with an average length of 347 bp 
ccording to Neefs et al. (1990), the 16S rDNA gene is divided into nine variable regions (V1–V9), the V2, V4 and V6 regions are the most used to phylogenetic afﬁliation 
n addition, Liu et al. (2007) observed low error rate for V2 and V4 region 
he conﬁdence threshold adopted was 80% for genus and 50% for other taxonomic levels (phylum-family) 
lfa (Chao1, Shannon, Simpson and Dominance) diversity was quantiﬁed using Past software 
he sequences were submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (http://www.ebi. ac.uk) under the accession numbers ERS629278 (Stage II – PS), ERS629279 (Stage II – SB), ERS629280 (Stage III – SB) and ERS629281 (Stage III – PS) 
he project accession number is PRJEB8003.  In the total, ﬁve samples were taken to analyze the composition of the laundry wastewater (two samples during the Stage II and three samples during the Stage III), the average values found were 119 ± 53 mg LAS L1, 1582 ± 455 mg COD L1 and 205 ± 104 mg S L1 (sulfate) 
he pH ranged from 9.6 to 10.7, and the VFA average was 442 ± 556 mg COD L1 
nterestingly, Braga and Varesche (2014) obtained a peak LAS concentration of 1024 mg L1, whereas the present results only reached 202 mg LAS L1 
oreover, the pH was basic and ranged from 9.0 to 10.0 
he speciﬁc organic loading rate (SOLR) was 69 ± 9 mg COD gVS1 d1 (inﬂuent COD concentration of 755 ± 277 mg L1), and the removal efﬁciency was 89 ± 19% (Table 1) 
he inﬂuent COD was  Table 1 Means and standard deviations of parameters analyzed in EGSB reactor

he COD was related to volatile organic acids, surfactants, ﬁbrous material and recalcitrant compounds present in the wastewater; thus, the lower COD removal was due to a portion of the material that was not readily degradable 
he speciﬁc LAS loading rate (SLLR) in Stage II was 1.0 ± 0.3 mg LAS gVS1 d1 (12.3 ± 3.2 mg LAS L1 inﬂuent), and the average removal was 92.9 ± 10.3% 
elforno et al. (2014), operating an EGSB reactor with a similar SLLR (1.0 ± 0.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1) of laundry wastewater and SOLR (71 ± 13 mg COD gVS1 d1) of synthetic medium, obtained an average of 76.4 ± 18.1% 
robably, the SOLR was the key parameter for obtaining high surfactant removal rates with values of 21 ± 11 and 71 ± 13 mg COD gVS1 d1 for the present study (Stage II) and Delforno et al. (2012), respectively 
he organic components that comprised the SOLR were methanol, ethanol and yeast extract in the synthetic medium 
he difference between Stage II and Stage III was due to the COD related to sulﬁde (Stage II: 1.76 ± 2.33 mg S L1; Stage III: 20.2 ± 25.1 mg S L1) 
he SLLR was 2.7 ± 0.7 mg LAS gSTV1 d1 (LAS inﬂuent: 28.8 ± 6.4 mg L1), and the LAS removal rate decreased to 58.6 ± 25.8% 
uring Stage II, the sulﬁde efﬂuent concentration was not higher than 10 mg S L1, and the LAS removal was greater than 70%.

elforno et al. / Bioresource Technology 192 (2015) 37–45  the sulﬁde concentrations were 9 ± 6 and 62 ± 25 mg S L1, and the LAS removal rates were 50% and 30%, respectively (for LAS inﬂuent concentrations of 32 ± 7 and 30 ± 2 mg LAS L1, respectively) 
n actuality, this susceptibility could be the result of many factors, such as competition for the same substrates between sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and the LAS-removing microbiota, non-competitive inhibition caused by SRB-generated sulﬁde and/or toxicity of S2 
ccording to the mass balance of the total amount of LAS added to the reactor (4460 mg LAS), 7% and 2% were adsorbed to the biomass in the sludge blanket and phase separator, respectively 
iological degradation accounted for 52%, whereas adsorption and biological removal removed 61% 
he mass balance was realized at the end of the reactor operation (Stage II and Stage III), and Stage III showed low LAS removal rates, resulting in a decrease in the percentages of the mass balance. 3.2 
CR/DGGE analyses Based on the biomass DGGE proﬁle taken along the reactor (Fig. 3C and D), the bacterial populations differed as a function of the sampling site 
arger and denser granules were observed at the base of the reactor, and lower density granules were observed in the upper region of the sludge blanket 
 73% similarity existed between the populations of P2 and P3, both of which contained well-deﬁned granules 
owever, a similarity coefﬁcient of only 30% existed between these two groups (i.e., biomass structure in the form of granules (P2 and P3) and ﬂocculent material (P5 and P4) 
he biomass of the phase separator region P5 and P4 exhibited lower similarity coefﬁcients (<34%) when compared to the biomass from the inoculum 
ccording McHugh et al. (2003), two of the main advantages of the microbial granule arrangement are the collective defense with regard to toxic compounds and optimization of the survival of microbial populations 
n the biomass DGGE proﬁles taken at the end of Stages II, III and the inoculum, large-amplitude variations in similarity values and clustering with the operation stages were observed 
he highest similarity coefﬁcient (60%) was between the inoculum and Stage II biomass sludge blanket 
he biomass of the ﬂow distribution (P1) was 52% similar to the points P2 and P3 (granular biomass) and <40% similar to the points P4 and P5 (ﬂocculent biomass)

any of the sequences were removed due to formation of a dimer between the forward and reverse primers, resulting in a fragment of approximately 35 bp (data not shown) 
urthermore, the analyses of the rarefaction curves were used to infer that the phylum taxonomic level (80% similarity) and the number of sequences obtained were sufﬁcient to represent all the diversity in the biomass (Supplementary Fig. 1) 
owever, the rarefaction curves demonstrated that even with a large number of sequences, it was not possible to access the entire diversity at the genus (95%) and species (97%) level 
tabilization of the rarefaction curves did not occur at the genus and species levels 
he values of richness estimators (Chao1) and rarefaction ranged from 3072 to 6214 and 2268–4623, respectively 
he highest values of Chao1 and rarefaction were obtained in Stage II with an SLLR of 1.0 ± 0.3 mg LAS gSTV1 d1, whereas the lowest values were obtained in Stage III with an SLLR of 2.7 ± 0.7 mg LAS gSTV1 d1 
urthermore, the observed Simpson values (1-D) near 1 indicate high diversity and equitable distribution 
his pattern was observed for the biomass in Stage II (PS, SB) and Stage III (PS, SB), which exhibited similarity values of 25% and 45%, respectively 
urthermore, a similarity value of only 10% was observed between the biomass of Stage II and Stage III, a result of the increased concentration of LAS and reactor operation time 
mong the major phyla, the Proteobacteria phylum represented greater than  20% (relative abundance) of the samples from Stage III and 65– 70% of the sludge blanket and phase separator samples 
he 20 most abundant genera, excluding unclassiﬁed ones, represented 99% (Stage II – SB), 84% (Stage II – PS), 93% (Stage III – SB) and 95% (Stage III – PS) of the relative abundances (date not shown) 
ncluding the unclassiﬁed sequences, the values were 15% (Stage II – SB), 24% (Stage II – PS), 50% (Stage III – SB) and 71% (Stage III – PS) 
enera such as Geobacter, Syntrophobacter, Smithella, Phenylobacterium and Legionella were found in four samples (Fig. 5B) 
rom these ﬁve genera, only Geobacter was directly related to the degradation of LAS and/or its intermediaries because this type of Bacteria uses aromatic compounds, such as benzene and toluene, as a carbon source 
eobacter genus is a strict anaerobe and has the metabolic capacity to perform b-oxidation, a step in the LAS degradation (Brenner et al., 2005). 3.3.1 
t is noteworthy that the SLRR between Stage II and Stage III showed statistical difference (ANOVA and the post hoc Tukey, p < 0.05) 
mong the analyzed sequences, 0.16–10.79% of the sequences were related to the following genera that perform desulfonation reactions: Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Comamonas, Desulfovibrio, Hydrogenophaga and Pseudomonas 
f the obtained sequences, 0.36–12.30% were related to the following genera with the metabolic capacity to perform b-oxidation: Azoarcus, Geobacter, Parvibaculum, Pseudomonas, Rhodopseudomonas, Synergistes and Syntrophomonas 
f the obtained sequences, 0.01–9.80% were related to two genera (Pseudomonas and Parvibaculum) with the metabolic capacity to perform x-oxidation reactions 
nly Pseudomonas has the ability to perform both b- and x-oxidation, in addition to desulfonation 
enn diagram of the presence and absence of genera (B).  In the four samples, 14 identiﬁed genera were related to anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds: Acinetobacter, Comamonas, Desulfobulbus, Desulfomonile, Geobacter, Geothrix, Holophaga, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhodopseudomonas, Sporomusa, Stenotrophomonas, Sulfuritalea and Syntrophorhabdus 
robably, the presence of Sulfuritalea genus was favored to sulfur and aromatic compounds 
oreover, this genus cans growth in heterotrophic conditions using organic acids and aromatic compounds such as benzoate (Kojima and Fukui, 2011) 
ome of these reasons are the composition of the support material, for example in FBR (de Oliveira et al., 2009), presence of toxic compounds (sulfophenyl carboxylic acids – SPC) during the process of LAS biodegradation (Lara-Martin et al., 2010) and presence of toxic compounds in the laundry wastewater (Braga and Varesche, 2014) 
his conclusion is supported by physical–chemical results (Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2) and the several sulfur cycle genera found which will be discussed below. 3.3.2 
he relative abundance of these genera increased between Stage II (SB-4.8% and PS-6.2%) and Stage III (SB-20.3 and PS-55.3%) 
f these, certain genera (Desulfatirhabdium, Desulfomicrobium, Desulfomonile and Desulfovibrio) are related to aromatic compound degradation and have already been identiﬁed in previous studies (Cook et al., 1998; Brenner et al., 2005; Duarte et al., 2010; Delforno et al., 2014) 
n addition, it was observed speciﬁc microbiota related to sulﬁde and elementary sulfur (Brenner et al., 2005)

his result is indicative of the inhibition of LAS-removing microbiota at S2 concentrations greater than 20 mg S L1 
y using DGGE, microbial stratiﬁcation was observed in the reactor in association with granule size, even though the reactor is considered to be a completely mixed regime 
ntroduction Surfactants are one of the most versatile products 
n UASB reactor, Okada et al. (2014), noted that it is feasible the LAS removal in commercial laundry wastewater without supplementary feeding, only supplementation with buffering agent (sodium bicarbonate) 
he increase of SLLR was to evaluate the changes in microbial community under higher LAS concentration associate with laundry wastewater without supplementary feeding 
tage I consisted of the reactivation of microorganisms because the granular sludge was kept under refrigeration (4 °C) 
n most cases, when the inﬂuent concentration exceeds these concentrations the reactor becomes unstable 
owever, due to the satisfactory results obtained in Stage II, the concentration of LAS inﬂuent was doubled to evaluate the microbial response under higher LAS concentration 
t is noteworthy that the LAS concentration in the Stage III is below of inhibition concentration (50–100 mg LAS L1) as determined by Angelidaki et al. (2004), Garcia et al. (2005). 2.3 
fter each collection, the commercial laundry wastewater was characterized 
hus, the dilution during the Stage II was around 1:9 (laundry wastewater: public water supply) while at Stage III was around 1:5 (laundry wastewater: public water supply). 2.5 
sing the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) RDP’s Pipeline (http://pyro.cme.msu.edu/index.jsp; Cole et al., 2009), the sequences were processed as described in Delforno et al. (2014) 
he RDP-Classiﬁer was used for the taxonomic classiﬁcation of sequences representative of each OTU 
ecause of the high concentration of LAS, the laundry wastewater was diluted with a public water supply to obtain an inﬂuent LAS concentration range of 12.0– 28.8 mg L1 (as a function of each stage), which is below the inhibitory level for anaerobic processes (50 mg LAS L1; Angelidaki et al., 2004) 
tage I (26 days) was characterized by microbial reactivation because the granular sludge was refrigerated 
n Stage II (only laundry wastewater by 65 days), the SOLR decreased to 21 ± 9 mg COD gVS1 d1 
he increase in sulﬁde concentrations was due to the increase in laundry wastewater input into the reactor 
lthough increasing concentrations of LAS can be connected to the reduction removal efﬁciency (Delforno et al., 2012), a high removal of LAS was observed during a period of Stage III (days 151–185) in which the sulﬁde levels were lower 
uring days 151–185, the LAS removal was 85% in association with a sulﬁde concentration of 1 ± 2 mg S L1 
t is noteworthy that the feeding of EGSB reactor without synthetic medium (only laundry wastewater) did not result in system instability 
hus, the absence of inﬂuent supplementation (present study) showed an increase around 15% comparing to Delforno et al. (2014) which supplemented with synthetic medium 
n UASB reactor Okada et al. (2013) for an SOLR of 30 ± 1 mg COD gVS1 d1, the LAS removal efﬁciency was 76%, whereas for 70–180 mg COD gVS1 d1, the removal values ranged from 37% to 53% 
t Stage III, the SOLR was similar to Stage II (21 ± 11 mg COD gVS1 d1) but the COD removal was 48 ± 19% 
herefore, the sulﬁde levels in the reactor were related to the LAS removal rate (Fig. 2) 
lthough the anaerobic microbiota can support high S2 concentrations (100–150 mg L1, at a pH of 6.8; Speece, 1983), the results demonstrate that the microbiota involved with LAS removal do not thrive in concentrations greater than 20 mg L1 
ecause the reactor is considered completely mixed (i.e., a high ratio of recirculation ﬂow to feed ﬂow), the nutrient distribution does not differ along the reactor (Seghezzo et al., 1998) 
owever, stratiﬁcation was observed in relation to  41  the size of the granules 
n the phase separator (P5), no granules were found, only ﬂocculent biomass attached to the acrylic 
he P4 biomass was 78% similar to the phase separator sample (P5), both of which lack granular structure 
hese regions likely experienced the largest changes to the original biomass 
or this reason, the absence of the granular structures results in greater susceptibility of the microbiota to environmental changes 
his pattern was likely due to the presence of a dead zone with fragmented granules. 3.3 
icrobial composition Using the Ion Torrent PGM technology for massive sequencing, it was obtained 396,818 sequences of 16S rRNA genes (4 samples;  Fig. 3 
luster analysis based on the DGGE proﬁles for the domain Bacteria 
uring the processing of sequences, 216,998 sequences were removed due to the low quality of the bases (Phred > 20), lengths less than 200 bp, chimeras or ambiguous bases 
hus, 56.6% of the total sequences were discarded 
fter processing, the average size of the sequenced fragments was 313–329 bp 
y analyzing of coverage (using the Good formula), it was determined that 95–96% of all the microbial communities were accessed 
he inhibition of microbiota likely occurred due to the SLLR 
imilar results were obtained in the DGGE analysis, which showed large changes in the populations in the biomass of Stage III 
or the comparison of the four samples, the Bray–Curtis index was used (Fig. 4A) 
he biomass grouped according to the operation stages of the reactor 
ith increased operation time in the reactors, the similarity between the biomass of different regions increased 
y means of the presence/absence of genera in the Venn diagram, it was determined that 22% of the identiﬁed genera were present in all four samples 
n contrast, 5–11% of the genera were unique to each sample (Fig. 4B) 
y using the RDP-Classiﬁer, over 95% of the sequences were classiﬁed at the phylum level 
t the genera level, the percentage ranged from 16% to 75% of the classiﬁed sequences 
xcept for the sample from Stage II SB, in which the phylum Bacteroidetes was higher, the phylum Proteobacteria was the most abundant (Fig. 5A) 
icrobial composition regarding to LAS degradation In the total, 175 genera were obtained 
f these, 33 genera, representing 2.0–19.6% of the total sequences obtained from the samples, were related to the degradation of LAS and/or aromatic compounds 
igher percentages were obtained in Stage III (15.9– 19.6% for 2.7 ± 0.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1), which the SLLR was higher than in Stage II (2.0–6.1% for 1.0 ± 0.3 mg LAS gVS1 d1) 
owever, during the stage III the ﬂuctuations of sulﬁde levels resulted in a decrease of LAS removal 
ut, the speciﬁc LAS removal rate (SLRR) increased from 0.9 ± 0.3 mg gVS1 d1 (Stage II) to 1.6 ± 0.8 mg gVS1 d1 (Stage III) supporting the higher percentage of microorganism related to the degradation of LAS and/or aromatic compounds 
hus, Pseudomonas plays a necessary role in the microbial consortium that mineralizes LAS (Brenner et al., 2005).  T.P 
ith the exception of Sulfuritalea, the other genera have been identiﬁed in another studies related to LAS degradation (de Oliveira et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2010; Delforno et al., 2012; Duarte et al., 2010) 
his result shows the existence of a microbiological core in common among the four samples and, consequently, the role of these microorganisms in LAS degradation 
he microbial community inside the reactor can be affected due to several reasons 
n addition, metabolized byproducts from compounds present in the laundry wastewater can represent one more factor toxic to microbial community

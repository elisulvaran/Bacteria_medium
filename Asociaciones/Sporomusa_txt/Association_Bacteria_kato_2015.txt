roposal to unify Clostridium orbiscindens Winter et al. 1991 and Eubacterium plautii (Séguin 1928) Hofstad and Aasjord 1982, with description of Flavonifractor plautii gen. nov., comb. nov., and reassignment of Bacteroides capillosus to Pseudoflavonifractor capillosus gen. nov., comb. nov 
uminococcus albus (A) and Clostridium acetobutylicum (B) were used as the outgroup sequences 
lthough the closest relative of ArB09 (I. butyriciproducens) has not been reported to degrade aromatic compounds46, some strains in the Clostridium cluster IV were reported to fermentatively decompose diverse aromatic compounds 
or example, Flavonifractor plautii (formerly Clostridium orbiscindens) has the ability to degrade flavonoids via phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) as the intermediate47

he dominant phylotypes ArB-04 (96.8% identity to Pelotomaculum schinkii) and ArB-06 (98.4% identity to Cryptanaerobacter phenolicus) were clustered into the Desulfotomaculum subcluster Ih31 
icroorganisms in the Desulfotomaculum subcluster Ih were characterized by their ability to anaerobically metabolize various organic substrates in syntrophic association with hydrogenotrophic methanogens32 
urthermore, Desulfotomaculum subcluster Ih includes some strains that syntrophically degrade a range of aromatic compounds33,34 and was frequently detected as the dominant Scientific Reports | 5:14295 | DOI: 10.1038/srep14295  6  www.nature.com/scientificreports/  Figure 6

s the putative ring-cleavage microbes, bacteria within the phylum Firmicutes were dominantly detected from all of the enrichments, while the dominant phylotypes were not identical between enrichments on vanillate/protocatechuate/ catechol (family Peptococcaceae bacteria) and on syringate/gallate (family Ruminococcaceae bacteria) 
nstead, the phylotypes classified into phylum Firmicutes dominated in the enrichments supplemented with the lignin-derived aromatics and their degradation intermediates (Fig. 4B) 
mong the Firmicutes phylotypes, the phylotype ArB-01 (99.6% identity to Sporomusa sphaeroides) and ArB-02 (89.8% identity to Sporomusa paucivorans) were abundantly detected from vanillate- and syringate-enrichments, but not from enrichments with their degradation intermediates 
naerobic degradation of gallate were reported for some fermenting bacteria, including E. oxidoreducens, which is classified into Firmicutes and distantly related to the Ruminococcaceae phylotypes detected in this study22,23 
he resultant demethoxylated aromatics were decomposed into acetate and H2/CO2 by Firmicutes bacteria, while the bacterial groups responsible for PCA (family Peptococcaceae) and gallate (family Ruminococcaceae) were not identical 
he phylotype ArA-01 (98.9% identity to Methanosarcina vacuolata), which dominated in all enrichment cultures, was the only phylotype classified as an aceticlastic methanogen 
 phylogenetic tree based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of the phylotypes retrieved in this study and representative isolates in family Peptococcaceae (A) and Ruminococcaceae (B) 
n the enrichments on vanillate and its degradation intermediates (PCA and catechol), the phylotypes classified into family Peptococcaceae were dominant, while the dominant phylotypes varied among the supplemented aromatic compounds (Fig. 4B and Table S2) 
he phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences of representative Peptococcaceae isolates and the Peptococcaceae phylotypes detected in this study is shown in Fig. 5A 
aken together, it is very likely that the Peptococcaceae phylotypes mainly contributed to the ring-cleavage of the vanillate and/or its degradation intermediates via syntrophic interaction with hydrogenotrophic methanogens 
lthough the details in the pathway of aromatic ring cleavage have not been characterized, isolation of aromatics-degrading Peptococcaceae and Ruminococcaceae strains identified in this study followed by genomic and enzymatic studies will shed light on novel aspects of methanogenic degradation of lignin-derived aromatics in anaerobic environments.

 enes encoding the BtuBFCD type CN-Cbl/ cobamide transport system were found in most more than 90 % of the corrinoid-auxotrophic Bacteria 11 , indicating external CN-Cbl/cobamide uptake rather than de novo biosynthesis is a common strategy of microorganisms to acquire this essential cofactor

 N-Cbl was depleted at higher rates in the 25 mg l21 CN-Cbl-amended Dehalococcoides cultures

 he cobamide concentrations in these dechlorinating cocultures ranged from 10 to 30 ng l21 suggesting that the cobamide flux may be the relevant factor to sustain Dehalococcoides ’ dechlorination activity in microbial communities

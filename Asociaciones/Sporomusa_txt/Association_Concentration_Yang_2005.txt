rganic acid concentrations were determined with a DX-320 ion chromatography (IC) system, using 100 mL liquid samples 
 els were stained for 30 min with a 1:10,000 dilution of GelStars nucleic acid stain (Bio Whittaker, Denmark) and analyzed using the Gel Doc 2000 system (BioRad) and QuantityOne software (BioRad). 2.7 
 t the start of the experiment, 60 mL of the chemostat culture was added to each bottle anaerobically by gas purging with an 80% N2/20% CO2 mixture during the transfer 
  basal medium (Yang and McCarty, 1998) supplemented with 1.7 mM sodium benzoate, 20 mg/L yeast extract, and 0.98 mM PCE was added to the chemostat using a syringe pump at a rate of 50 mL/day, resulting in a 38day retention time 
 hlorinated ethenes, ethene, methane, and acetate were measured every 5–7 days to monitor the physiological changes of the cultures 
 nalytical methods PCE, TCE, cDCE, VC, ethene, and methane were quantiﬁed by a Fisons HRGC Mega 2 Series gas chromatography (GC) (Fisons, Milan, Italy), using 250 mL headspace samples 
 ang et al. / Water Research 39 (2005) 3954–3966  KOH eluent gradient was used: 0–7 min, 1 mM KOH; 7–25 min, 1–25 mM KOH; 25–28 min, 25–60 mM KOH; 28–28.1 min, 60–1 mM KOH; and 28.1–32 min, 1 mM KOH 
 NA extraction From each subculture 10 mL of sample was transferred with sterile syringe into 15 mL polypropylene tubes and immediately centrifuged at 4500g for 10 min 
 fter discarding the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL DNA extraction buffer (50 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate; pH 8) and DNA was extracted and puriﬁed according to the method of Sigler and Zeyer (Sigler and Zeyer, 2002) 
 he PCR cocktail contained 0.2 mM of each primer, 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleotide (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland), 2 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mg mL1 bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland), 1 U of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), 1 mL of DNA extract, and 1  PCR reaction buffer in a ﬁnal volume of 50 mL 
 fter initial denaturation at 95 1C for 5 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 1C for 30 s, primer annealing at 55 1C for 45 s and extension at 72 1C for 45 s was performed followed by a ﬁnal extension step at 72 1C for 5 min 
 lectrophoresis was performed in 1  TAE buffer (0.04 M Tris base, 0.02 M sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA; pH 7.4) at 60 1C and 75 V for 15 h 
 fter incubation for 3 h at 421C, 2 mL of the solution containing the eluted DNA was used for PCR and DGGE analysis described above 
 he optimal hybridization stringency of Dsf440 and Dsf475 was determined with the acetate/PCE subculture by increasing the formamide concentration in the hybridization buffer in increments of 5% at a constant hybridization temperature of 42 1C 
 ang et al. / Water Research 39 (2005) 3954–3966  3958  Approximately 10 mL of each subculture sample was immediately ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphatebuffered saline (PBS; 0.13 M NaCl, 7 mM Na2HPO4, and 3 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) at 0 1C for 12 h, washed twice in PBS and subsequently stored in 50% ethanol in PBS at 20 1C until further analysis (Zarda et al., 1998) 
 ixed samples were applied to eight-well, teﬂon-coated slides (Erie Scientiﬁc Co., Portsmouth, NH), air-dried, and dehydrated in an ethanol series (50%, 80% and 96%) for 3 min each 
  mixture of 1 mL probe (25–30 ng/mL), 9 mL hybridization buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 20 mM TrisHCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.01% SDS (pH 7.2)), and a speciﬁc amount of formamide depending on the probe used (Table 1) was applied to each well, followed by incubation for 2 h in a humid chamber at 42 1C 
 he slides were washed in pre-warmed washing buffer for 15 min at 48 1C, then rinsed with deionized water, and air-dried 
 he washing buffer contained 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.2), 10 mM EDTA, 0.01% SDS, and 636 or 112 mM NaCl (when 5% or 30% formamide was used during hybridization, respectively) 
 fter incubation for 3 min at room temperature in the dark, the slides were rinsed with deionized water and air-dried 
 ffect of PCR template concentration on the composition and distribution of total community 16S rDNA clone libraries 
 n contrast, the second approach may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the microbial community structure including identiﬁcation of unknown organisms from environmental samples 
 very day 50 mL of liquid was removed to bring the liquid volume back to 1.9 L 
 fter about four weeks of incubation when 80% of the chlorinated ethenes was degraded (in terms of total chlorine removal) in the subcultures, these cultures were transferred (50% v/v) into the fresh basal medium 
 orption of chlorinated compounds by the rubber stoppers was less than 5% after the ﬁrst few days so that good mass balances could be maintained throughout the studies 
 hen probing for Desulfitobacterium species, which belong to the grampositive bacteria, a pretreatment procedure with lysozyme (400 units/mL for 5 min at 0 1C) was included before hybridization to increase the permeability of these cells (Meier et al., 1999) 
 fter hybridization, 20 mL of DNA intercalating ﬂuorescent dye 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) (1 ng/mL) was added to each well

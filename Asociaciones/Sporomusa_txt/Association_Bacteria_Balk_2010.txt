pores located terminally, and cells stained Gram-negative. 16S rRNA analysis and G+C content A phylogenetic analysis of the almost full-length 16S rRNA sequence (1,386 bases) revealed that strain An4 is a member of the genus Sporomusa within the family Acidaminococcaceae of the order Clostridiales of class “Clostridia” of the phylum Firmicutes of the domain Bacteria (Garrity and Holt 2000) (Fig. 2)

rowth of these two strains in the medium with (per) chlorate did not result in a change of product formation with lactate as a substrate, which was the case for strain An4 (Fig. 3, Table 2) 
ransferring and adapting the strains several times to the medium containing perchlorate and lactate or methanol did not result in a substantial reduction of perchlorate to chloride 
lthough perchlorate and chlorate were reduced by the strain An4, lactate was not consumed completely 
robably, (per)chlorate utilization inhibited further fermentative growth with the remaining lactate

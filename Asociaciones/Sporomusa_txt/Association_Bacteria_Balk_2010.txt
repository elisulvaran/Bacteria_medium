pores located terminally and cells stained Gram-negative . 16S rRNA analysis and G+C content A phylogenetic analysis of the almost full-length 16S rRNA sequence 1,386 bases revealed that strain An4 is a member of the genus Sporomusa within the family Acidaminococcaceae of the order Clostridiales of class “ Clostridia ” of the phylum Firmicutes of the domain Bacteria Garrity and Holt 2000 ( Fig . 2 
he closest relative of strain An4 is Sporomusa strain DR5 and S. ovata based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis 99 % and 98 % sequence similarity respectively 
esting per chlorate reduction by other members of the genus Sporomusa The ability of Sporomusa species S. ovata =DSM 2662 and S. aerivorans =DSM 13326 to reduce perchlorate was tested either with lactate or with methanol

lthough the major fatty acids iso-βOH-C13:0 and C16:1 Δ7 were present in all the strains the composition of the remaining fatty acids was quite different . Discussion A Sporomusa strain An4 that is capable of reducing per chlorate to chloride was obtained from an underground gas storage in Russia 
he genus Sporomusa was created in 1984 Möller et al . 1984 to accommodate a number of strains of anaerobic acetogenic bacteria distinguished by having a Gram-negative cell wall and an ability to form endospores two properties whose coincidence is uncommon in Microbiology 
n general the members of the genus Sporomusa can utilize a wide variety of electron donors 
ll Sporomusa species have been described to gain energy for growth by the reduction of carbon dioxide to acetate

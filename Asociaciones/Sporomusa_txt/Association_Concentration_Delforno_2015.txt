itrate and sulfate were quantiﬁed by ion chromatography using a Dionex ICS-5000 with IonPAC AS23 4 mm and an eluent of Na2CO3/NaHCO3 1 mL min1 
 he project accession number is PRJEB8003 . In the total ﬁve samples were taken to analyze the composition of the laundry wastewater two samples during the Stage II and three samples during the Stage III the average values found were 119 ± 53 mg LAS L1 , 1582 ± 455 mg COD L1 and 205 ± 104 mg S L1 sulfate 
 he laundry wastewater analyzed by Braga and Varesche 2014 possessed similar levels of LAS 162 ± 244 mg LAS L1 and COD 1710 ± 968 mg COD L1 but a lower sulfate concentration 7.0 ± 6.4 mg S L1 and a lower pH 5.6 ± 0.9 
 elforno et al. 2014 who analyzed seven samples of laundry wastewater from a commercial laundry located in São Carlos SP Brazil obtained similar values of 181 ± 82 mg LAS L1 1603 ± 692 mg COD L1 and 124 ± 74 mg S L1 of sulfate 
 ccordingly the sulfate concentration increased Table 1 , resulting in a higher concentration of sulﬁde generated by the sulfate reduction 
 possible relationship was observed between increases in the concentration of S2 in the efﬂuent due to sulfate in the laundry wastewater and decreases in surfactant removal 
 n the other hand there are compounds in laundry wastewater which favor the degradation of the LAS such as sequestrants e.g. EDTA due to decrease the amount of LAS adsorbed in the biomass Delforno et al. 2014 Okada et al. 2014 . Additionally the reactor was subjected to high inﬂuent sulfate concentrations 30–54 mg S L1 
 icrobial composition regarding to sulfur cycle Due to the high concentration of sulfate in the wastewater 205 ± 104 mg S L1 , genera associated with the sulfur cycle were highly abundant 4.8 % –55.3 % Supplementary Fig . 2 
 he relative abundance in Stage II ranged from 0.01 % to 0.30 % in association with an inﬂuent sulfate concentration of 29.2 ± 10.1 mg S L1 whereas the relative abundance in the Stage III ranged from 3.54 % to 4.75 % in association with an inﬂuent sulfate concentration of 53.8 ± 17.2 mg S L1 
 n Stages II and III the synthetic medium was replaced with diluted laundry wastewater only the sodium bicarbonate was kept to maintain a neutral pH at two speciﬁc LAS loading rates SLLRs : 1.0 ± 0.3 mg LAS gTVS1 d1 Stage II – 12.0 ± 3.0 mg LAS L1 inﬂuent and 2.7 ± 0.7 mg LAS gTVS1 d1 Stage III – 28.8 ± 6.4 mg LAS L1 inﬂuent 
 ynthetic medium The reactor was fed with a modiﬁed mineral medium an adjusted MgCl2 concentration of 25 mg L1 Angelidaki et al. 1990 vitamins Touzel and Albagnac 1983 , sodium bicarbonate 400 mg L1 and a mixture of co-substrates , which consisted of ethanol 250 mg COD L1 , methanol 250 mg COD L1 and yeast extract 250 mg COD L1 . 2.4 
 he primary acids detected were lactic acid 168.6 ± 174.8 mg L1 and malic acid 153.6 ± 326.7 mg L1

 relationship between the S2 concentration in the efﬂuent and the surfactant removal efﬁciency was observed 
 ecause of its intense use LAS can be found in domestic sewage 1–18 mg L1 and laundry wastewater 17–1024 mg L1 Braga and Varesche 2014 Delforno et al. 2014 
 he authors aforementioned observed that the concentration of volatile fatty acids and others compounds present in the laundry wastewater can support the microbial activity 
 n addition studies have been applied LAS inﬂuent concentration range from 9.5 ± 3.0 to 23.9 ± 5.0 mg L1 in FBR Braga and Varesche 2011 and around 10.0 mg L1 in EGSB and UASB reactor Delforno et al. 2014 Okada et al. 2014 
 he higher removal rate was 82 % and the lower was 68 % for UASB and FBR respectively 
 herefore this study investigated the removal of LAS in commercial laundry wastewater with two speciﬁc LAS loading rates SLLRs 1.0 and 2.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1 in an EGSB reactor 12.0 and 29 mg LAS L1 in the inﬂuent , respectively without supplementary feeding 
 GSB – expanded granular sludge bed reactor The reactor consisted of an acrylic apparatus with a volume of 1.40 L a height of 1.0 m and a diameter of 0.04 m 
 he wastewater was collected after the ﬁrst rinse in 10 or 20 L high-density polyurethane bottles and the bottles were stored at a temperature of 4 °C 
 n addition due to the high concentration of LAS in the wastewater and the inhibitory concentration for methanogenic process the laundry wastewater was diluted in public water supply as a function of LAS concentration determined in each stage 
 hysical chemical analysis Analyses of pH 4500 total solids 2540D , total dissolved sulﬁde 4500-S2-.D and chemical oxygen demand COD 5220D were determined according to the Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater APHA-AWWA-WPCF , 2005 
 or this purpose homogeneous samples of the sludge blanket SB Stages II and III and the phase separator PS Stages II and III were sampled . ( ii The second method aimed to evaluate the community at different sampling points in the sludge blanket and the phase separator thus verifying the existence of a possible microbial stratiﬁcation along the reactor ( only Stage III 
 he DNA quality was assessed by a standard of 260/280 nm > 1.8 as measured by an ND-2000 spectrophotometer Nanodrop Inc. Wilmington DE and agarose gel electrophoresis . 2.6.2 
 he conﬁdence threshold adopted was 80 % for genus and 50 % for other taxonomic levels phylum-family 
 he pH ranged from 9.6 to 10.7 and the VFA average was 442 ± 556 mg COD L1 
 nterestingly Braga and Varesche 2014 obtained a peak LAS concentration of 1024 mg L1 whereas the present results only reached 202 mg LAS L1 
 oreover the pH was basic and ranged from 9.0 to 10.0 
 he speciﬁc organic loading rate SOLR was 69 ± 9 mg COD gVS1 d1 inﬂuent COD concentration of 755 ± 277 mg L1 , and the removal efﬁciency was 89 ± 19 % Table 1

 he speciﬁc LAS loading rate SLLR in Stage II was 1.0 ± 0.3 mg LAS gVS1 d1 12.3 ± 3.2 mg LAS L1 inﬂuent , and the average removal was 92.9 ± 10.3 % 
 elforno et al . 2014 operating an EGSB reactor with a similar SLLR 1.0 ± 0.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1 of laundry wastewater and SOLR 71 ± 13 mg COD gVS1 d1 of synthetic medium , obtained an average of 76.4 ± 18.1 % 
 robably the SOLR was the key parameter for obtaining high surfactant removal rates with values of 21 ± 11 and 71 ± 13 mg COD gVS1 d1 for the present study Stage II and Delforno et al . 2012 , respectively 
 he difference between Stage II and Stage III was due to the COD related to sulﬁde Stage II 1.76 ± 2.33 mg S L1 Stage III 20.2 ± 25.1 mg S L1 
 he SLLR was 2.7 ± 0.7 mg LAS gSTV1 d1 LAS inﬂuent 28.8 ± 6.4 mg L1 , and the LAS removal rate decreased to 58.6 ± 25.8 %

 elforno et al . / Bioresource Technology 192 2015 37–45 the sulﬁde concentrations were 9 ± 6 and 62 ± 25 mg S L1 and the LAS removal rates were 50 % and 30 % respectively for LAS inﬂuent concentrations of 32 ± 7 and 30 ± 2 mg LAS L1 respectively 
 ccording to the mass balance of the total amount of LAS added to the reactor 4460 mg LAS 7 % and 2 % were adsorbed to the biomass in the sludge blanket and phase separator , respectively 
 iological degradation accounted for 52 % whereas adsorption and biological removal removed 61 % 
 73 % similarity existed between the populations of P2 and P3 both of which contained well-deﬁned granules 
 owever a similarity coefﬁcient of only 30 % existed between these two groups i.e. biomass structure in the form of granules P2 and P3 and ﬂocculent material P5 and P4 
 he biomass of the phase separator region P5 and P4 exhibited lower similarity coefﬁcients < 34 % when compared to the biomass from the inoculum 
 he highest similarity coefﬁcient 60 % was between the inoculum and Stage II biomass sludge blanket 
 he biomass of the ﬂow distribution P1 was 52 % similar to the points P2 and P3 granular biomass and < 40 % similar to the points P4 and P5 ﬂocculent biomass

 urthermore the analyses of the rarefaction curves were used to infer that the phylum taxonomic level 80 % similarity and the number of sequences obtained were sufﬁcient to represent all the diversity in the biomass Supplementary Fig . 1 
 owever the rarefaction curves demonstrated that even with a large number of sequences it was not possible to access the entire diversity at the genus 95 % and species 97 % level 
 he highest values of Chao1 and rarefaction were obtained in Stage II with an SLLR of 1.0 ± 0.3 mg LAS gSTV1 d1 whereas the lowest values were obtained in Stage III with an SLLR of 2.7 ± 0.7 mg LAS gSTV1 d1 
 his pattern was observed for the biomass in Stage II PS SB and Stage III PS SB which exhibited similarity values of 25 % and 45 % , respectively 
 urthermore a similarity value of only 10 % was observed between the biomass of Stage II and Stage III a result of the increased concentration of LAS and reactor operation time 
 mong the major phyla the Proteobacteria phylum represented greater than 20 % relative abundance of the samples from Stage III and 65– 70 % of the sludge blanket and phase separator samples 
 he 20 most abundant genera excluding unclassiﬁed ones represented 99 % Stage II – SB , 84 % Stage II – PS , 93 % Stage III – SB and 95 % Stage III – PS of the relative abundances date not shown 
 ncluding the unclassiﬁed sequences the values were 15 % Stage II – SB , 24 % Stage II – PS , 50 % Stage III – SB and 71 % Stage III – PS 
 mong the analyzed sequences 0.16–10.79 % of the sequences were related to the following genera that perform desulfonation reactions Acinetobacter Aeromonas Comamonas Desulfovibrio Hydrogenophaga and Pseudomonas 
 f the obtained sequences 0.36–12.30 % were related to the following genera with the metabolic capacity to perform b-oxidation Azoarcus Geobacter Parvibaculum Pseudomonas Rhodopseudomonas Synergistes and Syntrophomonas 
 f the obtained sequences 0.01–9.80 % were related to two genera Pseudomonas and Parvibaculum with the metabolic capacity to perform x-oxidation reactions 
 he relative abundance of these genera increased between Stage II SB-4.8 % and PS-6.2 % and Stage III SB-20.3 and PS-55.3 % 
 he conﬁdence threshold adopted in the RDP Classiﬁer was 50 % for phylum/family and 80 % for genus . of these genera are related to the LAS degradation and/or its intermediaries however they do perform important functions associated with reactor stability 
 his result is indicative of the inhibition of LAS-removing microbiota at S2 concentrations greater than 20 mg S L1 
 he increase of SLLR was to evaluate the changes in microbial community under higher LAS concentration associate with laundry wastewater without supplementary feeding 
 n most cases when the inﬂuent concentration exceeds these concentrations the reactor becomes unstable 
 owever due to the satisfactory results obtained in Stage II the concentration of LAS inﬂuent was doubled to evaluate the microbial response under higher LAS concentration 
 t is noteworthy that the LAS concentration in the Stage III is below of inhibition concentration 50–100 mg LAS L1 as determined by Angelidaki et al . 2004 , Garcia et al . 2005 . 2.3 
 ecause of the high concentration of LAS the laundry wastewater was diluted with a public water supply to obtain an inﬂuent LAS concentration range of 12.0– 28.8 mg L1 as a function of each stage which is below the inhibitory level for anaerobic processes 50 mg LAS L1 Angelidaki et al. , 2004 
 tage I 26 days was characterized by microbial reactivation because the granular sludge was refrigerated 
 n Stage II only laundry wastewater by 65 days , the SOLR decreased to 21 ± 9 mg COD gVS1 d1 
 lthough increasing concentrations of LAS can be connected to the reduction removal efﬁciency Delforno et al. 2012 , a high removal of LAS was observed during a period of Stage III days 151–185 in which the sulﬁde levels were lower 
 uring days 151–185 the LAS removal was 85 % in association with a sulﬁde concentration of 1 ± 2 mg S L1 
 hus the absence of inﬂuent supplementation present study showed an increase around 15 % comparing to Delforno et al . 2014 which supplemented with synthetic medium 
 n UASB reactor Okada et al . 2013 for an SOLR of 30 ± 1 mg COD gVS1 d1 the LAS removal efﬁciency was 76 % whereas for 70–180 mg COD gVS1 d1 the removal values ranged from 37 % to 53 % 
 t Stage III the SOLR was similar to Stage II 21 ± 11 mg COD gVS1 d1 but the COD removal was 48 ± 19 % 
 lthough the anaerobic microbiota can support high S2 concentrations 100–150 mg L1 at a pH of 6.8 Speece 1983 , the results demonstrate that the microbiota involved with LAS removal do not thrive in concentrations greater than 20 mg L1 
 he P4 biomass was 78 % similar to the phase separator sample P5 , both of which lack granular structure 
 hus 56.6 % of the total sequences were discarded 
 y analyzing of coverage using the Good formula , it was determined that 95–96 % of all the microbial communities were accessed 
 y means of the presence/absence of genera in the Venn diagram it was determined that 22 % of the identiﬁed genera were present in all four samples 
 n contrast 5–11 % of the genera were unique to each sample Fig . 4B 
 y using the RDP-Classiﬁer over 95 % of the sequences were classiﬁed at the phylum level 
 t the genera level the percentage ranged from 16 % to 75 % of the classiﬁed sequences 
 f these 33 genera representing 2.0–19.6 % of the total sequences obtained from the samples were related to the degradation of LAS and/or aromatic compounds 
 igher percentages were obtained in Stage III 15.9– 19.6 % for 2.7 ± 0.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1 , which the SLLR was higher than in Stage II 2.0–6.1 % for 1.0 ± 0.3 mg LAS gVS1 d1 
 ut the speciﬁc LAS removal rate SLRR increased from 0.9 ± 0.3 mg gVS1 d1 Stage II to 1.6 ± 0.8 mg gVS1 d1 Stage III supporting the higher percentage of microorganism related to the degradation of LAS and/or aromatic compounds

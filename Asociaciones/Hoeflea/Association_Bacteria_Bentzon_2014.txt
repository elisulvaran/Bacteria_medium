C-SIM-MS detection and quantification of free indole-3-acetic acid bacterial galls on the marine alga Prionitis lanceolata (Rhodophyta) J 
urrently, the Hoeflea genus represents seven species, all of which are isolated from marine and estuarine environments (1, 3–8) 
hese organisms may facilitate phytoplankton colonization by the production of secondary metabolites that inhibit the growth of potentially competing bacteria (antibiotics) and promote phytoplankton growth (auxins) (9, 10) 
hether the similarities between the Hoeflea organisms and the Roseobacter clade extends to the production of these bioactive compounds is currently unknown, as the Hoeflea genus is not yet well described, and only two whole-genome sequences are available (accession numbers ABIA00000000 and ARCZ00000000) 
enomic DNA was extracted from a culture growing to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of ⬇1 in ZoBell medium (12) using the E.Z.N.A. tissue DNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA), and a paired-end sequencing library with inserts of 450 bp was prepared 
ndexing was done using short indexing primers (13), and sequencing was done on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer at the University of Copenhagen sequencing center 
he sequencing data represent 6.1 ⫻ 107 sequencing reads that were assembled using Velvet de novo assembler version 1.2.08,  November/December 2014 Volume 2 Issue 6 e01213-14  with scaffolding switched off and a k-mer of 47; this produced 282 contigs with a mean length of 19.5 kb, the longest being 239 kb 
he genome was annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline and the online Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) resource version 2.0 (14) 
econdary metabolite prediction was done using antiSMASH 2.0 (15) and NaPDoS 
AL378 harbors two bacteriocin gene clusters and two terpene-encoding gene clusters 
he RAST annotation suggested that bacteriocins produced by the strain are similar to colicin V and the broad-spectrum antibacterial protein marinocine from the marine bacterium Marinomonas mediterranea (16)

t was established in 2005 (1) as a consequence of the reclassification of the species Agrobacterium ferrugineum (a marine, star-shaped, aggregate-forming bacterium) into the novel Pseudorhodobacter genus (2) 
ased on 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the Pseudorhodobacter genus did not, however, include the strain A. ferrugineum LMG 128, which subsequently became the type species of the Hoeflea genus, Hoeflea marina LMG 128 (1) 
ne trait commonly shared between the members of Hoeflea is the association with primary producers 
n addition to rosette formation, phytoplankton colonization is a trait the Hoeflea organisms share with some members of the prevalent marine Roseobacter clade

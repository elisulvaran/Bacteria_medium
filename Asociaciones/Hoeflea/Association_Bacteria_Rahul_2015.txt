International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (2015), 65, 2403– 2409  DOI 10.1099/ijs.0.000277  Hoeflea olei sp. nov., a diesel-oil-degrading, anoxygenic, phototrophic bacterium isolated from backwaters and emended description of the genus Hoeflea K 
ased on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain JC234T belonged to the genus Hoeflea within the family Phyllobacteriaceae, and was closely related to Hoeflea alexandrii AM1V30T (98.1 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Hoeflea halophila JG120-1T (97.6 %) and other members of the genus Hoeflea (,96.4 %) 
train JC234T showed 22¡2 % and 28¡1.5 % DNA–DNA hybridization with Hoeflea alexandrii KCTC 22096T and Hoeflea halophila KCTC 23107T, respectively 
n the basis of morphological, physiological, genetic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomical analyses, we conclude that strain JC234T represents a novel species of the genus Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea olei sp. nov. is proposed 
n emended description of the genus Hoeflea is also provided.  Reclassification of Agrobacterium ferrugineum LMG 128 (Ahrens, 1968; Rüger & Höfle, 1992) resulted in the creation of the genus Hoeflea (Peix et al., 2005) with Hoeflea marina as the type species 
t the time of writing, the genus Hoeflea comprises six species with validly published names (http://www.bacterio.net/hoeflea.html): Hoeflea marina (Peix et al., 2005), Hoeflea phototrophica Abbreviations: Bchl-a, bacteriochlorophyll-a; DCM, dichloromethane; DDH, DNA–DNA hybridization; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PME, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine; SQDG, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the 16S rRNA and puf gene sequences of strain JC234T are HG965759 and LN811447, respectively

embers of the genus Hoeflea are Gram-stain-negative, aerobic or microaerobic, non-endospore-forming and halotolerant 
iphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PME), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), sulfoquinovo- syldiacylglycerol (SQDG), a few unidentified glycolipids, unidentified aminolipids and unidentified lipids are the major polar lipids of the genus Hoeflea

n nutrient agar, colonies of JC234T were round, flat to raised, initially colourless or light reddish-brown but later  Hoeflea halophila JG120-1T (GU564401) Hoeflea olei JC234T (HG965759)  60 67  53  The DNA–DNA reassociation value between strain JC234T and Hoeflea alexandrii KCTC 22096T was 22¡2 %, and between strain JC234T and Hoeflea halophila KCTC 23107T was 28¡1.5 %; these hybridization values are well within the recommended standards to delineate a bacterial species based on DDH (Stackebrandt & Goebel, 1994).  Hoeflea alexandrii AM1V30T (AJ786600)  81 0.01  The EzTaxon-e server search analysis revealed that strain JC234T was most closely related to members of genus Hoeflea, and the highest sequence similarity was observed with Hoeflea alexandrii AM1V30T (98.1 %), Hoeflea halophila JG120-1T (97.6 %) and other members of the genus Hoeflea (,96.4 %) 
he results of phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences suggested that strain JC234T clustered with the members of the genus Hoeflea and formed a separate clade along with the type strains of Hoeflea alexandrii and Hoeflea halophila (Fig. 1).

hototrophic growth, Bchl-a and puf genes were identified in strain JC234T but not in Hoeflea alexandrii KCTC 22096T or Hoeflea halophila KCTC 23107T 
mong other members of the genus Hoeflea, phototrophic growth was not reported but the presence of puf genes was reported in Hoeflea phototrophica DFL-43T (Biebl et al., 2006) 
lthough strain JC234T and Hoeflea phototrophica share the presence of Bchl-a and carotenoids, they differ importantly in phototrophic growth (anaerobic light) 
4).  Absorbance  Strain JC234T grew at pH 7–9 with optimum growth at pH 7, and differs from Hoeflea alexandrii KCTC 22096T and Hoeflea halophila KCTC 23107T which have a pH range of 6–9 
aCl was not required for growth of strain JC234T but could be tolerated up to 8 % (w/v), while the type strains of Hoeflea alexandrii and Hoeflea halophila are more and less tolerant, respectively (Table 1) 
train JC234T shared the presence of major fatty acids with Hoeflea alexandrii KCTC 22096T and Hoeflea halophila KCTC 23107T 
owever, significant differences in the relative amounts of C16 : 1v7c/C16 : 1v6c and C18 : 1v7c 11methyl were found between strain JC234T and the type strains of Hoeflea alexandrii and Hoelfea halophila (Table S1) 
dentification of SQDG in strain JC234T was based on the motility of the spot as demonstrated by Chung et al. (2013) in Hoeflea suaedae YC6898T, Hoeflea marina KACC 12993T and Hoeflea alexandrii KACC 12994T 
he polar lipid profile of strain JC234T was well in consonance with the type species of the genus Hoeflea (Hoeflea marina) which contained PC, PME, PG and PE as major lipids as reported by Chung et al. (2013) and data from this study (data not shown) 
he major quinone of strain JC234T was ubiquinone Q10, which is in line with members of the genus Hoeflea 
istinct phylogenetic, genotypic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic properties thus justify the description of strain JC234T as representative of a novel species of the genus Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea olei sp. nov. is proposed

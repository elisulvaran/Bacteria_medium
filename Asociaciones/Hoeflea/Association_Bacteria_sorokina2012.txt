ccording to phylogenetic analysis based on the comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences, the strain was closest to the organotrophic marine bacterium Hoeflea phototrophica (98.5% simi larity) 
he level of DNA–DNA homology with the type species of the genus Hoeflea was 19% 
ccording to its phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties, as well as to the results of phylogenetic analysis, strain Hf1 was classified into the genus Hoeflea of the family Phyllo bacteriaceae, order Rhizobiales of the phylum Alphaproteobacteria as a novel species, Hoeflea siderophila sp. nov

The results of comparative analysis of the pheno and genotypic characteristics of strain Hf1, and those of the closely related species [30–32], are listed in Table 3 
ccording to the results of phylogenetic analysis based on the com parison of the 16S rRNA gene sequences, strain Hf1 belonged to the cluster of the genus Hoeflea (Fig. 2), but formed a separate branch within this genus 
ISCUSSION The isolated strain of neutrophilic facultative anaerobic ironoxidizing bacteria shared common properties with members of the genus Hoeflea 
mong the main physiological properties of this strain are its ability to utilize Fe(II) compounds as electron donors during lithotrophic growth, and its  64  SOROKINA et al. 0.02  Aminobacer aminovorans DSM 7048T (AJ011759)  100  Aminobacer lissarensis CC495T (AF107722)  83  Mesorhizobium mediterraneum UPMCa36T (L38825)  59  Mesorhizobium loti LMG 6125T (X67229) Pseudaminobacter defluvii THI 051T (D32248)  97  Pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans BN12T (AF072542) Phyllobacterium catacumbae CSC19T (AY636000)  100  60  Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum IAM 13584T (D12789) Aquamicrobium defluvium DSM 11603T (Y15403)  100  Defluvibacter lusaliae DSM11099T (AJ132378) Hoeflea alexandrii AM1V30T (AJ786600) 100 100  Hoeflea siderophila sp. nov

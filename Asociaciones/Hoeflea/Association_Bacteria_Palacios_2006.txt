International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (2006), 56, 1991–1995  DOI 10.1099/ijs.0.64238-0  Hoeflea alexandrii sp. nov., isolated from the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum AL1V Lucı́a Palacios,1 David R 
n the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain AM1V30T was most closely related (97?4 % similarity) to the type strain of Hoeflea marina, which belongs to the family Phyllobacteriaceae within the order Rhizobiales of the class Alphaproteobacteria 
uring the course of this study, a second species was described by others as belonging to the genus Hoeflea, namely Hoeflea phototrophica; it showed a somewhat higher level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with respect to strain AM1V30T (98?2 %) and was also taken into account 
he fatty acid profiles, physiological and biochemical data and DNA G+C content (59?7 mol%) support the classification of strain AM1V30T as a member of the genus Hoeflea 
hus, AM1V30T represents a novel species within the genus Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea alexandrii sp. nov. is proposed 
wo other genera, Parvibaculum (Schleheck et al., 2004) and Hoeflea (Peix et al., 2005), have since been proposed for consideration as members of this family, on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data 
he genus Hoeflea was created to accommodate a single species, Hoeflea marina, based on a strain of marine origin (from the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Germany) previously assigned to the species Agrobacterium ferrugineum (Peix et al., 2005) 
ore recently, a second species within this genus was proposed, Hoeflea phototrophica (Biebl The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain AM1V30T is AJ786600 
his study deals with the characterization of a novel isolate, strain AM1V30T, and the proposal of a novel species of the genus Hoeflea 
oreover, the sequence of strain AM1V30T consistently aligned with those of the two Hoeflea species, regardless of the treeing method, which means that it can be considered as a member of the same genus 
he profile obtained largely resembled those of the two Hoeflea species,  Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 56 IP: 189.155.188.202 On: Thu, 15 Feb 2018 22:44:50  Hoeflea alexandrii sp. nov.  Fig. 1 
s has been indicated above, strain AM1V30T belongs to the genus Hoeflea on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data 
ifferentiating characteristics for the novel strain and species of the genus Hoeflea Strains: 1, AM1V30T (data from this study); 2, H. marina LMG 128T (Peix et al., 2005); 3, H. phototrophica DFL-43T (Biebl et al., 2006) 
he low values obtained support the definitive conclusion that strain AM1V30T represents a novel species within the genus Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea alexandrii sp. nov. is proposed.  Description of Hoeflea alexandrii sp. nov

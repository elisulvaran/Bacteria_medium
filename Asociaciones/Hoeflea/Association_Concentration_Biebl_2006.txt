fter 4 days growth in peptone medium to which 0?05–1 g l21 potassium tellurite had been added, cultures turned jet-black and refractile inclusions were visible in the cells 
 ellular fatty acid content (%) of strain DFL-43T in comparison with those of H. marina DSM 16791T and A. kielensis DSM 5980T Fatty acid values of less than 1 % are not shown 
 he 16S rRNA gene sequence data suggested that the strains belonged to the order Rhizobiales and were closest (98?5 % sequence similarity) to the recently described species Hoeflea marina 
 ood growth occurred in complex media with 0?5–7?0 % sea salts, at 25–33 6C (optimum, 31 6C) and at pH values in the range 6–9 
 n the basis of smaller cell size, different substrate utilization profile and photosynthetic pigment content, the novel strains can be classified as representatives of a second species of Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea phototrophica sp. nov. is proposed 
 n a recent survey, Schwalbach & Fuhrman (2005) quantified aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAPs) by means of epifluorescence microscopy and quantitative PCR and found them to constitute 1–2 % of all bacteria in the euphotic zone off the coast of Southern California 
 he phylogenetic position of strains DFL-43T and DFL-44 within the a2 subgroup of the Alphaproteobacteria is shown in a supplementary figure available in IJSEM Online.  63958 G 2006 IUMS  >10 % of total bacteria 
 he novel strains were able to grow at pH values between 5?8 and 9?5 
 etween pH 6?0 and 9?0, initial culture development was almost the same 
 ea salts were required at a concentration of at least 0?5 %; concentrations up to 7 % were tolerated.  Colonies of surface cultures were light-beige on full-strength marine broth 2216 (Difco) and wine-red on 10-fold-diluted marine broth

The utilization of carbon sources was checked in a mineral sea-water medium containing 0?1 g yeast extract l21 to provide the required growth factors 
 he following carbon sources were tested at a concentration of 1 g l21 (acids as sodium salts): acetate, butyrate, succinate, fumarate, malate, lactate, citrate, glutamate, pyruvate, glucose, fructose, ethanol, methanol, glycerol and yeast extract 
 he other substrates tested allowed only limited growth, with OD600 values ranging from 20 (glucose) to 60 % (fumarate, citrate) of that of the acetate culture; methanol and ethanol did not allow any growth at all

 iquid cultures containing (l21) 3 g peptone and 0?5 g yeast extract and varied amounts of sea salts revealed that pigment production was dependent on the salt concentration 
 ultures containing 3, 6 and 9 g sea salts l21 appeared  very pink, while cultures at the salt concentration of natural sea water were colourless 
 he cell mass from 30 ml culture grown at 6 g sea salts l21 was extracted with 3 ml acetone/ methanol (7 : 2) and the absorption spectrum of the extract was recorded (Fig. 2) 
 t showed the typical maxima of bacteriochlorophyll a at 367 and 775 nm and a high peak at 482 nm, indicating the presence of a carotenoid 
 he in vivo absorption spectrum obtained by suspension of cells in 75 % glycerol showed only weak absorption in the infrared region because of the low pigment content, but peaks at around 800 and 865 nm were recognizable (not shown)

 lthough the 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicate that the novel strains are very close to H. marina (98?5 % similarity) and more distant to A. kielensis (94?4 % similarity), there are marked phenotypic differences between the novel strains and both of these recognized species and these are also reflected in the wide range of DNA G+C contents 
 rowth occurs at concentrations of sea salts from 0?5–7?0 %, at temperatures of up to 33 uC (optimum, 31 uC) and at pH values in the range 6–9 
 hotosynthetic pigments were formed at low to medium salt concentrations, but not at the salt concentration of sea water (3?5 %) 
 olber et al. (2001) calculated, by extrapolation from measurements of bacteriochlorophyll a in tropical seas, that up to 10 % of the bacterioplankton were potentially capable of photosynthesis 
 ootstrap values with greater than 60 % confidence (percentage of 1000 resamplings) are shown at the branching points

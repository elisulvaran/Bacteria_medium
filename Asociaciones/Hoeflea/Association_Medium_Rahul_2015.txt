iphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PME), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), sulfoquinovo- syldiacylglycerol (SQDG), a few unidentified glycolipids, unidentified aminolipids and unidentified lipids are the major polar lipids of the genus Hoeflea 
oeflea phototrophica is the only species of this genus reported to have bacteriochlorophyll-a (Bchl-a) and puf genes; however it lacks anaerobic growth in the dark or light (Biebl et al., 2006) 
ahul and others  of the genus Hoeflea which can utilize diesel-oil for growth, contains Bchl-a and puf genes and can grow anaerobically in the light

arotenoid composition from phototrophically grown cells indicated the presence of hydroxydemethylspheroidene and three unidentified carotenoids (Fig 
hototrophic growth, Bchl-a and puf genes were identified in strain JC234T but not in Hoeflea alexandrii KCTC 22096T or Hoeflea halophila KCTC 23107T 
lthough strain JC234T and Hoeflea phototrophica share the presence of Bchl-a and carotenoids, they differ importantly in phototrophic growth (anaerobic light) 
chl-a and carotenoids of strain JC234T were observed only from phototrophically grown cells, while the culture grows equally well under both phototrophic and chemotrophic conditions (Fig 
4).  Absorbance  Strain JC234T grew at pH 7–9 with optimum growth at pH 7, and differs from Hoeflea alexandrii KCTC 22096T and Hoeflea halophila KCTC 23107T which have a pH range of 6–9 
aCl was not required for growth of strain JC234T but could be tolerated up to 8 % (w/v), while the type strains of Hoeflea alexandrii and Hoeflea halophila are more and less tolerant, respectively (Table 1) 
ther physiological and biochemical results are presented in the species description and Table 1 
he major fatty acids of strain JC234T were C18 : 1v7c/ C18 : 1v6c, C16 : 0 and C16 : 1v7c/C16 : 1v6c, with minor amounts of C18 : 1v7c 11-methyl and C18 : 0 
train JC234T shared the presence of major fatty acids with Hoeflea alexandrii KCTC 22096T and Hoeflea halophila KCTC 23107T 
owever, significant differences in the relative amounts of C16 : 1v7c/C16 : 1v6c and C18 : 1v7c 11methyl were found between strain JC234T and the type strains of Hoeflea alexandrii and Hoelfea halophila (Table S1) 
he polar lipid profile of strain JC234T contained PC, PME, PG, PE, SQDG and unidentified lipids L1, L2 and L3 (Fig 
dentification of SQDG in strain JC234T was based on the motility of the spot as demonstrated by Chung et al. (2013) in Hoeflea suaedae YC6898T, Hoeflea marina KACC 12993T and Hoeflea alexandrii KACC 12994T 
he spot corresponding to SQDG was eluted from the TLC plate, dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2 : 1, v/v) and the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of the chloroform/methanolic extract was recorded on a Bruker FTIR spectrometer in the wave number range of 3500– 500 cm21 
he infrared spectrum of the chloroform/methanolic extract showed characteristic absorption bands for sulfur-containing compounds at 959 cm21 and 792 cm21 indicating the presence of strong dehydration of SO3 and symmetrical C-O-S association with a C-O-SO3 group 
he above two characteristic bands and the other absorption bands indicating the -CH3 bending and C-H stretching confirmed the presence of SQDG (Fig 
he polar lipid profile of strain JC234T was well in consonance with the type species of the genus Hoeflea (Hoeflea marina) which contained PC, PME, PG and PE as major lipids as reported by Chung et al. (2013) and data from this study (data not shown) 
ased on the GC-MS analysis of diesel layer, various hydrocarbons were seen to decrease in abundance sequentially based on their carbon chain length and branching 
istinct phylogenetic, genotypic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic properties thus justify the description of strain JC234T as representative of a novel species of the genus Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea olei sp. nov. is proposed 
hototrophy is a recognized genus-specific character (Imhoff & Caumette, 2004) and hence it is debatable if a new genus needs to be described in future to accommodate this anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium based on multiple strains

ptimal growth was obtained in complex media with 15 g sea salts l”1, at 18–34 6C (30 6C optimum) and at pH 6.0–8.0 (optimum pH 6.5) 
 H2KT formed colonies that were small (1–2 mm), nonpigmented and opaque after 7–10 days on all agar media.  Fig. 1 
 he permissible (18–34 uC) and optimal (30 uC) growth temperatures were determined sequentially in an incubator, with shaking at 225 r.p.m. with periodic measurement of optical density at 600 nm (OD600) 
 ea salts were required at a concentration of at least 5 g l21, but WH2KT grew optimally at concentrations between 12.5 and 17.5 g l21 and tolerated only up to 25 g sea salts l21 
 ttachment was monitored microscopically on days 3, 7, 14, 30 and 49 
 he level of attachment (if observed) was recorded as the number of attachments per 106 Anabaena filaments (mean two heterocysts per filament) and the number of cells attached to each heterocyst 
 n contrast, cells of WH2KT were found attached to 28 % of observed heterocysts at day 7 and 55 % at day 49, with a mean of four cells per heterocyst 
 train WH2KT belongs to a cluster of named organisms that includes H. marina LMG 128T (96.9 % similarity), H. phototrophica DFL-43T (96.7 % similarity) and H. alexandrii AM1V30T (96.6 % similarity) 
 ultures require aerobic growth conditions and concentrations of sea salts above 5 g l21 but below 25 g l21 (optimum 15 g l21), temperatures of 18–34 uC (optimum 30 uC) and pH 6.0–8.0 (optimum pH 6.5) 
 nalysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence demonstrated that the symbiont was most closely related to the type strain of Hoeflea marina (96.9 % similarity), which belongs to the family Phyllobacteriaceae within the order Rhizobiales of the class Alphaproteobacteria

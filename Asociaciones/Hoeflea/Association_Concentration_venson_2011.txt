he predominant fatty acids were a summed feature that comprises C18 1v7c C18 1v9t C18 1v12t or any combination of these 64.0 % and an unidentified fatty acid of equivalent chain length 17.603 13.5 % 
 ptimal growth was obtained in complex media with 15 g sea salts l ” 1 at 18–34 6C 30 6C optimum and at pH 6.0–8.0 optimum pH 6.5 
 H2KT formed colonies that were small 1–2 mm , nonpigmented and opaque after 7–10 days on all agar media . Fig . 1 
 he permissible 18–34 uC and optimal 30 uC growth temperatures were determined sequentially in an incubator with shaking at 225 r.p.m . with periodic measurement of optical density at 600 nm OD600 
 ea salts were required at a concentration of at least 5 g l21 but WH2KT grew optimally at concentrations between 12.5 and 17.5 g l21 and tolerated only up to 25 g sea salts l21 
 atty acids detected in strain WH2KT included C18 1v7c/v9t/v12t or any combination of these 64.0 % , ECL 17.603 13.5 % , ECL 18.846/C19 1v6c 7.5 % , C18 1v9c 6.6 % , C18 0 4.0 % , 11-methyl C18 1v7c 2.6 % and C16 0 1.8 % 
 ttachment was monitored microscopically on days 3 7 14 30 and 49 
 he level of attachment if observed was recorded as the number of attachments per 106 Anabaena filaments mean two heterocysts per filament and the number of cells attached to each heterocyst 
 n contrast cells of WH2KT were found attached to 28 % of observed heterocysts at day 7 and 55 % at day 49 with a mean of four cells per heterocyst 
 train WH2KT belongs to a cluster of named organisms that includes H. marina LMG 128T 96.9 % similarity , H. phototrophica DFL-43T 96.7 % similarity and H. alexandrii AM1V30T 96.6 % similarity 
 ultures require aerobic growth conditions and concentrations of sea salts above 5 g l21 but below 25 g l21 optimum 15 g l21 , temperatures of 18–34 uC optimum 30 uC and pH 6.0–8.0 optimum pH 6.5 
 nalysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence demonstrated that the symbiont was most closely related to the type strain of Hoeflea marina 96.9 % similarity , which belongs to the family Phyllobacteriaceae within the order Rhizobiales of the class Alphaproteobacteria 
 he DNA G+C content of the strain was 58.1 mol % 
 he DNA G+C content of the type strain is 58.1 mol % 
 atty acids that occurred at less than 1.0 % in all four strains are not shown 2 ,1.0 %

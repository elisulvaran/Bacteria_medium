 he isolated strain, JG120-1T, grows with 0–5 % (w/v) NaCl and at 15–30 °C and pH 6–9. a-galactosidase activity test was positive 
 omparative 16S rRNA gene sequence studies showed that this strain belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria and was the most closely related to Hoeflea alexandrii AM1 V30T, Hoeflea phototrophica DFL-43T and Hoeflea marina LMG 128T (98.9, 97.9 and 97.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, respectively) 
 he isolated strain, JG120-1T, is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Hoeflea.  Materials and methods Isolation and culture conditions A sediment sample collected from the East Sea of Korea was serially diluted with filter-sterilized (0.22 lm pore size, Millipore) natural sea water containing 0.1 % yeast extract (Difco) 
 fter incubation of diluted aliquots at 25 °C under aerobic conditions for 2 weeks, the aliquot of the last dilution showing turbidity was spread onto the same medium with agar (1.5 %, w/v) which were incubated and at 25 °C for 2 weeks to obtain pure culture isolates 
 ingle colonies were purified by transferring them onto marine agar 2216 (MA; Difco) and subjecting them to additional incubation at 25 °C for 3 days 
 atalase activity was determined by bubble production in 3 % (w/v) H2O2 and oxidase activity was determined using 1 % (w/v) tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine 
 rowth at different temperatures (4, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 °C) was assessed after 3 days incubation on MA 
 rowth at different NaCl concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 %, w/v) was measured using artificial sea water (ASW; 26.4 g NaCl, 0.67 g KCl, 1.36 g CaCl22H2O, 6.29 g MgSO47H2O, 4.66 g MgCl26H2O, 0.18 g Na2CO3 per liter of distilled water) modified from Kester et al. (1967) without NaCl supplemented with 0.1 % (w/v) yeast extract 
 he following carbon sources were tested at a concentration of 1 g l-1 (acids as sodium salts): acetate, arabinose, butyrate, citrate, formate, fumarate, galactose, glucose, glutamate, glycerol, lactate, lactose, lysine, maltose, mannitol, mannose, pyruvate, sucrose, threonine, urea, xylose and yeast extract 
 he nucleotide similarity value of the 16S rRNA gene was calculated using the EzTaxon-e program (http:// www.eztaxon.org) (Kim et al. 2012).  973  Chemotaxonomic characterization Cellular fatty acids were analyzed in the isolated strain and reference strains (H. phototrophica DFL-43T, H. marina LMG128T and H. alexandrii AM1V30T) were analyzed using cultures grown on MA at 30 °C and pH 7.5 for 3 days 
 olonies of a diameter of 2–3 mm were beige, circular and convex with regular edges when grown on MA 2216 (Difco) at 30 °C for 3 days 
 train JG120-1T could grow in 0–5 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0.5–1 %) and at pH 6.0–9.0 but not at pH values below 5.5 or above 9.5 (optimum, pH 7.5)

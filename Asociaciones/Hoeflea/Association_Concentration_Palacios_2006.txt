he isolate was resistant to ampicillin, nalidixic acid and trimethoprim and sensitive to streptomycin, tetracycline, cephalothin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol.  Cell morphology of cultures (after 3–4 days incubation) was observed under a Zeiss Axioskop light microscope; phasecontrast observations were included

 uring the course of this study, a second species was described by others as belonging to the genus Hoeflea, namely Hoeflea phototrophica; it showed a somewhat higher level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with respect to strain AM1V30T (98?2 %) and was also taken into account

 liquots of the sonicated dinoflagellate cell suspension were streaked on full- and half-strength marine agar 2216 (Difco) for 7 days at 15 uC 
 or maintenance and further testing, cells were incubated in marine agar or marine broth 2216 (Difco) at 30 uC unless stated otherwise.  containing antibiotics at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 25 mg; cephalothin, 30 mg; chloramphenicol, 30 mg; erythromycin, 15 mg; nalidixic acid, 30 mg; streptomycin, 15 mg; tetracycline, 30 mg; and trimethoprim, 5 mg 
 ells were negatively stained with uranyl acetate (2 % w/v, pH 4?5) and were observed with a JEOL1010 microscope (Centro de Biologı́a Molecular, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain): monotrichous polar flagellation was observed (Supplementary Fig 
 he reactions were run on an Applied Biosystems 373S DNA sequencer.  Growth was assessed at 4, 10, 20, 30, 37, 42 and 50 uC and at pH 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 
 o assess the salinity requirements/ tolerance of strain AM1V30T, 0, 0?8, 1?5, 3, 6 and 10 % NaCl or 2?5 and 5 % sea salts (Sigma) were added to salt-free ZoBell medium, half-strength ZoBell medium and fullstrength ZoBell medium (Oppenheimer & ZoBell, 1952) 
 or comparison purposes, strain AM1V30T was also inoculated into basal medium agar consisting of 0?3 % yeast extract (Difco), 1 % Bacto-peptone (Becton Dickinson), 0?5 % NaCl (Merck) and 1?5 % agar (Pronadisa) 
 hylogenetic analysis revealed that strain AM1V30T is a member of the family Phyllobacteriaceae, its closest relatives being H. phototrophica and H. marina (98?2 and 97?4 % sequence similarity to the respective type strains) 
 evels of similarity to sequences from species of neighbouring genera were significantly lower: Mesorhizobium, 96?2–96?8 %; Phyllobacterium, 94?4– 96?2 %; Aminobacter, 95?9–96?1 %; Pseudaminobacter, 95?4–96?0 %; Nitratireductor, 95?8 %; Defluvibacter, 95?7 %; and Aquamicrobium, 95?6 %

 xperiments were run in duplicate, giving the following results: strain AM1V30T against H. marina DSM 16791T, 15?8 and 17?2 %; strain AM1V30T against H. phototrophica DSM 17068T, 29?8 and 21?3 % 
 olonies on marine agar 2216 are circular, around 1–2 mm in diameter and pigmented light brown after 2 days incubation at 30 uC 
 ptimal growth occurs at 30 uC and pH 7 
 he temperature and pH ranges for growth are 10–42 uC and pH 6–9, respectively 
 hows no specific ionic requirement, growing with salts in the range 0–11?8 % (optimally between 0 and 6?8 %) 
 n the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain AM1V30T was most closely related (97?4 % similarity) to the type strain of Hoeflea marina, which belongs to the family Phyllobacteriaceae within the order Rhizobiales of the class Alphaproteobacteria 
 ore recently, a second species within this genus was proposed, Hoeflea phototrophica (Biebl The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain AM1V30T is AJ786600 
 his micro-organism required pH values within the range 6–9, optimal growth occurring at pH 7 
 egarding salinity, growth was supported at 0 (salt-free ZoBell medium without added salts) to 11?8 % total salts (half-strength ZoBell medium plus 10 % NaCl) 
 ptimal growth occurred at 0–6?8 % total salts, indicating that strain AM1V30T must be considered as a marine organism that exhibits moderate halotolerance

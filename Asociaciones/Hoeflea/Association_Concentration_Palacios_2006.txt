 hylogenetic analysis revealed that strain AM1V30T is a member of the family Phyllobacteriaceae its closest relatives being H. phototrophica and H. marina 98 2 and 97 4 % sequence similarity to the respective type strains 
 evels of similarity to sequences from species of neighbouring genera were significantly lower Mesorhizobium 96 2–96 8 % Phyllobacterium 94 4– 96 2 % Aminobacter 95 9–96 1 % Pseudaminobacter 95 4–96 0 % Nitratireductor 95 8 % Defluvibacter 95 7 % and Aquamicrobium 95 6 %

 n the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity strain AM1V30T was most closely related 97 4 % similarity to the type strain of Hoeflea marina which belongs to the family Phyllobacteriaceae within the order Rhizobiales of the class Alphaproteobacteria 
 ore recently a second species within this genus was proposed Hoeflea phototrophica Biebl The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain AM1V30T is AJ786600 
 his micro-organism required pH values within the range 6–9 optimal growth occurring at pH 7 
 he DNA G+C content mol % was determined by HPLC at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen DSMZ Braunschweig Germany according to the procedure of Mesbah et al . 1989 
 he DNA G+C content of the type strain is 59 7 mol % 
 train AM1V30T has a DNA G+C content of 59 7 mol % which is 6 6 mol % higher than that of H. marina LMG 128T 53 1 mol % Peix et al. 2005 but almost identical to that of H. phototrophica DFL-43T ( 59 3 mol % ( Biebl et al. 2006

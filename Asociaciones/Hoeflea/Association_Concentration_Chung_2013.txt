 otal lipid profiles were detected by spraying with phosphomolybdic acid solution (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by heating at 150 uC for 10 min 
 rowth under anaerobic conditions was determined for 7 days at 30 uC in an anaerobic Gaspak jar containing an atmosphere of CO2 (Gas-Pack System; Becton Dickinson) 
 train YC6898T grew optimally at 30–37 6C and pH 6.5–7.5 
 ts closest relatives were Hoeflea alexandrii AM1V30T (96.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Hoeflea anabaenae WH2KT (95.7 %), Hoeflea phototrophica DFL-43T (95.5 %) and Hoeflea marina LMG 128T (94.8 %) 
 rowth at different temperatures (4, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 33, 37, 40, 42, 45 uC) and various pH values (pH 4.5–10.5 at intervals of 0.5 pH units) was assayed after 4 days incubation 
 rowth on nutrient agar, Luria–Bertani (LB) agar, Czapek-dox agar, trypticase soy agar (TSA), MA, MacConkey agar and R2A agar was evaluated at 30 uC after 4 days incubation 
 alt tolerance was tested in NaCl-free artificial seawater (ASW) containing 5 g peptone and 1 g yeast extract supplemented with 0–12 % (w/v, at 0.5 % intervals) NaCl after 2 days incubation at 30 uC (Kim et al., 2007) 
 lycolipids were detected with 1-naphthol spray reagent by heating at 100 uC for 3–5 min (Jacin & Mishkin, 1965).  Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 63 IP: 189.155.188.202 On: Thu, 15 Feb 2018 22:21:58  Hoeflea suaedae sp. nov.  The presence of phosphatidylcholine was detected with Dragendorff reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) 
 ased on the phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, the closest relatives of strain YC6898T were H. alexandrii AM1V30T (96.7 % similarity), H. anabaenae WH2KT (95.7 %), H. phototrophica DFL-43T (95.5 %) and H. marina LMG 128T (94.8 %) 
 olonies grown on MA at 30 uC for 2 days are 1.0–2.0 mm in diameter, white-cream, transparent, smooth, flat and circular 
 minolipids were detected by spraying the plate with 0.2 % (w/v) solution of ninhydrin in butanol saturated with water followed by heating at 105 uC for 10 min (Ross et al., 1985) 
 he phylogenetic tree based on the neighbour-joining algorithm showed that strain YC6898T formed a cluster with members of the genus Hoeflea with 88 % bootstrap support (Fig. 1) 
 he pH range for growth is 5.0–10.0 
 he range of NaCl for growth is 0–9.5 % (w/v) 
 ptimal growth occurs with 0–7 % (w/v) NaCl 
 uplicate antibiotic-sensitivity tests were done using filter-paper discs containing 30 mg tetracycline, 30 mg kanamycin, 10 mg penicillin, 10 mg streptomycin, 30 mg rifampicin, 30 mg chloramphenicol, 10 mg gentamicin, 10 mg ampicillin or 30 mg vancomycin

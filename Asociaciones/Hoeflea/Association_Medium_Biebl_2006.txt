he 16S rRNA gene sequence data suggested that the strains belonged to the order Rhizobiales and were closest (98?5 % sequence similarity) to the recently described species Hoeflea marina 
he cells contained bacteriochlorophyll a and a carotenoid, presumably spheroidenone, in small to medium amounts 
ells of the novel strains were small rods and were motile by means of single polarly inserted flagella 
ood growth occurred in complex media with 0?5–7?0 % sea salts, at 25–33 6C (optimum, 31 6C) and at pH values in the range 6–9 
ith the exception of acetate and malate, organic carbon sources tested supported poor growth or no growth at all 
n the basis of smaller cell size, different substrate utilization profile and photosynthetic pigment content, the novel strains can be classified as representatives of a second species of Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea phototrophica sp. nov. is proposed 
n a recent survey, Schwalbach & Fuhrman (2005) quantified aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAPs) by means of epifluorescence microscopy and quantitative PCR and found them to constitute 1–2 % of all bacteria in the euphotic zone off the coast of Southern California

e have recently isolated a large number of pigmented strains from different habitats of the North Sea and checked them for the presence of genes for the photosynthetic apparatus, namely the pufL and pufM genes, which code for proteins of the photosynthetic reaction centre (Allgaier et al., 2003)

n contrast to related genera and species, the novel strains in this study were able to form photosynthetic pigments, in particular bacteriochlorophyll a, if appropriate conditions were provided.  (Fig. 1c) and showed rapid movement 
hree strains (DFL-13, DFL-33 and DFL-44) were from Alexandrium lusitanicum ME207 and two strains (DFL42 and DFL-43T) were from Prorocentrum lima ME130 
ingle algal cells were washed and plated onto agar plates prepared with 10-fold-diluted Difco marine broth 2216 
trains DFL-43T and DFL-44 were selected for further characterization.  For most of the physiological tests, a complex medium was used consisting of (l21) 20 g sea salts, 3 g peptone and 0?5 g yeast extract 
he temperature range for growth was determined by using a temperature-gradient shaking incubator (Toyo Kogaku Sangyo) that allowed growth to be followed between 15 and 45 uC (at increments of 3 uC) through periodic measurement of the optical density (600 nm) 
ood growth was found between 25 and 33 uC, the optimum being at 31 uC 
he novel strains were able to grow at pH values between 5?8 and 9?5 
etween pH 6?0 and 9?0, initial culture development was almost the same 
ea salts were required at a concentration of at least 0?5 %; concentrations up to 7 % were tolerated.  Colonies of surface cultures were light-beige on full-strength marine broth 2216 (Difco) and wine-red on 10-fold-diluted marine broth

The utilization of carbon sources was checked in a mineral sea-water medium containing 0?1 g yeast extract l21 to provide the required growth factors 
he following carbon sources were tested at a concentration of 1 g l21 (acids as sodium salts): acetate, butyrate, succinate, fumarate, malate, lactate, citrate, glutamate, pyruvate, glucose, fructose, ethanol, methanol, glycerol and yeast extract 
oderate growth was obtained only with yeast extract and with acetate or malate 
he other substrates tested allowed only limited growth, with OD600 values ranging from 20 (glucose) to 60 % (fumarate, citrate) of that of the acetate culture; methanol and ethanol did not allow any growth at all 
. marina was found to use a series of sugars and sugar alcohols, including glucose (Peix et al., 2005) 
xperiments involving culture of the cells with acetate as the substrate and several additives, e.g. yeast extract (0?1 g l21), vitamin-free and vitamincontaining Casamino acids (0?25 g l21; Difco) as well as a vitamin solution (consisting of biotin, thiamine, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, vitamin B12, pyridoxine and 6aminobenzoic acid), showed that growth factors were required 
hese growth factors were provided by yeast extract, but not by any of the administered vitamins and amino acids 
he novel strains were unable to decompose or liquefy any of the following polymers: starch, alginate, gelatin and Tween 80 (for lipase activity)

olar lipids were extracted and separated by TLC according to Tindall (1990) 
or strain DFL-43T, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine were the predominant polar lipids 
oderate amounts of phosphatidylcholine and sulfoquinovosyldiacetylglycerol were present and only minor amounts of diphosphatidylglycerol and an unknown amino lipid were found 
istinct pigmentation was observed on 10-fold-diluted marine agar 2216, but not on the original medium containing (l21) 5 g peptone, 1 g yeast extract and about 30 g salts 
iquid cultures containing (l21) 3 g peptone and 0?5 g yeast extract and varied amounts of sea salts revealed that pigment production was dependent on the salt concentration 
ultures containing 3, 6 and 9 g sea salts l21 appeared  very pink, while cultures at the salt concentration of natural sea water were colourless 
he cell mass from 30 ml culture grown at 6 g sea salts l21 was extracted with 3 ml acetone/ methanol (7 : 2) and the absorption spectrum of the extract was recorded (Fig. 2) 
t showed the typical maxima of bacteriochlorophyll a at 367 and 775 nm and a high peak at 482 nm, indicating the presence of a carotenoid 
he in vivo absorption spectrum obtained by suspension of cells in 75 % glycerol showed only weak absorption in the infrared region because of the low pigment content, but peaks at around 800 and 865 nm were recognizable (not shown)

he major phenotypic differences between strains DFL-43T and DFL-44 and the species with greatest similarity in terms of 16S rRNA gene sequence, i.e 
. marina and A. kielensis, are listed in Table 3 
lthough the 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicate that the novel strains are very close to H. marina (98?5 % similarity) and more distant to A. kielensis (94?4 % similarity), there are marked phenotypic differences between the novel strains and both of these recognized species and these are also reflected in the wide range of DNA G+C contents 
trains DFL-43T and DFL44 are distinguished from H. marina and A. kielensis by possessing bacteriochlorophyll a and carotenoids, possibly enabling them to generate additional energy from light 
n addition, they differ from H. marina by their smaller cell size, by their inability to grow well in mineral media with defined organic compounds and by the presence of phosphatidylcholine 
ith respect to cell size, substrate utilization and polar lipids, however, the novel strains are more similar to A. kielensis than to H. marina 
he clear morphological and physiological differences, as well as the presence of photosynthesis reaction-centre genes and pigments, indicate that the novel isolates are representatives of a separate species, for http://ijs.sgmjournals.org  NO  2 2 + + 2 53?1  which the name Hoeflea phototrophica sp. nov. is proposed

rowth occurred under aerobic to microaerobic conditions, but not under anaerobic conditions, either in the dark or light 
hotosynthetic pigments were formed at low to medium salt concentrations, but not at the salt concentration of sea water (3?5 %) 
he type strain of Hoeflea phototrophica sp. nov. is DFL-43T (=DSM 17068T=NCIMB 14078T).  Bacterial photosynthesis appears to contribute, to some extent, to the energy generation of heterotrophs in the open oceans 
olber et al. (2001) calculated, by extrapolation from measurements of bacteriochlorophyll a in tropical seas, that up to 10 % of the bacterioplankton were potentially capable of photosynthesis 
he GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain DFL-43T is AJ582088 
he 16 strains that were positive for these genes were classified into five phylogenetic groups on the basis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences 
owever, after our phenotypic characterization of these novel strains was completed, the first description of the micro-organism Hoeflea marina was published by Peix et al. (2005) 
n the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, the novel strains were found to be more closely related to H. marina than to A. kielensis 
n strain DFL-43T, distinct capsules were visible around the cells 
oth cultures were maintained in the dinoflagellate collection of the Biological Institute of the island of Helgoland (German Bight) 
f necessary, it was replaced by a mineral medium with sodium acetate as the carbon source (Biebl et al., 2005) 
t 15 uC, the growth rate was only 1/5th of the maximum rate 
n this respect, the novel strains resemble the type strain of A. kielensis, which did not use any of the carbon sources tested (Rüger & Höfle, 1992) 
naerobic growth by the fermentation of glucose was not observed, but there was some sensitivity to full oxygen exposure, as the growth zone in agar deep culture was distinctly below the surface 
train DFL-44 had almost the same values as strain DFL-43T 
nterestingly, A. kielensis contained the same lipids, albeit in somewhat different proportions; in particular, the amount of phosphatidylethanolamine was much lower 
. marina differed from the other strains in that it lacked phosphatidylcholine

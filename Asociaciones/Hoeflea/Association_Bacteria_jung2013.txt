omparative 16S rRNA gene sequence studies showed that this strain belonged to the Alphaproteobacteria and was the most closely related to Hoeflea alexandrii AM1 V30T Hoeflea phototrophica DFL-43T and Hoeflea marina LMG 128T 98.9 97.9 and 97.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities respectively 
n the basis of polyphasic evidences it is proposed that strain JG120-1T = KCTC 23107T = JCM 16715T represents the type strain of a novel species Hoeflea halophila sp . nov

grobacterium ferrugineum LMG 128 was reclassified as Hoeflea marina gen. nov. sp . nov. within the family Phyllobacteriaceae by Peix et al . 2005 
ince this genus was proposed in 2005 Hoeflea spp . have been isolated from cultures of marine dinoflagellates and cyanobacterium H. phototrophica from a culture of Prorocentrum lima Biebl et al . 2006 , H. alexandrii from the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum AL1V Palacios et al . 2006 , H. anabaenae from heterocysts of a strain of Anabaena Stevenson et al . 2011 
Hoeflea-like bacterial strain JG120-1T was isolated from marine sediment of the East Sea Korea which may expand niche diversity of the genus Hoeflea 
he isolated strain JG120-1T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Hoeflea . Materials and methods Isolation and culture conditions A sediment sample collected from the East Sea of Korea was serially diluted with filter-sterilized 0.22 lm pore size Millipore natural sea water containing 0.1 % yeast extract Difco 
ells possessed a polar flagellum Fig . 1 and were motile which is similar to the rapid motility observed directly for Hoeflea species reported previously Biebl et al . 2006 Palacios et al . 2006 Peix et al . 2005 
he overall properties of JG120-1T are similar to those of other type strains of the genus Hoeflea . Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 2013 103:971–978 Substrate utilization profiles were determined for strain JG120-1T as well as H. alexandrii AM1V30T H. phototrophica DFL-43T and H. marina LMG128T to allow for direct comparison Table 1 and Supplementary table S1

train JG120-1T was not able to utilize butyrate galactose glucose glutamate and pyruvate while other type strains of the genus Hoeflea were able to utilize them 
mong the type strains of the genus Hoeflea strain JG120-1T was unique in that only it possessed a-galactosidase activity 
n the analysis of phylogeny strain JG1201T was determined to clearly belong to the lineage Hoeflea of the Alphaproteobacteria due to the observation of suitably high bootstrap values Fig . 2 on the phylogenetic trees of 16S rRNA gene sequences as constructed based on the neighbor–joining and the minimum evolution method algorithms . Chemotaxonomic characteristics Profiles of major cellular fatty acid of the strain JG120-1T was composed of summed feature 8 C18:1 x7c/C18:1 x6c 71.1 % , C18:1 x7c 11 methyl 15.1 % and C16:0 5.3 % ( Table 2 and its overall profiles of fatty acid were similar to those of H. alexandrii and H. phototrophica ( Table 2

ll type strains of genus Hoeflea produce Q-10 as their single respiratory lipoquinone a common feature of the majority of Alphaproteobacteria 
he presence of PG SQDG PC and PME were shared with other type strains of genus Hoeflea 
train JG120-1T did not contain an aminolipid which all reference strains contained Stevenson et al . 2011 , The G C content of genomic DNA of strain JG120-1T was 57.8 mol % which is in the range 53.1–59.7 mol % of type strains of the genus Hoeflea . 123 The absorption spectrum lacked the peaks of bacteriochlorophyll a and a carotenoid that were detected in H. phototrophica Biebl et al . 2006 
hus isolate JG120-1T could be a new species in the genus Hoeflea . Conclusions The present data demonstrated that the novel isolate designated strain JG120-1T is closely related with the genus Hoeflea 
he phylogenetic trees of 16S rRNA gene sequences generated by neighbor–joining and minimum evolution algorithms showed that the isolate was differentiated form other genera Phyllobacterium Aminobacter Aquamicrobium Defluvibacter and Mesorhizobium of the family Phyllobacteriaceae and that the strain formed a robust cluster within the genus Hoeflea Fig . 2 
espite the relatively high 16S RNA gene sequence similarity of strain JG120-1T with the most closely related species H. alexandrii AM1V30T 98.9 % and H. phototrophica DFL-43T 97.9 % , the level of DNA–DNA relatedness was sufficiently low \25 % to clearly differentiate between the new strain and the two Hoeflea species 
ifferential features in phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics from other type strains of the genus Hoeflea were also evident 
aken together strain JG120-1T should be identified as a novel species for which we proposed the name Hoeflea halophila sp . nov

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2013) 103:971–978  Substrate utilization profiles were also determined in this manner for H. alexandrii AM1V30T, H. phototrophica DFL-43T and H. marina LMG128T to allow for direct comparisons to be made

train JG120-1T was not able to utilize butyrate, galactose, glucose, glutamate and pyruvate while other type strains of the genus Hoeflea were able to utilize them 
xtracellular enzyme activities were characterized using the API ZYM kit, and the profiles were compared among all type strains in Table 1 and Supplementary table S2 
train JG120-1T was susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline and kanamycin 
he highest degrees of sequence similarity were found to be with H. alexandrii AM1V30T (98.9 %), H. phototrophica DFL-43T (97.9 %) and H. marina LMG128T 93/92  (97.0 %) 
owever, there were slight differences in the proportion of fatty acids between this study and other experimental results of H. alexandrii AM1V30T (Palacios et al. 2006), H. phototrophica DFL-43T (Biebl et al. 2006) and H. marina LMG128T (Peix et al. 2005) which may be have been caused by their different cultivation, extraction or analytical conditions 
he polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PME) (Supplementary Fig 
he presence of PG, SQDG, PC and PME were shared with other type strains of genus Hoeflea 
train JG120-1T did not contain an aminolipid which all reference strains contained (Stevenson et al. 2011), The G?C content of genomic DNA of strain JG120-1T was 57.8 mol % which is in the range (53.1–59.7 mol %) of type strains of the genus Hoeflea.  123  The absorption spectrum lacked the peaks of bacteriochlorophyll a and a carotenoid that were detected in H. phototrophica (Biebl et al. 2006) 
hus, strain JG120-1T is similar to H. alexandrii and H. marina in terms of photopigments (Palacios et al. 2006) 
NA–DNA hybridization The DNA–DNA hybridization levels of strain JG1201T with H. alexandrii AM1V30T and H. phototrophica DFL-43T were 17.5 ± 0.5 and 12.4 ± 0.2 %, respectively (Supplementary table S3) 
he phylogenetic trees of 16S rRNA gene sequences generated by neighbor–joining and minimum evolution algorithms showed that the isolate was differentiated form other genera (Phyllobacterium, Aminobacter, Aquamicrobium, Defluvibacter and Mesorhizobium) of the family Phyllobacteriaceae and that the strain formed a robust cluster within the genus Hoeflea (Fig. 2) 
espite the relatively high 16S RNA gene sequence similarity of strain JG120-1T with the most closely related species H. alexandrii AM1V30T (98.9 %) and H. phototrophica DFL-43T (97.9 %), the level of DNA–DNA relatedness was sufficiently low (\25 %) to clearly differentiate between the new strain and the two Hoeflea species 
ifferential features in phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics from other type strains of the genus Hoeflea were also evident

uring the course of this study, a second species was described by others as belonging to the genus Hoeflea, namely Hoeflea phototrophica; it showed a somewhat higher level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with respect to strain AM1V30T (98?2 %) and was also taken into account 
o confirm this conclusion, DNA–DNA hybridizations were performed: low values (between 15?8 and 29?8 %) were obtained in all cases 
train AM1V30T (=CECT 5682T=DSM 16655T) is the type strain.  The Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes (Garrity et al., 2004) indicates that the family Phyllobacteriaceae consists of eight genera representing various origins and lifestyles: Phyllobacterium (Knösel, 1984), Aminobacter (Urakami et al., 1992), Aquamicrobium (Bambauer et al., 1998), Defluvibacter (Fritsche et al., 1999), ‘Candidatus Liberobacter’ (Jagoueix et al., 1994), Mesorhizobium (Jarvis et al., 1997), Nitratireductor (Labbé et al., 2004) and Pseudaminobacter (Kämpfer et al., 1999) 
wo other genera, Parvibaculum (Schleheck et al., 2004) and Hoeflea (Peix et al., 2005), have since been proposed for consideration as members of this family, on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data 
ransmission electron micrographs of strain AM1V30T are available as a supplementary figure in IJSEM Online.  64238 G 2006 IUMS  et al., 2006), for isolates from cultures of marine dinoflagellates (three strains from Alexandrium lusitanicum and two from Prorocentrum lima) 
his study deals with the characterization of a novel isolate, strain AM1V30T, and the proposal of a novel species of the genus Hoeflea 
he specific relationship between bacteria and dinoflagellates is not well understood, but some authors consider that some of them might be symbiotic, as bacteria have been detected inside dinoflagellate cells (Cavanaugh, 1994; Lewis et al., 2001) 
train AM1V30T is able to grow axenically in vitro and it also yields blooms in cultures of the microalga from which it was isolated and of another closely related clone (AL4V)

he size and ultrastructure of the cells were determined by transmission electron microscopy (see Supplementary Fig 
ells were negatively stained with uranyl acetate (2 % w/v, pH 4?5) and were observed with a JEOL1010 microscope (Centro de Biologı́a Molecular, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain): monotrichous polar flagellation was observed (Supplementary Fig 
1).  Genomic DNA was extracted from bacterial cells and purified using the Fast DNA kit (Qbiogene) 
he 16S rRNA gene was amplified by a PCR using the primers 27f [59AGAGTTTGATC(C/A)TGGCTCAG-39] and 1492r [59-TACGG(C/T)TACCTTGTTACGACTT-39] (Lane, 1991) 
CR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was done as described by Orphan et al. (2001) and the products were sequenced directly as described by Moore et al. (1999) 
he reactions were run on an Applied Biosystems 373S DNA sequencer.  Growth was assessed at 4, 10, 20, 30, 37, 42 and 50 uC and at pH 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 
o assess the salinity requirements/ tolerance of strain AM1V30T, 0, 0?8, 1?5, 3, 6 and 10 % NaCl or 2?5 and 5 % sea salts (Sigma) were added to salt-free ZoBell medium, half-strength ZoBell medium and fullstrength ZoBell medium (Oppenheimer & ZoBell, 1952) 
n all cases, both broth and solid media were tested 
or comparison purposes, strain AM1V30T was also inoculated into basal medium agar consisting of 0?3 % yeast extract (Difco), 1 % Bacto-peptone (Becton Dickinson), 0?5 % NaCl (Merck) and 1?5 % agar (Pronadisa) 
he isolate was tested by using standard procedures (Gerhardt et al., 1994) and using the whole test spectrum of the bioMérieux API 20NE kit (for biochemical reactions) and the API ZYM kit (for extracellular enzyme activities) 
arbohydrate metabolism was investigated using API 50 CH strips (bioMérieux) in conjunction with API 50 CHB/E medium and according to the instructions of the manufacturer 
PI 50 CH strips were read after incubation for 24 and 48 h at 30 uC 
hylogenetic analysis using alternative treeing methods (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and distance matrix) and data subsets was performed using the appropriate ARB tools (Ludwig et al., 1998) 
hylogenetic analysis revealed that strain AM1V30T is a member of the family Phyllobacteriaceae, its closest relatives being H. phototrophica and H. marina (98?2 and 97?4 % sequence similarity to the respective type strains) 
evels of similarity to sequences from species of neighbouring genera were significantly lower: Mesorhizobium, 96?2–96?8 %; Phyllobacterium, 94?4– 96?2 %; Aminobacter, 95?9–96?1 %; Pseudaminobacter, 95?4–96?0 %; Nitratireductor, 95?8 %; Defluvibacter, 95?7 %; and Aquamicrobium, 95?6 %

he production of bacteriochlorophyll a by strain AM1V30T was investigated as described by Biebl et al. (2006) for H. phototrophica: the absorption spectrum lacked the peaks of bacteriochlorophyll a and a carotenoid that are found in H. phototrophica 
he values for sequence similarity with respect to the type strains of the two species of the genus, H. phototrophica and H. marina (98?2 and 97?4 %, respectively), are above the limit suggested by Stackebrandt & Goebel (1994) as defining bacterial species 
owever, given the number of phenotypic traits that differentiate strain AM1V30T and those species (see Table 2 and comments above), DNA–DNA hybridization was deemed necessary to confirm its status as a separate species

n the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, strain AM1V30T was most closely related (97?4 % similarity) to the type strain of Hoeflea marina, which belongs to the family Phyllobacteriaceae within the order Rhizobiales of the class Alphaproteobacteria 
 polyphasic approach was used to clarify the taxonomic position of strain AM1V30T 
he characteristics of the novel strain were sufficiently distinct to indicate that it represents a separate species 
hus, AM1V30T represents a novel species within the genus Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea alexandrii sp. nov. is proposed 
he genus Hoeflea was created to accommodate a single species, Hoeflea marina, based on a strain of marine origin (from the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Germany) previously assigned to the species Agrobacterium ferrugineum (Peix et al., 2005) 
ore recently, a second species within this genus was proposed, Hoeflea phototrophica (Biebl The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain AM1V30T is AJ786600

he Taq dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems) was used to sequence the 16S rRNA gene 
his micro-organism required pH values within the range 6–9, optimal growth occurring at pH 7 
o significant difference in the growth rate was observed with media employing only NaCl instead of sea salts (or sea salts plus NaCl) 
his, together with the fact that salt-free media supported growth, shows that, despite its marine origin, strain AM1V30T does not have any specific ionic requirement 
he response of strain AM1V30T to different antibiotics was tested by using filter-paper discs (Mast Diagnostics) 1992  Sequences were compared with public sequences in the EMBL gene sequence databases by using the BLAST program (National Center for Biotechnology Information; http:// ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) 
elated sequences were further analysed using the program package ARB (Ludwig et al., 2004; http:// www.arb-home.de) 
equence alignments were corrected manually using the sequence editor ARB_EDIT 
ig. 1 shows the tree derived by analysis with Jukes–Cantor corrections 
oreover, the sequence of strain AM1V30T consistently aligned with those of the two Hoeflea species, regardless of the treeing method, which means that it can be considered as a member of the same genus 
he DNA G+C content (mol%) was determined by HPLC at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ; Braunschweig, Germany) according to the procedure of Mesbah et al. (1989) 
s has been indicated above, strain AM1V30T belongs to the genus Hoeflea on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data

he 16S rRNA gene sequence data suggested that the strains belonged to the order Rhizobiales and were closest 98 5 % sequence similarity to the recently described species Hoeflea marina 
n the basis of smaller cell size different substrate utilization profile and photosynthetic pigment content the novel strains can be classified as representatives of a second species of Hoeflea for which the name Hoeflea phototrophica sp . nov. is proposed 
he type strain of Hoeflea phototrophica sp . nov. is DFL-43T =DSM 17068T=NCIMB 14078T . Bacterial photosynthesis appears to contribute to some extent to the energy generation of heterotrophs in the open oceans 
owever after our phenotypic characterization of these novel strains was completed the first description of the micro-organism Hoeflea marina was published by Peix et al . 2005

n summary the molecular data strongly suggest an affiliation of the investigated strains to the genus Hoeflea 
he clear morphological and physiological differences as well as the presence of photosynthesis reaction-centre genes and pigments indicate that the novel isolates are representatives of a separate species for http //ijs.sgmjournals.org NO 2 2 + + 2 53 1 which the name Hoeflea phototrophica sp . nov. is proposed

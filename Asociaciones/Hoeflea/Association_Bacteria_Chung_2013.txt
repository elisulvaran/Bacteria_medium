hylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain YC6898T belongs to the genus Hoeflea in the family Phyllobacteriaceae 
ts closest relatives were Hoeflea alexandrii AM1V30T 96.7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity , Hoeflea anabaenae WH2KT 95.7 % , Hoeflea phototrophica DFL-43T 95.5 % and Hoeflea marina LMG 128T 94.8 % 
n the basis of phenotypic chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis strain YC6898T represents a novel species of the genus Hoeflea for which the name Hoeflea suaedae sp . nov. is proposed 
he type strain is YC6898T 5KACC 14911T5NBRC 107700T . The genus Hoeflea was described with Hoeflea marina as the type species in the family Phyllobacteriaceae within the order Rhizobiales of the class Alphaproteobacteria with the reclassification of Agrobacterium ferrugineum LMG 128 Peix et al. 2005 
embers of the genus Hoeflea are Gram-negative aerobic non-spore-forming and halotolerant being isolated from marine sources 
t the time of writing the genus comprises four recognized species H. marina Peix et al. 2005 Hoeflea phototrophica Biebl et al. 2006 Hoeflea alexandrii Palacios et al. , 2006 and Hoeflea anabaenae Stevenson et al. , 2011 
ere we report the taxonomic characterization of strain YC6898T and show that this represents a novel species of the genus Hoeflea 
lycolipids were detected with 1-naphthol spray reagent by heating at 100 uC for 3–5 min Jacin & Mishkin 1965 .

The presence of phosphatidylcholine was detected with Dragendorff reagent Sigma-Aldrich 
he cellular fatty acid profiles of strain YC6898T and the type strains of related Hoeflea species are shown in Table 2 
he predominant cellular fatty acid was C18 1v7c 61.1 % , which was shared with other closely related members of the genus Hoeflea 
he phylogenetic tree based on the neighbour-joining algorithm showed that strain YC6898T formed a cluster with members of the genus Hoeflea with 88 % bootstrap support Fig . 1 
nalysis with the maximum-likelihood and maximum-parsimony algorithms also showed that strain YC6898T formed a phylogenetic cluster with H. anabaenae WH2KT and H. alexandrii AM1V30T within the genus Hoeflea Fig 
1 and fatty acid profiles Table 2 supported the affiliation of strain YC6898T to the genus Hoeflea in the family Phyllobacteriaceae 
e thus suggest that strain YC6898T represents a novel species of the genus Hoeflea for which the name Hoeflea suaedae sp . nov. is proposed

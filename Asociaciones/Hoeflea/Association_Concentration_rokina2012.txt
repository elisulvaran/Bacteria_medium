hen NO 3 was replaced with N2O, growth was not inhibited and was accompa nied by accumulation of N2 in the gas phase: –  NO 3  –  NO 2 — ¦  N2 O  N2 .  Growth was inhibited due to accumulation of – NO 2 , which resulted from low rates of enzymatic activity involved in the chain of reactions causing a reduction of nitrogen compounds: the activity of nitrate reductase was 30 nmol/mL per 1 mg of protein, while the activity of nitrite reductase did not exceed 0.6 nmol/mL per 1 mg of protein 
 he cultivation medium contained the following (g L–1): NaCl, 20; NH4Cl, 0.3; CaCl2 ⋅ 6H2O, 0.3; MgCl2 ⋅ 7H2O, 3; NaHCO3, 0.5; 10% phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1; Hepes buffer (pH 7.2), 3.0; KNO3, 0.3; CH3COONa, 0.15; vitamins and trace elements [12]; Difco agar, 5.0; pH 7.0 
 he cell suspension obtained on the medium with ferrous iron was pretreated with 1% oxalic acid for 3–5 min in order to dissolve iron oxides 
 ptimal growth was observed within the pH range of 6.2–8.5 (with an optimum at 7.5), at 9–38°C (with an optimum at 30°C), and in the salinity range of 0.1–8.5% NaCl (with an optimum at 1%) 
 o disintegrate bacterial cells, they were subjected three times to a freezing–thawing procedure (at –70 and 50°С, respectively); the cell suspension was then heated at 80°С for 5 min [21]

hole cell hybridizations were performed for at least 1.5 hours at 46 °C in 10 µl of a hybridization buffer containing 0.9 M sodium chloride, 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 mM TRIS/HCl (pH 8.0), the specific amount of formamide (Table 1) and 5 ng of fluorescently labelled probe for each well of the slide 
 n addition, half-strength DYGS medium was used, containing per litre: glucose (1.0 g), malate (1.0 g), yeast extract (2.0 g), peptone (1.5 g), MgSO4×7H2O (0.5 g) L-glutamic acid (1.5 g) 
 TOFFELS et al.  5.0 D,L-malic acid, 0.50 K2HPO4, 0.20 MgSO4×7 H2O, 1.0 NaCl, 0.02 CaCl2 ×2H2O, 2.0 ml bromothymol blue (0.5% solution in 0.2 M KOH), 4 ml Fe EDTA solution (1.65%), 1.0 ml vitamin solution, 2.0 ml minor element solution, 1.75 g agar, adjusted to pH 6.8 with KOH 
 he application of Azospirillum inoculants as a “green fertilizer” has been carried out with considerable success (OKON and LABANDERA-GONZALEZ, 1994). 0723-2020/01/24/01-083 $ 15.00/0  84  M 
 he JNFB-medium is very similar to the NFBmedium, but contains 1.50 K2HPO4, 2.0 agar and is adjusted to pH 6.0 with KOH (DÖBEREINER, 1995) 
 mall vessels (10 ml volume) containing 5 ml of NFb and JNFb semisolid nitrogen-free medium (DÖBEREINER, 1995) were inoculated with serial dilutions of crushed roots 
 urther purification was done on NFb and JNFb agar plates, supplemented with 50 mg yeast extract l–1 as well as on 1/2 DYGS medium agar plates 
 lant growth and inoculation Zea mays H431 cultivar seeds (provided by CIMMyT, Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo, Texcoco, Mexico) were surface sterilized with sixfold diluted household bleach (Chloramine T, 30%) for 15 min at 20 °C and 3 min in vacuum 
 he seeds were washed extensively with sterile distilled water and allowed to germinate for 3 days in sterile dish plates with wet paper in the dark at 25 °C 
 reparation of the root samples for FISH 14 days after inoculation, seedlings were carefully removed from the tubes and the roots were washed in sterile PBS

 amples were washed and dehydrated in 50, 80 and 100% ethanol (3 min each) 
 liquots of fixed reference cells were spotted on single wells, air dried and dehydrated by passing them through an ethanol series (50, 80 and 96%, v/v) for 3 min each 
 he washing buffer contained 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 0.01% SDS and depending on the hybridization stringency, between 0.056 M and 0.9 M NaCl 
 API staining For counterstaining with the DNA-binding dye DAPI (Boehringer, Mannheim) root pieces were covered with 30 µl DAPI solution (1 µg/ml in PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the dark 
 n argon ion and a helium neon laser supplied excitation wavelengths of 488, 543, and 633 nm suitable for FLUOS, Cy3, and Cy5, respectively

 his azospirilli-cluster also comprises the nitrogen-fixing, non-sulfur purple phototrophic bacterium Rhodocista centenaria (FAVINGER et al., 1989) and Skermanella parooensis (formerly Conglomeromonas parooensis subsp. parooensis; LINDSAY  88  M 
 he second cluster (subcluster II) is more heterogeneous as it contains A. irakense, A. amazonense and the phototroph Rhodocista centenaria 
 ince the database contains only a selection of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences (isolates and clones) and our current knowledge of microbial diversity is still very limited, it is advisable for most of the applications to apply the hybridization conditions as stringent as possible.  90  M 
 herefore, the probes AZO440a and AZO440b should be used together at a formamide concentration of 50% for a reliable in situ identification of all bacteria belonging to the genera Azospirillum, Skermanella and Rhodocista (Azospirillicluster) 
 elected non-target bacteria, such as Thermus silvanus, Magnetospirillum magnetotacti and Flavobacterium mizutaii with representative mismatch constellations showed no hybridization under stringent hybridization conditions.  92  M 
 t a formamide concentration of 35% and an equimolar amount of Alila1113+C, hybridization signals of A. brasilense cells were decreased to the low level of autofluorescence, while the A. lipoferum and A. largimobile target cells still yielded strong signals 
 robe Ahalo1115 and the competitor Ahalo1115C show the desired specificity at a formamide concentration of 45%, but the sensitivity for this probe was significantly lower than for the probe Ahalo1249 
 pecific hybridization is readily achieved at the recommended formamide concentration of 65% (Table 3). • Skermanella parooensis: To complete the probe set for the Azospirilli-cluster we also tested several diagnostic 16S rRNA regions for S. parooensis: Sparo1402, Sparo127, Sparo66 and Sparo84

 fter incubation for 2, 4, 6, or 8 hours at room temperature, the seedlings were rinsed by dipping them twice into sterile distilled water

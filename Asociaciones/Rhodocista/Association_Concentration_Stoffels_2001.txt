 ince the database contains only a selection of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences isolates and clones and our current knowledge of microbial diversity is still very limited it is advisable for most of the applications to apply the hybridization conditions as stringent as possible . 90 M

 oth probes AZO440a and AZO440b yielded strong hybridization signals with the target cells in the presence of up to 50 % formamide in the hybridization buffer followed by a significant decline of the signal intensity at 55 % formamide 
 nder stringent hybridization conditions 50 % formamide the probe AZO440a yielded good signals with all tested target organisms and as expected also with the Azospirillum irakense and A. amazonense strains which have one weakly destabilising G-U mispairing in the target region 
 herefore the probes AZO440a and AZO440b should be used together at a formamide concentration of 50 % for a reliable in situ identification of all bacteria belonging to the genera Azospirillum Skermanella and Rhodocista Azospirillicluster 
 elected non-target bacteria such as Thermus silvanus Magnetospirillum magnetotacti and Flavobacterium mizutaii with representative mismatch constellations showed no hybridization under stringent hybridization conditions . 92 M 
 t a formamide concentration of 35 % and an equimolar amount of Alila1113+C hybridization signals of A. brasilense cells were decreased to the low level of autofluorescence while the A. lipoferum and A. largimobile target cells still yielded strong signals 
 robably this mismatch can not be discriminated at the applied stringency of 35 % formamide and Bacteroides putredinis might also be detected by the probe Alila1113 
 he competitor is one nucleotide shorter than the probe Abras1420 and is 100 % complementary to the A. lipoferum strains ATCC 29707T NCIMP 11861 and EBI F and to Bartonella spp. Phylobacterium spp. Nanobacterium sp . and Wolbachia melophagi 
 he combination of Abras1420 and Abras1420C enables reliable whole cell identification of A. brasilense with an addition of 45 % formamide to the hybridization buffer . • A. halopraeferens For the design of specific probes for the species A. halopraeferens only the sequence of the type strain was available 
 or good signal strength and specific hybridization conditions probe Ahalo1249 should be used together with the competitor at 60 % formamide 
 robe Ahalo1115 and the competitor Ahalo1115C show the desired specificity at a formamide concentration of 45 % but the sensitivity for this probe was significantly lower than for the probe Ahalo1249 
 ll non-target bacteria have at least two mismatches to the probe sequence and can be discriminated at the recommended stringency 50 % formamide . • A. irakense-cluster Probes Airak985 and Airak1423 are complementary to target sites identified to be specific for the A. irakense-cluster 16S rRNA E. coli positions 9851003 and 1423-1440 by the PROBE DESIGN tool 
 or specific and bright hybridization probe Airak985 and Airak1423 should be used with 35 % and 10 % formamide in the hybridization buffer respectively . • Rhodocista centenaria The genus Rhodocista comprises the species Rhodocista centenaria IAM 14193T and the Design and Application of New 16S rRNA-targeted Oligonucleotide Probes two isolates MT-Sp-2 and MT-Sp-3 KAWASAKI et al. 1992 
 pecific hybridization is readily achieved at the recommended formamide concentration of 65 % Table 3 . • Skermanella parooensis To complete the probe set for the Azospirilli-cluster we also tested several diagnostic 16S rRNA regions for S. parooensis Sparo1402 Sparo127 Sparo66 and Sparo84

 fter 2 weeks the plants reached a height of approx . 10 cm 
 fter incubation for 2 4 6 or 8 hours at room temperature the seedlings were rinsed by dipping them twice into sterile distilled water 
 robe evaluation In situ hybridization conditions for the new oligonucleotide probes were optimised by gradually increasing the formamide concentration in the hybridization buffer as previously described AMANN et al. 1996 
 nly sequence positions which share common residues in at last 50 % of all available sequences from α-subclass proteobacteria were included for the calculation of this tree 
 tringency of hybridizations were gradually increased by the addition of deionized formamide in 5 % increments 
 inding of probe AZOI to these bacteria could be prevented by addition of at least 50 % formamide to the hybridization buffer

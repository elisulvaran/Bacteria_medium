Mexico Received January 11 2001 Abstract The genera Azospirillum Skermanella and Rhodocista form a phylogenetic subgroup within the alfa subclass of Proteobacteria 
t comprises probes for the whole genus cluster Azospirillum-Skermanella-Rhodocista for the Azospirilli subcluster I including A. lipoferum A. doebereinerae A. largimobile A. brasilense and A. halopraeferens for the Azospirilli subcluster II including A. amazonense A. irakense and the genus Skermanella for the genus Rhodocista as well as for all Azospirilli species or species cluster 
he new probes allow a fast and reliable in situ identification of bacteria belonging to the Azospirillum-Skermanella-Rhodocista-cluster at different phylogenetic levels 
he specificity of the new probes was tested with 56 strains of the Azospirillum-Rhodocista-Skermanella-cluster and selected reference cells from other genera by hybridising with the complete probe set 
n addition applications of the fluorescently labelled probes for in situ identification of isolates and for the in situ localisation of A. brasilense on maize roots were demonstrated using confocal laser scanning microscopy 
zospirilli have a worldwide distribution and can be isolated from tropical subtropical and temperate zones of the world 
hey occur in association with roots stems and leaves of a large variety of gramineous and non-gramineous plants e.g . numerous wild and cultivated grasses and cereals legumes vegetables and fruit trees BASHAN and HOLGUIN 1997 GUNARTO et al. 1999 HAN and NEW 1998 WEBER at al. 1999 
zospirilli are in the centre of scientific interest for the last two decades because under appropriate conditions members of this genus can enhance plant development and promote the yield of several agriculturally important crop plants 
he mechanisms by which plant growth promoting rhizobacteria PGPR support the growth of plants have not been elucidated completely but several possible modes of action have been proposed 1 stimulation of the growth of the entire root system which results in enhanced mineral and water uptake SAUBIDET and BARNEIX 1998 2 biological nitrogen fixation which directly contribute nitrogen to the plant 3 bacterial production and release of phytohormones including auxins gibberellins and cytokinins OKON and VANDERLEYDEN 1997 that play an essential role in plant growth stimulation in general BASHAN and HOLGUIN 1997 4 bacterial nitrite production which increase the formation of lateral roots BOTHE et al. 1992 ( 5 displacement of plant pathogens i. e. fungi and bacteria by antimicrobial activity ( RODELAS et al. , 1999 SHAH et al. , 1992 BASHAN and HOLGUIN , 1997

TOFFELS et al . Besides the development of commercial Azospirillum inoculants Azospirilli are also under discussion for the industrial production of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate for medical use OKON and ITZIGSOHN 1992 production of vitamins RODELAS et al. 1993 DAHM et al. 1993 for the degradation of pollutants RUSSEL and MUSZYNSKI , 1995 , purification of urban residual water and the breakdown of cellulose in combination with cellulolytic bacteria BASHAN and HOLGUIN , 1997 
acteria of the genus Azospirillum are Gram-negative nitrogen fixing rods and comprise of 7 species A. lipoferum A. irakense A. halopraeferens A. brasilense A. amazonense A. largimobile formerly A. largomobile and Conglomeromonas largomobilis subsp . largomobilis and the recently described A. doebereinerae ECKERT et al. 2001 
ogether with the nitrogen-fixing non sulfur purple phototrophic bacteria Rhodocista centenaria and the non nitrogen-fixing Skermanella parooensis formerly Conglomeromonas largomobilis susp . parooensis the genus Azospirillum forms a phylogenetic subgroup within the alfa-subclass of Proteobacteria Azospirilli subcluster 
or both the agriculturally and industrial applications of Azospirillum reliable and rapid identification as well as monitoring tools are necessary 
hese include traditional physiological methods DOEBEREINER 1995 and serological and molecular determinations KIRCHHOF et al. 1997 
ifferent techniques are available for direct in situ identification and localisation of Azospirilli on inoculated roots 
SSMUS et al . 1997 used fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes and antibodies in combination with confocal scanning laser microscopy for the in situ localisation of A. brasilense on wheat roots 
CHLOTER and HARTMANN 1998 applied strain-specific fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibodies and immunogoldlabelling for the localisation of A. brasilense strains on the surface and inside wheat roots 
urthermore reporter genes like NifA-lacZ KATUPITIYA et al. 1995 nifH-gusA VANDE BROEK et al. 1993 and a bi-functional gfp- and gus A- containing mini-Tn5 transposon XI et al. , 1999 were successfully used to locate A. brasilense on wheat roots 
owever reporter gene constructs are only useful for model inoculation trials and monoclonal antibodies are only available for certain A. brasilense strains 
he described oligonucleotide probes targeting the 23S KIRCHHOF and HARTMANN 1992 or 16S rRNA KABIR et al. 1995 are only partly suitable for whole cell fluorescence in situ hybridizations and some of these probes are not specific 
luorescently labelled probes were applied for a rapid identification of isolates and in situ localisation of A. brasilense Cd on maize roots using confocal laser scanning microscopy .

hree subclusters could be distinguished within the Azospirilli-cluster Fig . 1 : The first group comprises A. lipoferum A. largimobile A. doebereinerae A. brasilense and A. halopraeferens subcluster I 
he second cluster subcluster II is more heterogeneous as it contains A. irakense A. amazonense and the phototroph Rhodocista centenaria 
owever applying a maximum likelyhood analysis Skermanella parooensis clusters together with A. amazonense A. irakense and R. centenaria 
onsequently as a compromise a consensus tree was used and the inconsistency or uncertainty was visualized by multifurication LUDWIG et al . 1998 
his was supported by the fact that S. parooensis – as the only member of this cluster – is unable to fix nitrogen and to form scarlet coloration of colonies on Congo red containing medium DEKHIL et al. 1997 . Re-evaluation of previously published oligonucleotide probes The 16S and 23S rRNA databases as well as the number of species known were considerably enlarged during the last years 
recent database check using the Probe Match tool of the software package ARB STRUNK and LUDWIG 1997 revealed that these probes are no longer species specific 
robe Aba for example once designed to detect A. brasilense and A. amazonense is also 100 % complementary to Magnetospirillum gryphiswalde Leptonema illini Clostridium celluolosi Methanococcus aeolicus and the recently described A. doebereinerae 
n addition probe Al originally targeted to the 16S rRNA of A. lipoferum is not species-specific because – according to the current sequence data – this probe is also complementary to the respective target sites of Ricketsia akari and Sphingomonas adhaesiva 
ccording to current sequence data all three probes are complementary to members of phylogenetically not coherent groups and therefore they are not phylogenetically meaningful 
herefore it can not be recommended to use these probes for identification purposes . 89 Besides the 16S rRNA directed probes several probes targeting the 23S rRNA of Azospirilli were described KIRCHHOF and HARTMANN 1992 such as the genus-specific probe AZO23S the species-specific probes AA for A. amazonense AB for A. brasilense AH for A. halopraeferens AL for A. lipoferum , AI for A. irakense 
database check with about 550 published and unpublished complete and partial 23S rRNA sequences confirmed for the species-specific probes that all non target organisms have at least two mismatches to the target organisms and therefore can be discriminated during hybridizations 
ince the number of 23S rRNA sequences available from databases is still very limited the PROBE MATCH can only be a hint for the specificity and the real specificity of these probes has to be checked performing extensively hybridization experiments with both phylogenetically closely related and also distinct reference bacteria STOFFELS et al. 1998 
he specificity of the probes described by KIRCHHOF and HARTMANN 1992 were only tested with a very limited set of reference organisms and therefore further experiments would be necessary 
he genus specific probe AZO23S is a mixture of four sequence variations and has only one weak mismatch with some non target organisms e. g 
hodobacter capsulatus and Bradyrhizobium japonicum 
owever he also mentioned that the signal intensity of this probe is low and therefore only a limited application of this probe in environmental samples is possible 
oth probes are targeted to the 16S rRNA and a database check revealed that they show the desired specificity . Design of new oligonucleotide probes and evaluation of specific hybridization conditions Probe design and specificity analysis were performed by using an ARB sequence database containing a total of about 10.000 complete and partial 16S rRNA sequences and the ARB-tools PROBE DESIGN and PROBE MATCH 
ll probe sequences target positions hybridization conditions and specificities are given in Table 2 
n overview of the probes and their specificities is presented in Figure 1 
he specificity of the probes was tested by whole cell hybridizations with fluorochrome labelled-probes and representative reference organisms Table 3 
he formamide concentrations recommended as optimal in Table 2 are the highest that still yield good signals with the target cells and additionally allow a discrimination of non target cells 
ince the database contains only a selection of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences isolates and clones and our current knowledge of microbial diversity is still very limited it is advisable for most of the applications to apply the hybridization conditions as stringent as possible . 90 M

he suggested probe AZO440a matches perfectly with all A. brasilense A. lipoferum A. halopraeferens S. parooensis and Rhodocista centenaria sequences 
he sequences of A. amazonense and some A. irakense strains have one weakly destabilizing G-U mispairing whereas the Azospirillum strains Asp1 DSM 4835 and DSM 4834 which belong to the A. irakense cluster Fig . 1 , have one strongly destabilising C-A mismatch 
robe AZO440a for the detection of most of the Azospirilli strains and probe AZO440b that differ only in target position 444 for the detection of the strains Asp1 DSM 4835 and DSM 4834 
he specificities of the probes were tested by whole cell hybridization with fluorochrome-labelled probes and representative reference organisms 
oth probes AZO440a and AZO440b yielded strong hybridization signals with the target cells in the presence of up to 50 % formamide in the hybridization buffer followed by a significant decline of the signal intensity at 55 % formamide 
bviously stable hybrids between the probes and the target sequences were no longer formed at higher formamide concentrations 
nder stringent hybridization conditions 50 % formamide the probe AZO440a yielded good signals with all tested target organisms and as expected also with the Azospirillum irakense and A. amazonense strains which have one weakly destabilising G-U mispairing in the target region 
herefore the probes AZO440a and AZO440b should be used together at a formamide concentration of 50 % for a reliable in situ identification of all bacteria belonging to the genera Azospirillum Skermanella and Rhodocista Azospirillicluster 
elected non-target bacteria such as Thermus silvanus Magnetospirillum magnetotacti and Flavobacterium mizutaii with representative mismatch constellations showed no hybridization under stringent hybridization conditions . 92 M 
TOFFELS et al . Probes for the Azospirilli-subclusters Probe AZOI-655 was designed for the detection of A. lipoferum A. largimobile A. doebereinerae A. brasilense and A. halopraeferens that form a separate subcluster within the Azospirilli-cluster Azospirilli-subcluster I 
he target site for the probe is the 16S rRNA position 655 to 672 E. coli numbering BROSIUS et al. 1981 that is identical and specific for all species of this subcluster 
he probe design tool was not able to identify a common 16S rRNA sequence specific for A. irakense A. amazonense and R. cetenaria 
he Azospirillisubcluster III comprises only the species Skermanella parooensis . Probes at species levels • A. lipoferum A. largimobile and A. doebereinerae These species are very closely related within the Azospirillisubcluster I 
or A. doebereinerae two probes Adoeb94 and Adoeb587 that are accessible for in situ hybridizations are available ECKERT et al. 2001 
t a formamide concentration of 35 % and an equimolar amount of Alila1113+C hybridization signals of A. brasilense cells were decreased to the low level of autofluorescence while the A. lipoferum and A. largimobile target cells still yielded strong signals 
robably this mismatch can not be discriminated at the applied stringency of 35 % formamide and Bacteroides putredinis might also be detected by the probe Alila1113 
ytophaga uliginosa which has two weakly destabilising mismatches G-U and T-G with the probe target region displayed no fluorescence signals . • A. brasilense The PROBE DESIGN tool suggested the 16S rRNA position 1420 to 1438 as a diagnostic region for a species-specific probe for A. brasilense 
he A. lipoferum strains ATCC 29707T NCIMP 11861 and EBI F have only one weakly destabilising G-U mismatch at position 5 of the target region 
he competitor is one nucleotide shorter than the probe Abras1420 and is 100 % complementary to the A. lipoferum strains ATCC 29707T NCIMP 11861 and EBI F and to Bartonella spp. Phylobacterium spp. Nanobacterium sp . and Wolbachia melophagi 
he combination of Abras1420 and Abras1420C enables reliable whole cell identification of A. brasilense with an addition of 45 % formamide to the hybridization buffer . • A. halopraeferens For the design of specific probes for the species A. halopraeferens only the sequence of the type strain was available 
fter comparative sequence analysis position 1115-1133 and 1249-1266 of the 16S rRNA of A. halopraeferens were chosen as target sites for the probes Ahalo1115 and Ahalo1249 
he competitor Ahalo1249C is complementary to all A. lipoferum strains and to A. largimobile whereas Ahalo1115C blocks A. doebereinerae 
or good signal strength and specific hybridization conditions probe Ahalo1249 should be used together with the competitor at 60 % formamide 
robe Ahalo1115 and the competitor Ahalo1115C show the desired specificity at a formamide concentration of 45 % but the sensitivity for this probe was significantly lower than for the probe Ahalo1249 
t is targeted to the same 16S rRNA as the probe Ahalo1249 and it also yielded bright and strong hybridization signals 
ll non-target bacteria have at least two mismatches to the probe sequence and can be discriminated at the recommended stringency 50 % formamide . • A. irakense-cluster Probes Airak985 and Airak1423 are complementary to target sites identified to be specific for the A. irakense-cluster 16S rRNA E. coli positions 9851003 and 1423-1440 by the PROBE DESIGN tool 
his cluster comprises the A. irakense strains KBC1 103312 and ASP-1 and the Azospirillum sp . strains DSM 4834 and DSM 4835 
trains DSM 4834 and DSM 4835 were deposited on the basis of their nitrogen fixing ability morphology and physiological characteristics at the DSMZ as Azospirillum sp . XIA et al. 1994 
hey have an overall 16S sequence similarity of 97.6 and 98.0 with the A. irakense type strain 
or specific and bright hybridization probe Airak985 and Airak1423 should be used with 35 % and 10 % formamide in the hybridization buffer respectively . • Rhodocista centenaria The genus Rhodocista comprises the species Rhodocista centenaria IAM 14193T and the Design and Application of New 16S rRNA-targeted Oligonucleotide Probes two isolates MT-Sp-2 and MT-Sp-3 KAWASAKI et al. 1992 
pecific hybridization is readily achieved at the recommended formamide concentration of 65 % Table 3 . • Skermanella parooensis To complete the probe set for the Azospirilli-cluster we also tested several diagnostic 16S rRNA regions for S. parooensis Sparo1402 Sparo127 Sparo66 and Sparo84 
urprisingly the Cy3-labelled probes Sparo1402 Sparo127 and Sparo66 yielded no detectable binding to whole fixed cells of S. parooensis even though the target sites for these probes were shown to be accessible at the 16S-rRNA of E.coli for FISH FUCHS et al. 1998 
hese results support the conclusions by FUCHS and coworkers 1998 that the accessibility of probe target sites in other bacteria could be different to the situation in E. coli 
t this stringency the sensitivity in whole cell hybridizations is very good and the specificity was as expected 
kermanella parooensis is described as a bacterium which exhibits unicellular and multicellular phases of growth 
ulticellular conglomerates arise from single cells which lose motility become optically refractile and reproduce by multiplanar centripetal septation 
nterestingly the multicellular aggregates yielded strong hybridization signals with the rRNA targeted fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes Sparo84 and AZO440a+b whereas the single cells showed only weak or no fluorescence signals Fig . 2 C 
bviously cells from the multicellular growth phase are physiologically more active because the signal intensity of in situ hybridizations correlate with the cellular rRNA content and growth rates of the target cells AMANN et al. 1995 
n alternative explanation is that the cell peripheries of the unicellular phase cells are modified and may hinder the access of oligonucleotides to their target sites 
he conglomerates displayed remarkable autofluorescence but its intensity was significantly below the probe conferred fluorescence . Specificity and application of the new probes To test the specificity of the new probes 57 strains of the Azospirillum-Rhodocista-Skermanella-cluster were hybridized with the complete probe set 
ll strains hybridized with the genus-cluster probe AZO440a+b and except one GSF 31 , all strains could be identified with the species or species-cluster probes Table 3 
ll probes showed the desired specificity and no cross reactions of the species and species-cluster probes could be observed 
he hybridization results fit very well with the description of the strains based on physiological and molecular approaches 
SM 1726 and Azospirillum sp 
ccording to our hybridization results and the previously published results from ECKERT et al . 2001 this strain should be grouped to the newly described species A. doebereinerae 
he two strains DSM 1727 and DSM 1726 were received from the DSMZ Braunschweig Germany as Azospirillum sp 
omparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis performed by XIA et al . 1994 revealed that the two strains were missclassified and did not cluster with the other Azospirilli 
ISH with oligonucleotide probes for the alfa- beta- and gamma-subclasses of Proteobacteria MANZ et al. 1992 and the new probe set for the Azospirilli-cluster indicates that there is probably a confusion with the two strains 
owever it hybridized with probe ALF1b which is specific for the alfa-subclass of Proteobacteria some members of the delta subclass of Proteobacteria and most Spirochaetes 
bviously it is a mixed culture of alfa- and gamma-subclass Proteobacteria 
he cells hybridizing with the probe ALF1b also showed strong hybridization with the probes AZO440a+b specific for the genera Azospirillum Skermanella and Rhodocista the probe AZOI-655 specific for the Azospirilli cluster I and the probe Alila-1113 
o confirm these results we ordered the strains twice from the DSMZ and obtained the same hybridization results 
mixture of A. lipoferum DSM 1691 A. brasilense DSM 1858 and A. amazonense DSM 2787 was hybridized with FLUOSlabelled probe Aama1250 specific for A. amazonense Cy3labelled probe Alila1113 specific for A. lipoferum and A. doebereinerae and Cy5-labelled probe Abras1420 for the detection of A. brasilense 
he new probe set is a good tool for the fast and reliable screening of isolates by whole cell hybridization

n artificial mixture of the isolate GSFB3 from banana roots A. lipoferum DSM 1841 and A. amazonense DSM 2787 was simultaneously hybridized with the nested probe set AZO440a+b-Cy3 specific for the Azospirillum-Rhodocista-Skermanella-cluster AZOI-655-FLUOS specific for the species cluster A. lipoferum A. brasilense A. largimobile and A. halopraefens and the probe Abras1420-Cy5 which is specific for A. brasilense 
he paraformaldehyde fixed overnight culture was simultaneously hybridized with the Cy3-labelled probe Sparo84 specific for S. parooensis and the Cy5labelled probe AZO440a+b specific for the Azospirillum-Skermanella-Rhodocista-cluster 
he oligonucleotide probes allow the detection of both the unicellular and multicellular phases of growth

or the in situ detection of A. brasilense a top to bottom approach was performed using the nested probe set EUB338 FLUOSlabelled , ALF1b Cy3-labelled and the new probe AZO440a Cy5-labelled 
hey can be used for whole cell and in situ hybridization of these bacteria 
he nested design of the oligonucleotides enables a reliable and fast identification of bacteria belonging to the Azospirillum-Skermanella-Rhodocista-cluster on different phylogenetic levels 
acteria of the genus Azospirillum are important plant growth promoting rhizobacteria PGPR and are applied as inoculants 
owever up to now little information is available about the survival growth and the metabolic activity of the inoculated bacteria in the environment 
he new probe set will allow to gain more fundamental insights into the fate and population dynamics of inoculants 
n the basis of these results beneficial and ecologically competent bacterial strains can be defined and the inoculation strategies may be improved

ey words Azospirillum – Rhodocista – Skermanella – fluorescence in situ hybridization – FISH – 16S rRNA – top to bottom approach – identification – monitoring Introduction Bacteria belonging to the genus Azospirillum are frequently studied nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria 
ost recently FANCELLI et al . 1998 described the development of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers for the detection of Azospirillum strains in soil 
his study presents a comprehensive set of new 16S rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes in a nested design for the secure identification of bacteria belonging to the Azospirillum-Skermanella-Rhodocista-cluster on different phylogenetic levels 
ll other strains were cultivated as outlined in the respective catalogues of strains DSMZ-Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen Braunschweig Germany ACM-Australian Collection of Microorganisms Department of Microbiology The University of Queensland St 
ucia Australia ATCC-American Type Culture Collection Manassas VA USA LMG-Culture Collection of the Laboratorium voor Microbiologie Universiteit Gent Gent Belgium 
fter 2 weeks the plants reached a height of approx . 10 cm 
fter incubation for 2 4 6 or 8 hours at room temperature the seedlings were rinsed by dipping them twice into sterile distilled water 
he remaining water was removed from the roots by putting the roots on a sterile adsorbent towel 
fter being dried the root pieces were stored at room temperature 
ybridizations Hybridizations were performed on glass slides with six wells for independent positioning of the samples 
fter air drying the slides were mounted with Citifluor anti bleaching agent AF1 Citifluor Ltd. Canterbury UK 
or the hybridization of root pieces the protocol was slightly modified 
robe evaluation In situ hybridization conditions for the new oligonucleotide probes were optimised by gradually increasing the formamide concentration in the hybridization buffer as previously described AMANN et al. 1996 
or the documentation of the hybridization results the confocal laser scanning microscope Zeiss LSM 510 Jena Germany was used 
he data were converted to a postscript file with the software package Corel Draw Version 5.0 Corel Corp. USA 
o define phylogenetically mean- ingful groups it was necessary to calculate a tree including all 16S rRNA sequences available for the Azospirilli as basis for the probe design 
omparative sequence analysis revealed that the species of the genus Azospirillum are members of a phylogenetic subgroup of the α-subclass of Proteobacteria 
nly sequence positions which share common residues in at last 50 % of all available sequences from α-subclass proteobacteria were included for the calculation of this tree 
ultifurcations indicate branches for which a relative order of the branching can not unambiguously be determined or a common order is not supported applying different treeing methods 
or the sake of clarity only a selection of the reference sequences is shown 
t has to be noted that the position of this species within the azospirilli-cluster could not be determined unambiguously applying alternative treeing methods 
erforming a neighbour joining analysis Skermanella parooensis clusters with the first Azospirilli-subgroup as described by DEKHILL et al . 1997 
ith a maximum parsimony analysis it clusters on a very short branch outside the Azospirilli lineage 
n the consensus tree S. parooensis represents a separate branch within the Azospirilli-cluster 
s a consequence probes described on a more limited dataset no longer show the desired specificity AMANN et al. 1996 
herefore it is necessary to regularly check the specificity of oligonucleotide probes 
ABIR et al . 1995 described three probes for the identification of Azospirillum strains by radioactive colony hybridization 
he probe Ai originally designed for the specific detection of A. irakense KABIR et al. 1995 , shows identical target regions within the 16S rRNA of more than 20 other species from different phyla 
herefore this probe can not be recommended for the identification of the genus Azospirillum anymore 
urthermore up to now the in situ accessibility of the 23S rRNA targeted probes was only shown for probe AB by ASSMUS et al . 1995 
ecently ECKERT et al . 2001 published two probes for the specific detection of a new Azospirillum species A. doebereinerae by FISH 
tringency of hybridizations were gradually increased by the addition of deionized formamide in 5 % increments 
t has to be noted that some of the probes also showed specific hybridization signals at lower stringency

onsequently two probes for the Azospirilli-cluster were constructed 
he hybridization conditions for the probe AZO440a were adjusted in such a way that Azospirillum strains with weakly destabilising mismatches should be detected by this probe whereas non-target organisms with at least three mismatches should be discriminated 
inding of probe AZOI to these bacteria could be prevented by addition of at least 50 % formamide to the hybridization buffer 
he situation was different for the Azospirilli-subcluster II 
his reflects the phylogenetic heterogeneity of the subcluster II 
ased on 16S rRNA sequence analysis no relative branching order for these three species could unambiguously be determined as reflected by a multifurcation in the tree Figure 1 
e developed the probe Alila1113 for the species cluster A. lipoferum-A . largimobile 
he probe has only one central C-A mismatch with the non target sequences of A. brasilense strains 
s described by NEEF et al . 1998 for a probe for the phylum Planctomyces this mismatch constellation is insufficient for full discrimination without a competitor able to capture the 16S rRNA of these organisms 
herefore we constructed the competitor Alila1113C to block the probe binding sites of non-target A. brasilense strains 
acteroides putredinis contains only one weakly discriminating base change U-G at position 9 of the target region position 121 in E. coli numbering 
owever when this probe is used in a top to bottom approach together with the here described probes AZO440a+b and/or AZOI a misidentification is excluded 
herefore to increase the specificity of the probe it should be used together with the competitor Abras1420C 
his is certainly a disadvantage for the application in environmental samples 
bviously the tested A. halopraeferens strains comprise a homogenous set of strains . • A. amazonense The probe Aama1250 was developed for the specific detection of A. amazonense 
t represents nitrogen-fixing phototrophic bacteria of the Azospirilli-cluster 
or the specific detection of this genus the probe Rhodo654 was designed 
ince S. parooensis AUS 2042 is the only Skermanella parooensis isolate described until now more isolates will be necessary to proof whether the probe Sparo84 is species or genus specific 
n interesting observation could be made during the hybridization experiments with Skermanella reference cells 
nly for the strains GSF21 Azospirillum sp 
SM 1727 the results differ 
IRCHHOF et al . 1997 had identified the strain GSF21 by radioactive dot blot hybridization with the 23S-rRNA targeted probe AL as A. lipoferum 
n our hands DSM 1727 did not hybridize with the probe GAM42a which is specific for the gamma-subclass of Proteobacteri 
further analysis revealed that the strain belongs to the alfa subclass of Proteobacteria but not to the Azospirilli-cluster 
or the strain DSM 1726 the situation was more difficult 
herefore the cells could be grouped to the A. lipoferum-A . largomobile-cluster 
he cells belonging to the gamma subclass of Proteobacteria were not further characterised 
ISH could clearly differentiate between the three species by giving red A. lipoferum , green A. amazonense or blue fluorescence A. brasilense conferred by the probes 
e used it together with the probe ALF1b for the screening of 130 nitro- 94 M 
Top to bottom approach for the whole cell identification of the nitrogen fixing banana isolate GSFB3 
ells of the isolate GSFB3 are detected by all three probes resulting in a white staining of the cells 
he phase contrast image was superimposed with the two epifluorescence panels by image analysis 
In situ detection of A. brasilense Cd at the root surface of an inoculated wheat seedling grown in a hydroponic system with quarz sand 
ll other isolates did not belong to the Azospirilli-cluster 
igantheus using nitrogen free-semisolid media could be assigned to the A. lipoferum-A . largmobile cluster by FISH 
n important application of the new probes is the in situ identification of inoculated or naturally occuring Azospirilli in the rhizosphere 
ince A. brasilense cells hybridized with all three probes used a white image is acquired which is easily detectable in the plant tissue Fig . 2D . Conclusion The newly developed oligonucleotide probes greatly improve the existing probes for the Azospirillum-cluster 
pplication of rRNA-targeted probes in combination with probes specific for genes involved in the expression of phenotypic traits or together with antibodies against surface exposed or cytoplasmatic enzymes could combine phylogenetic identification with functional analysis LUDWIG et al. 1998 ASSMUS et al. 1997 
his technique will also be a promising opportunity for obtaining cultivation independent information about the role of indigenous or inoculated plant growth promoting bacteria in the rhizosphere

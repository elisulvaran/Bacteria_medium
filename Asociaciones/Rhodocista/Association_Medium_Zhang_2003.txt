hina Correspondence Shuang-Jiang Liu shuangjiang @ hotmail.com A novel bacterial species Rhodocista pekingensis sp . nov. was isolated from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and characterized by polyphasic taxonomy 
ells of R. pekingensis were Gram-negative motile by a single polar flagellum vibrioid to spiral 0 6–0 8 mm in width and 0 8–1 5 mm in length 
hototrophically grown cells contained lamellar photosynthetic membranes and bacteriochlorophyll a 
hiamin and vitamin B12 but not biotin were required for growth and 0 05 % yeast extract stimulated growth 
cetate lactate pyruvate and succinate supported growth 
his facultative nature of phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria has led to their widespread distribution in rivers lakes oceans and soil 
hototrophic bacteria play important roles in the bioconversion of organic matters and the biocycling of elements such as carbon nitrogen and sulfur in these environments 
hototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria are also commonly isolated from wastewater treatment plants Hiraishi & Ueda 1994 and references cited therein 
piral-shaped phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria were included in the genus Rhodospirillum Trüper & Imhoff 1989 before the proposal of the species Rhodocista centenaria Kawasaki et al. 1992 and Rhodospira trueperi Pfennig et al. 1997 
s more phototrophic bacterial strains were isolated and more information on the phenotypes and genotypes particularly 16S rDNA sequences of these and other previously described strains became Published online ahead of print on 20 December 2002 as DOI 10.1099/ijs.0.02500-0 
he establishment of the genus Rhodocista was based mainly on the results of 16S rDNA sequences and also on its unique cyst-producing morphology and cellular quinone Q-9 
ntil now R. centenaria has been the only species of the genus Rhodocista and the type strain ATCC 43720T was isolated from hot springs in Wyoming USA Favinger et al. 1989 
he isolate was characterized as a mesophilic phototrophic bacterium that produces cysts and possesses Q-9 as the major quinone 
hylogenetic and phenotypic characterization of this isolate indicated that it is a novel species of the genus Rhodocista for which the name Rhodocista pekingensis is proposed . METHODS Bacterial strains media and cultivation

rowth physiological and biochemical characteristics Strain 3-pT was facultatively anaerobic and heterotrophic 
hen cultivated anaerobically in the light strain 3-pT grew at 25–44 uC with an optimum between 31 and 42 uC this strain differs from Rhodocista centenaria in that the latter has an optimal growth temperature of 39–45 uC 
hiamin and vitamin B12 were required for growth 
yruvate lactate acetate glutamate aspartate and succinate supported growth 
mmonium salts and glutamate were used as nitrogen sources

riefly strain 3-pT assimilated succinate needed thiamin for growth had an optimal growth temperature between 31 and 42 uC and no R-bodies were seen in cells whereas Rhodocista centenaria did not assimilate succinate needed biotin rather than thiamin for growth had an optimal growth temperature of 39–45 uC and R-bodies did occur in cells

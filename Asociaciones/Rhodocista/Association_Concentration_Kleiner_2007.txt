 omparative physiological characterization of Rhodocista centenaria R. pekingensis and T4 Growth tests with different C 36.5 mm or N 18 mm sources see Table I were carried out at 30 ∞C in liquid cultures under aerobic heterotrophic 5 ml on a rotary shaker or anaerobic phototrophic conditions 8 ml screw cap bottles without gas phase illumination by a tungsten lamp with the medium as described above omitting NH4Cl when testing N sources and omitting acetate when testing C sources 
 yst formation of T4 Cyst formation was induced as described by Berleman and Bauer 2004 by aerobic mainte- nance for several days at 42 ∞C on plates containing NH4Cl and butyrate as N and C sources , respectively 
 xpression of pigments as function of oxygen content in the gas phase was assessed by incubation under 0 2.5 5 8 10 15 and 20 % O2 in the light 
 hen testing for vitamin requirement the vitamin solution Trüper and Imhoff 1989 was omitted as well . Miscellaneous techniques Absorption spectra were recorded using intact cells grown under phototrophic conditions and resuspended in a 60 % sucrose solution

 ther properties of strain T4 Vegetative cells of T4 had a vibroid to rod shape with dimensions of 0.7 ¥ 2 μm under aerobic Fig . 2a and 0.7 ¥ 4 μm under anaerobic growth conditions Fig . 2b 
 n vivo absorption spectra of anaerobically cultivated cells showed maxima at 410 480 510 590 800 and 875 nm indicative of the presence of bacteriochlorophyll a and spirilloxanthin-like pigments 
 erobic growth in liquid cultures 5 ml on a rotary shaker was conducted with cells pre-grown in an ammonium/acetate medium and washed twice with water to remove all nutrients 
 ight microscopic appearance of Rhodocista T4 stained with carbol fuchsin after growth at different conditions a after aerobic cultivation for 3 d in liquid ammonium/acetate medium 30 ∞C ; b after anaerobic cultivation for 3 d in liquid ammonium/acetate medium 30 ∞C ; c after 1 d on ammonium/butyrate plate 42 ∞C ; d after 2 and 3 d on ammonium/butyrate plate 42 ∞C ; e after 3 d or more on ammonium/butyrate plate ( 42 ∞C . nium butyrate medium and supplied with 10 % NaCl

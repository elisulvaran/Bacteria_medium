aterials and Methods Isolation and characterization of T4 Phototrophic bacteria were enriched from a waste water pond [depth 1.5 m, pH 7.6 ð 0.4, 28 ∞C, organic load (1200 ð 600) mg/l BOD (biological oxygen demand), 3Ð6 mg/l sulfide] in Laphu, Hoaiduc, HaTay province (Vietnam) by anaerobic growth in light in screw cap tubes or bottles filled with a medium containig (g/l): KH2PO4 (1.0); MgCl2 · 6H2O (0.5); CaCl2 · 2H2O (0.1); NH4Cl (1); NaCl (1); NaHCO3 (1); Na-acetate (3); 1 ml vitamin solution; 1 ml trace element solution (Trüper and Imhoff, 1989); at pH 6.8Ð7.2 
 omparative physiological characterization of Rhodocista centenaria, R. pekingensis and T4 Growth tests with different C (36.5 mm) or N (18 mm) sources (see Table I) were carried out at 30 ∞C in liquid cultures under aerobic heterotrophic (5 ml on a rotary shaker) or anaerobic phototrophic conditions (8 ml screw cap bottles without gas phase, illumination by a tungsten lamp) with the medium as described above, omitting NH4Cl when testing N sources, and omitting acetate when testing C sources 
 yst formation of T4 Cyst formation was induced as described by Berleman and Bauer (2004), by aerobic mainte-  nance for several days at 42 ∞C on plates containing NH4Cl and butyrate as N and C sources, respectively 
 ther properties of strain T4 Vegetative cells of T4 had a vibroid to rod shape with dimensions of (0.7 ¥ 2) μm under aerobic (Fig. 2a) and (0.7 ¥ 4) μm under anaerobic growth conditions (Fig. 2b) 
 erobic growth in liquid cultures (5 ml on a rotary shaker) was conducted with cells pre-grown in an ammonium/acetate medium and washed twice with water to remove all nutrients 
 n contrast to other Rhodocista, T4 does not require any supplines like vitamins (Table II).  Characteristic Vitamin requirement Optimum growth temperature [∞C] Cell diameter ¥ length pH Optimum  Miscellaneous Apart from vitamin requirement other characteristic differences are listed in Table II 
 naerobic growth in liquid cultures (8 ml screw cap bottles without gas phase) was conducted with cells treated as above

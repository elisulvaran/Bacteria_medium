he nucleic acids were precipitated by adding 150 ul of 10 M ammonium acetate and 700,u1 of isopropyl alcohol 
 he cells (ca. 0.1 g, wet weight) harvested and washed once with TMK buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.6, containing 10mM magnesium acetate and 25 mM KCl) were suspended in 500 it of TMK buffer and lysed on 0.04% (w/v) chicken egg white lysozyme at 37°C for 10 min 
 he strains which we examined for l6S rRNA sequencing were "Rhodospirillum centenum" TAM 14193T (= ATCC 437201), two isolated strains, MT-SP-2 and MT-SP-3, Rhodopseudomonas palustris ATCC 17001'and Erythrobacter longus JCM 6170T. "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193Tand the two isolates were grown on SA medium (8,9) that contained (per liter) 1.0 g of sodium acetate, 1.0 g of sodium succinate, 0.5 g of KH2P04, 0.6 g of K2HP04, 1.0 g of (NH4)2504, 0.2 g of Mg504 7H20, 0.2 g of NaCI, 0.05 g of CaCh •2H,0, 0.1 g of Na2S203 5H,0, 0.1 g of yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich., U.S.A.), 1ml of vitamin mixture and 1 ml of trace element solution, pH 6.8 
 he vitamin mixture was composed of 50 mg of thiamine hydrochloride, 50 mg of niacin, 30 mg of p-aminobenzoic acid, 10 mg of pyridoxine hydrochloride, 5 mg of biotin and 5 mg of vitamin BI, per 100ml 
 he trace element solution was composed of 1.0 g of disodium EDTA, 2.0 g of FeC13.6H20, 0.1 g of ZnCI,, 0.1 g of MnCl2.4H20, 0.1 g of H3B03, 0.1 g of CoC12 H,0, 20 mg of Na2Mo04 2H2O, 10 mg of CuC12.2H20, 10mg of NiC12' 6H20 and  1992  Rhodocista centenariagen.nov.,sp. nov.  543  5 mg of Na2SeO3per liter. "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14913Twas grown at 40°C 
 or the determination of the quinone system and the guanine-plus-cytosine (G+C) content of DNA, "Rhodospirillum centenum" JAM 14193T and the two isolates were cultivated in 300 ml broth in 500 ml conical flask with cotton plug 
 or cyst formation, cultures were grown aerobically on the agar medium containing 0.3% yeast extract (Difco) and 0.2% Casamino Acids (Difco), pH 6.8, in the dark 
 he mixture was added with 200~cl of phenol solution (14) and 200,u1 of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24: 1, v/v), vigorously shaken for 2 min on a Vortex and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 min 
 iving cells show absorption maxima at 800, 875 and 587 nm 
 ith butyrate as the sole carbon source, the spiral-shaped cells are converted to cysts which are desiccation- and heat-resistant; the filter-fixed cysts kept at the temperature of 55°C for 2 days are viable

 uinones were detected with the spectrophotometer Lambda-Max Model 481 LC (Millipore Corp., Waters Chromatography Division) at 275 nm 
 urthermore, the organism had G + C content of 69.9 mol (68.3 mol% (3)) that differed from the G + C content of 60.5-65.8% (Bd) or 62.163.5 mol% (Tm) of the other Rhodospirillum species (27) except for Rhodospirillum salinarum (68.3%) 
 he DNA was decomposed by incubation with 1 L.dof DNase I (6080 U/Ll, Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) at 30°C for 15 min

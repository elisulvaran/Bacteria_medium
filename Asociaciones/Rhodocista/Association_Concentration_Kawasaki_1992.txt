 omparative analysis of the presently determined sequences and the reference sequences 1,107 bases revealed that the three cyst-forming organisms belonged to the a group of the class Proteobacteria and were distantly related to Rhodospirillum rubrum the type species a-1 subgroup 89.9 % homology and the representative members of other subgroups ( a-2 -3 and -4 ( 87.6-89.8 % homology 
 he strains which we examined for l6S rRNA sequencing were `` Rhodospirillum centenum '' TAM 14193T = ATCC 437201 two isolated strains MT-SP-2 and MT-SP-3 Rhodopseudomonas palustris ATCC 17001'and Erythrobacter longus JCM 6170T . `` Rhodospirillum centenum '' JAM 14193Tand the two isolates were grown on SA medium 8,9 that contained per liter 1.0 g of sodium acetate 1.0 g of sodium succinate 0.5 g of KH2P04 0.6 g of K2HP04 1.0 g of NH4 2504 0.2 g of Mg504 7H20 0.2 g of NaCI 0.05 g of CaCh •2H,0 0.1 g of Na2S203 5H,0 0.1 g of yeast extract Difco Laboratories Detroit Mich.

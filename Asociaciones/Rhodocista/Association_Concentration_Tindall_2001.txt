he authors correctly indicate that both the names Rhodospirillum centenum and Rhodocista centenaria were assigned the same priority number ‘ 2 ’ which one may infer means that the request for valid publication of both names was received on the same day 
 owever since the name Rhodocista is derived from the Greek rhodos l red and Latin cista l basket meaning the ‘ red basket ’ there should be no confusion , because the name does not mean the ‘ red cyst ’ 
 f ATCC 43720 l IAM 14193 is considered to be a member of the genus Rhodospirillum then it must be called Rhodospirillum centenum Favinger et al . 1994 but should it be placed in another genus then it must be called Rhodocista centenaria Kawasaki et al . 1994

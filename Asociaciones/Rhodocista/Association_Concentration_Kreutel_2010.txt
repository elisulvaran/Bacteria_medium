 fter 30 minutes at room temperature, the unbound proteins were removed by washing the column five times with 500 μl buffer I followed by an elution with 1.5 ml buffer II (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.7, 200 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole pH 8.0) 
 he absorption maximum of a prototypical cinnamic acid chromophore in a Pyp light sensor is at about 450 nm [40], whereas the phytochrome-linked biliverdin absorbs red light, suggesting that the latter could function as an attractant sensor 
 hemotaxis assay using a chemotactic chamber  2 ml minimal medium A (MMA) [56] containing an amino acid mixture (threonine, leucine, histidine, methionine), vitamin B1 (final concentration 10 μg/ml each), 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2% fructose were inoculated with an overnight culture of E. coli MM500 or cells harbouring pBAD-Pph, pBAD-PphH670A, pBAD-KdpE or pBAD18, respectively 
 ngelmann and also Manten [8] found that R. rubrum cells accumulated in the most intense area of light gradients between wavelengths 800 and 900 nm 
 n solid media, the phototactic colonies move towards longwave light and away from light with wavelengths less than 650 nm [10] 
 B swarm agar plates, containing either arabinose or fructose were inoculated with the respective cells, incubated for 6 hours at 37°C and the swarm diameters were compared (Figure 2B)

 ncreasing concentrations of purified Rc-CheW were added and the binding was recorded during 30 minutes

 ecently, Cusanovich and co-workers showed that the holo-Ppr of R. centenaria has absorption maxima at 425 nm (Pyp), 400, 642 and 701 nm (phytochrome) [36] corresponding to the typical absorption spectrum of Pyp [40] and phytochromes [41] 
 he interaction of Pph and Rc-CheW was also observed in vitro with purified components showing a strong affinity with a KD of about 130 nM (Figure 5) 
 n contrast to the trimeric Tsr-CheA-CheW complex that is formed in E. coli with an affinity of about 3 μM [16] we observed that the complex formation of Pph and RcCheW is clearly ATP-dependent (Figure 4B) 
 or E. coli, antibiotics were added at final concentrations of 200 μg/ml ampicillin, 10-50 μg/ml kanamycin and 5 μg/ml gentamycin and for R. centenaria 5 μg/ml gentamycin, 10 μg/ ml kanamycin

 herefore, a low CI indicates an undisturbed chemotactic response whereas a high CI reflects an inhibition of the E. coli chemotactic system.

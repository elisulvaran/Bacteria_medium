ecause of the importance of some photosynthetic bacteria viable efficient and environment-friendly biological remediation researches have therefore become inevitably important 
n search of these criteria there was the need for the logical merger of efficacy of the mop-up capability of the biological agents and productive beneficial end-results 
esults showed a positive response to four of the toxic chemical compounds with the production of 65±5 mg/L 63±3 mg/L 59±3 mg/L and 53±6 mg/L yields of raw bacteriocarotenoid in DMSO Methanol Isopropyl alcohol and Dubai crude respectively when compared with 65±3 mg/l of raw bacteriocarotenoid produced in the Control experiment 
our of the toxic compounds were efficient to trigger carotenogenic processes needed in the production of beneficial bacteriocarotenoids two were mild and two others were inadequate to trigger a substantial process 
he improvement in carotenoid production with the assimilated toxic chemicals corroborated the efficiency of the Inductive Toxic-mopping Bioremediation pattern and beneficial convertibility of chemical wastes by Rhodocista pekingensis 
otential man-made disasters may be looming over the continent as more of the dangerous chemicals and their derivatives are dumped in wrong places with impunity 
he oxidation-reduction or “ Redox ” of pollutant chemicals with their component elements therefore have become a focal point for Clinical Researchers Biologists and Environmental Scientists in which phototrophic bacteria play important roles 
herefore the bio-cycling of dangerous compounds and bioconversion of other organic matters by this group of bacteria in a manner that favors the eco-systems and the coexistence of all biological beings that share the planet Earth become more logical 
iologically bacteria are very important in environmental bioremediation and rehabilitation especially in cheap treatment of waste water and other waste treatment systems 1 [ 2 
he non-sulfur phototrophic bacterium Rhodocista pekingensis and many bacteria species in this group are facultative and grow either as anaerobic phototrophic under appropriate lighting condition or aerobic chemotrophic in the dark 3 [ 4 [ 5 
he anaerobic productions of bacteriocarotenoids through microbial oxidation-reduction processes have placed some bacterial species in unique positions in medical and health research 
esults of direct enzymatic activities of Rhodocista pekingensis were confirmation of the ability to transform toxic chemicals in beneficial ways either anaerobically or otherwise under appropriate growth environment and conditions . II . Materials And Methods 2.1 Bacterial culture and maintenance This thermophilic strain of Rhodocista pekingensis UKMP-WA was cultured in malate yeast extract MYE broth as previously described 1 [ 6 [ 4 
he bacterial cells were observed by light and phase-contrast microscopes DOI 10.9790/2402-09110104 www.iosrjournals.org 1 | Page Inductive toxic-mopping it-m and carotenogenic bioconversion properties of thermotolerant BX60 Olympus microscope , scanning electron microscopy SEM and ultrathin observations of bacterial cells were carried out as described and previously reported 4 1 [ 7 . 2.2 Toxic-mopping and assimilation trial Toxic-mopping was carried out as outline by Akinnuoye et al [ 4 and minor modifications briefly described below Fifteen milliliter volume of MYE broth was dispensed into 50mL-sized bottles with screw caps 
ive milliliters of culture was inoculated into the broth medium and incubated as previously cited 2.1 
eak-specific detection of bacteriochlorophylls in living cells and carotenoid extraction was done by spectrophotometric scanning of 1 mL of 14-day old broth culture at 600 nm for bacteriochlorophyll and at 480 nm wavelengths for carotenoid extract using Cary 50® spectrophotometer Cary Australia

he growth of Rhodocista pekingensis as tabulated Table 1 was equally normal with Dimethyl sulfoxide Isopropyl alcohol Methanol and Dubai crude heavy crude oil 
he growth with Amine and Ethyl benzene was mildly supported while Cumime and Isoamyl alcohol were less supportive to the growth of Rhodocista pekingensis and cellular bacteriocarotenoid production

ubsequent yields were 65±5 mg/L 63±3 mg/L 59±3 mg/L and 53±6 mg/L of raw bacteriocarotenoids in DMSO Methanol Isopropyl alcohol and Dubai crude respectively Table 1 
he multiple peak detections were in the regions of 350 and 374 others were detected between 442 and 453 461 and 478 while some were between 495 and 503 nm wavelengths in the spectral range of 300 to 700 nm while the wavelength range for Bchl was between 400 to 1200nm Fig . 2 .

he results of chemical convertibility tests showed proportional increase in biomass production and resultant reciprocal high carotenoid yield Table 1 Fig . 2 
t was apparent from the OD0.5 measurements bacteriochlorophyll analysis and yields of bacteriocarotenoids that there was a synchronized sequence of the pigment densities with bacteriocarotenoid yields of the bacterium 
n other word Rhodocista pekingensis efficaciously metabolized and/or degraded dimethyl sulfoxide isopropyl alcohol crude oil and methanol with increase in biomass and subsequently increase in beneficial carotenoid production by the phototrophic bacterium 
hese assertions were corroborated by previous findings in which phototrophic bacteria were used in water treatment and in other bioremediation processes 9 [ 10 [ 11 
edical use of Rhodocista pekingensis was discovered in the ability of carotenoids of bacteria origins which have been known to be of immense advantage especially in antioxidant and anticarcinoma studies 11 [ 12 
owever there was no significantly detectable change in both the external and the ultrathin structures of the bacterium as all the composite features were intact and appeared normal as in the controls of the trials 
he photosynthetic materials and other intracellular materials did not display any physiological distortion 
n other word the possibility of the organism to remain active till most or all recovery is done is certain . IV . Conclusions The prospects and the benefits of the bacteriocarotenoid produced by Rhodocista pekingensis through metabolic bioconversion are still being explored 
owever it could be concluded that the convertibility of toxic chemical compounds and wastes can not be overemphasized 
he use of Rhodocista pekingensis in environmentally related cleansing and remediation coupled with the ability of the bacterium to translate the clean-up capability into medically beneficial bye-products such as carotenoids was overwhelmingly plausible 
inally the use of this bacterium in the treatment of environmental pollution attributable to lethal chemicals pollutants and their derivatives were evident and could be adopted in future studies on environmental bioremediation and rehabilitation

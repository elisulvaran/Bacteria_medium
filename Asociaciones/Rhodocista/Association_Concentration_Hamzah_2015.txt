he bacterial cells were observed by light and phase-contrast microscopes DOI: 10.9790/2402-09110104  www.iosrjournals.org  1 | Page  Inductive toxic-mopping (it-m) and carotenogenic bioconversion properties of thermotolerant (BX60 Olympus microscope), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and ultrathin observations of bacterial cells were carried out as described and previously reported [4][1][7]. 2.2 Toxic-mopping and assimilation trial Toxic-mopping was carried out as outline by Akinnuoye et al [4] and minor modifications briefly described below: Fifteen milliliter volume of MYE broth was dispensed into 50mL-sized bottles with screw caps 
 ive milliliters of culture was inoculated into the broth medium and incubated as previously cited (2.1) 
 eak-specific detection of bacteriochlorophylls in living cells and carotenoid extraction was done by spectrophotometric scanning of 1 mL of 14-day old broth culture at 600 nm for bacteriochlorophyll and at 480 nm wavelengths for carotenoid extract using Cary 50Â® spectrophotometer (Cary Australia) 
 he multiple peak detections were in the regions of 350 and 374; others were detected between 442 and 453, 461 and 478, while some were between 495 and 503 nm wavelengths in the spectral range of 300 to 700 nm while the wavelength range for Bchl was between 400 to 1200nm (Fig. 2).

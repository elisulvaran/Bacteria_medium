onclusions: The Ppr protein of Rhodocista centenaria directly interacts with the chemotactic protein CheW 
his suggests a role of the Ppr protein in the regulation of the chemotactic response in addition to its role in chalcone synthesis.  Background Rhodocista centenaria, first described as Rhodospirillum centenum [1] is a thermotolerant phototrophic purple bacterium of the a-proteobacteria group isolated from hot springs in Wyoming 1985 
owever, 16S rRNA analysis elucidated considerable differences between the species, hence Rhodocista was separated into a new genus [3], now consisting of three species [4,5] 
n the mutant Pph H670A the putative autophosphorylated histidine residue (H670) is replaced by an alanine.  on chemotaxis is caused by a reduced growth rate due to the heterologous expression of the Rhodocista proteins, growth curves of induced and non-induced and empty plasmid control cells were recorded and compared

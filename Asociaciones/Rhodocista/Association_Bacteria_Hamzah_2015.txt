 (Jan. 2015), PP 01-04 www.iosrjournals.org  Inductive Toxic-Mopping (IT-m) and Carotenogenic Bioconversion Properties of Thermotolerant Rhodocista pekingensis Sp 
e studied the previously identified thermophilic species of photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodocista pekingensis isolated from a local hot spring in Malaysia 
nductive Toxic-mopping (IT-m) technique was used to assess the production of bacteriocarotenoids by metabolic bioconversion process of eight toxic chemical compounds by Rhodocista pekingensis 
he improvement in carotenoid production with the assimilated toxic chemicals corroborated the efficiency of the Inductive Toxic-mopping Bioremediation pattern and beneficial convertibility of chemical wastes by Rhodocista pekingensis 
ey words: Bacteriocarotenoid, Toxic-mopping, Bioremediation, Carbon emission, Rhodocista  I.  Introduction  With the increase in greenhouse emission and high amount of toxic chemical wastes, the world is becoming a more dangerous place to live in 
he non-sulfur phototrophic bacterium Rhodocista pekingensis and many bacteria species in this group are facultative and grow either as anaerobic phototrophic under appropriate lighting condition or aerobic chemotrophic in the dark [3][4][5] 
esults of direct enzymatic activities of Rhodocista pekingensis were confirmation of the ability to transform toxic chemicals in beneficial ways either anaerobically or otherwise under appropriate growth environment and conditions.  II.  Materials And Methods  2.1 Bacterial culture and maintenance This thermophilic strain of Rhodocista pekingensis (UKMP-WA) was cultured in malate yeast extract (MYE) broth as previously described [1][6][4] 
ontrol.  III.  Results And Discussion  Pigmentation in Rhodocista pekingensis was deep pinkish to reddish color in MYE broth 
ltrathin cell observations revealed intracytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 1)  a b c Figure 1: Metabolic assimilation by Rhodocista pekingensis showing (a) reddish pigmented growth (b) Gram negative cells and (c) flagellated negatively-stained cell 
he growth of Rhodocista pekingensis as tabulated (Table 1) was equally normal with Dimethyl sulfoxide, Isopropyl alcohol, Methanol and Dubai crude (heavy crude oil) 
he growth with Amine and Ethyl benzene was mildly supported while Cumime and Isoamyl alcohol were less supportive to the growth of Rhodocista pekingensis and cellular bacteriocarotenoid production 
he multiple peak detections were in the regions of 350 and 374; others were detected between 442 and 453, 461 and 478, while some were between 495 and 503 nm wavelengths in the spectral range of 300 to 700 nm while the wavelength range for Bchl was between 400 to 1200nm (Fig. 2).

n other word, Rhodocista pekingensis efficaciously metabolized and/or degraded dimethyl sulfoxide, isopropyl alcohol, crude oil, and methanol with increase in biomass and subsequently increase in beneficial carotenoid production by the phototrophic bacterium 
edical use of Rhodocista pekingensis was discovered in the ability of carotenoids of bacteria origins which have been known to be of immense advantage especially in antioxidant and anticarcinoma studies [11][12] 
n other word, the possibility of the organism to remain active till most or all recovery is done is certain.  IV.  Conclusions  The prospects and the benefits of the bacteriocarotenoid produced by Rhodocista pekingensis through metabolic bioconversion are still being explored 
he use of Rhodocista pekingensis in environmentally related cleansing and remediation coupled with the ability of the bacterium to translate the clean-up capability into medically beneficial bye-products such as carotenoids was overwhelmingly plausible

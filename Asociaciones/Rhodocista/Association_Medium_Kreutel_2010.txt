hereas the role of the CheY-domain of the CheAY protein in H. pylori seems to be a phosphate sink, in R. centenaria, the function of Rc-CheAY remains still unclear

fter 30 minutes at room temperature, the unbound proteins were removed by washing the column five times with 500 μl buffer I followed by an elution with 1.5 ml buffer II (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.7, 200 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole pH 8.0) 
he large fusion protein Ppr consists of three functional domains, an Nterminal Pyp domain with the cinnamic acid chromophore, the central phytochrome-like bilin attachment domain Bbd and the C-terminal histidine kinase domain Pph which autophosphorylates an essential histidine residue [22] 
 Ppr-deletion mutant lacking amino acid residues 114-750 did not show any alterations in phototactic behaviour, instead exhibited a strongly deregulated expression of the chalcone synthase gene suggesting a regulatory function in the polyketide synthesis [22]

t exists as a long fusion protein, designated Ppr, consisting of three domains, the Pyp domain, a putative bilin binding domain (Bbd) and a histidine kinase domain (Pph) 
he Ppr protein is involved in the regulation of polyketide synthesis but it is still unclear, how this is connected to phototaxis and chemotaxis 
esults: To elucidate the possible role of Ppr and Pph in the chemotactic network we studied the interaction with chemotactic proteins in vitro as well as in vivo 
urther results indicated that the Pph histidine kinase domain and CheW may form a complex with the chemotactic kinase CheAY suggesting a role of Ppr in the chemotaxis signalling pathway

he chemotaxis gene cluster has been well characterized and most of the genes are similar to those of other Gram negative bacteria like Escherichia coli 
or adaptation, CheB and its antagonist CheR remove or add methyl groups to the receptors, respectively 
n R. centenaria, the two central components of the chemotactic signal transduction cascade, namely CheA and CheY, are present as the fusion protein Rc-CheAY located in the first chemotactic operon [17], a situation that is also observed in Helicobacter [18] 
n the last decade, bacterial photoreactive proteins like phytochromes, previously thought to be a unique feature in plants, have been identified as photoactive yellow proteins (Pyp) and have now been extensively studied in a variety of eubacterial species (for review see [20,21]) 
or R. centenaria, a Pyp-like protein, Ppr, was described in 1999 by Bauer and colleagues [22] 
lthough some Pyp proteins have been crystallized and biophysically characterized in great detail (reviewed by [21]), no distinct physiological role could be attested to these unique proteins 
e therefore analysed whether the Ppr protein and in particular its  Page 2 of 15  phosphorylating kinase domain Pph interacts with the Rc-Che proteins.  Results The chemotactic response of E. coli is inhibited by the expression of Ppr  The chemotactic network in E. coli is very sensitive to alterations in the expression level and stoichiometry of the chemotactic proteins Ec-CheW [23,24] and Ec-CheA [25] as well as the MCP receptors [26,27] 
o this end, the plasmids pBAD-Ppr, pBADPph and pBAD-PphH670A encoding the entire photoreceptor Ppr, the C-terminal histidine kinase domain Pph and the mutant PphH670A protein, respectively (Figure 1), were used to transform E. coli MM500 
irst, protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-blue staining 
B swarm agar plates, containing either arabinose or fructose were inoculated with the respective cells, incubated for 6 hours at 37°C and the swarm diameters were compared (Figure 2B) 
he chemotactic response of the wild type strain E. coli MM500 without or with the empty pBAD vector was clearly visible by the formation of a swarming ring (lower left and central panels) 
n these cases no swarm rings were visible (upper left and central panels) 
he histidine residue at 670 of Pph is a putative phosphorylation site and is located in a H-box region [29] 
ll strains were also analyzed on swarm plates containing 0.2% fructose that did not induce the expression of the Ppr proteins and did not significantly affect the size of the swarming rings (Figure 2B) 
he Ppr protein consists of a photoactive yellow protein domain (Pyp; residues 1-135) which carries the blue light absorbing chromophore p-hydroxycinnamic acid, a central bacteriophytochrome bilin binding domain (residues 136-601) with the red light absorbing biliverdin chromophore, and a histidine kinase domain (Pph; residues 602-884) 
n the mutant Pph H670A the putative autophosphorylated histidine residue (H670) is replaced by an alanine.  on chemotaxis is caused by a reduced growth rate due to the heterologous expression of the Rhodocista proteins, growth curves of induced and non-induced and empty plasmid control cells were recorded and compared 
. coli MM 500 was transformed with pBAD-Pph and pBADPphH670A, respectively 
he cells were grown in minimal medium A (MMA) containing 0.2% fructose as a carbon source, and the heterologous protein expression was induced by the addition of arabinose when the culture reached an optical density of 0.6 
orroborating the results with the swarm plates shown in Figure 2B, the expression of the Pph-H670A mutant  protein lead to an only reduced chemotactic inhibition of 0.58 and did not reach the wild type CI value 
ur results indicate that the chemotactic inhibition increases with time and depends on the amount of Pph protein expressed 
he cellular protein level of Pph was verified in parallel by SDS-PAGE and Westernblot analysis (data not shown) 
he Pph protein interacts with Rc-CheW in an ATPdependent manner  To investigate in detail with which components of the Rc chemotactic pathway Ppr and its C-terminal histidine kinase domain Pph interact, the binding to Rc-CheW or Rc-CheA was analyzed 
irst, purified R. centenaria CheW (Rc-CheW) containing an N-terminal his-tag and in vitro translated and radiolabelled Pph protein were tested for interaction by matrix-assisted coelution

fter intensive washing the bound protein was eluted, separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by autoradiography 
t should be considered that in all experiments a low ATP level (2 mM) is required to allow in vitro transcription and translation 
o calculate the dissociation constant (K d ) of the binding between the histidine kinase domain Pph and Rc-CheW, resonant mirror spectroscopy experiments with a biosensor cuvette system were performed 
or these experiments Pph with a C-terminal strep-tag and an N-terminal his-tag was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Cu-IMAC) 
n  aminosilane cuvette was activated and coated with streptactin 
ncreasing concentrations of purified Rc-CheW were added and the binding was recorded during 30 minutes 
he amount of bound Rc-CheW and the fractional saturations ( p ) were calculated for each experiment and the data were displayed in a plot against the added Rc-CheW concentration (Figure 5) 
 hyperbolic binding curve was revealed and the dissociation constant was calculated to Kd = 0.13 ± 0.03 μM 
herefore, the binding of the histidine kinase domain Pph to Rc-CheW of R. centenaria appears to be stronger than the binding between the histidine kinase Ec-CheA and Ec-CheW that has been analysed in E. coli [31] 
he histidine kinase Pph is present in a complex with RcCheW and Rc-CheAY  Since the chemotactic MCP receptor proteins in E. coli and Rhodobacter sphaeroides were found in heterooligomeric complexes together with CheW and CheA [32-34], we investigated whether the Pph protein can bind to Rc-CheAY in the presence of Rc-CheW 
ulldown experiments with purified Rc-CheW containing an N-terminal his-tag and in vitro translated and radioactively labelled Pph and Rc-CheAY proteins were performed (Figure 6) 
he translation reaction with added Rc-CheW protein was incubated overnight and loaded  Kreutel et al 
urified Pph protein was immobilized on an aminosilane cuvette and increasing amounts of Rc-CheW were added 
fter 30 minutes of incubation the free protein was removed and the bound Rc-CheW was calculated 
nbound proteins were removed by extensive washing steps and the specificly bound proteins were eluted by imidazol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining and autoradiography 
n addition to the CheAY and Pph protein bands at the expected positions, smaller bands were detected that presumably result from incomplete translation of Pph and Rc-CheAY, respectively 
he results indicate that a complex composed of Rc-CheW, CheAY and the histidine kinase domain Pph may be formed in vitro 
s control experiments, the proteins were analysed in the absence of Rc-CheW (lanes 3 and 6) showing no elution of Pph or Rc-CheAY.  Taken together, the results give preliminary evidence that the C-terminal histidine kinase domain Pph of the photosensor protein Ppr assembles in vitro into a trimeric complex of Pph, Rc-CheW and Rc-CheAY 
nvZ, KdpD and PhoR) identifies a predicted dimerization motif in the N-terminal part of Pph 
he Pph sequence shows an identity of 27% and a similarity of about 57% compared to the dimerization domain of EnvZ (Figure 7A) 
rude soluble extracts of Pph expressing E. coli cells were separated on a Sephadex G-200 column and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Westernblotting 
n vitro translated [35S]methionine radiolabelled Pph and Rc-CheAY proteins were mixed with purified CheW-6his, incubated at 37°C and bound to Cu-Sepharose 
fter extensive washing the complexes were eluted and the fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue (A) or by autoradiography (B) 
he reactions containing the in vitro translated protein in total are shown in lanes 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13 
he last washing steps are shown in lanes 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14 and the elution fractions in lanes 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 
he positions of molecular weight markers are indicated.  molecular weight form of Pph was found in fraction 22/ 23 above the exclusion limit of the column (200 kDa) and contains most likely higher aggregates which were also previously observed with Ppr [36,37] 
wo protein bands with a molecular weight of about 35 and 70 kDa, respectively, were detected and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy 
he Pph protein expressed in R. centenaria is found in a complex with Rc-CheW  To test whether the Pph protein also assembles into a complex in R. centenaria cells, a plasmid containing an oxygen regulated puc promoter and an N-terminally histagged and C-terminally strep-tagged histidine kinase domain gene was constructed 
his plasmid was transferred from E. coli RR28 [38] to R. centenaria by conjugation and the protein expression was induced by anaerobic growth conditions (see Experimental Procedures) 
he culture was continued at 42°C for 96 h and the Pph protein was purified using streptactin sepharose 
n contrast, two bands corresponding to a molecular weight of about 85 kDa and 60 kDa, respectively, were found 
he 85 kDa band was also recognized by the antibody to Rc-CheW (Figure 8C), suggesting that this band contains a Pph dimer and RcCheW protein 
n conclusion, a stable complex of Pph and CheW can be isolated from R. centenaria cells confirming our in vitro findings.  Discussion Since photosynthetic bacteria have to locate their habitat with optimal light conditions, specialized sensor systems and signal transduction cascades involving different chromophores arose during evolution (for review see [39])

he phytochromes TaxD1, Cph2 and PlpA were found to be involved in the phototactic reaction of Synechocystis sp 
he interaction of Pph and Rc-CheW was also observed in vitro with purified components showing a strong affinity with a KD of about 130 nM (Figure 5) 
n contrast to the trimeric Tsr-CheA-CheW complex that is formed in E. coli with an affinity of about 3 μM [16] we observed that the complex formation of Pph and RcCheW is clearly ATP-dependent (Figure 4B)

he heterologous expression of Pph has a strong inhibitory effect on chemotaxis as demonstrated by the swarm assay (Figure 2) and the capillary assay (Figure 3) 
his suggests that the Ppr protein interacts with Ec-CheW although the CheW proteins of E. coli and R. centenaria show a homology of only about 59% and an identity of 28% [12] 
e propose that the binding of the Ppr protein results in a nonfunctional Ec-CheW-Ppr complex that is inhibitory for chemotaxis (Figures 2 and 3) due to the inactivation of Ec-CheW 
e found that the histidine kinase domain Pph was mainly present as a monomer when expressed in E. coli (Figure 7) and only a minor fraction was found as dimers 
ccordingly, when the plasmid encoded Pph protein was isolated from R. centenaria it appeared in a complex consisting of CheW and most likely a dimer of Pph (Figure 8).  Conclusions Working in a network together with the perception of chemical substrates by the chemotactic signal transduction cascade, Ppr could very well be a part of a complex sensory machinery to tune metabolic and phototrophic processes in phototrophic bacteria 
herefore, Ppr could work in parallel with the photosynthetic electron transport sensor Ptr of R. centenaria [50] to specifically regulate cellular motility and sense the metabolic state of the cell

he chemotactic assays were performed as follows. 300 μl of the cell suspension were filled in each drilling of the chamber and a capillary containing either 2 μl 1 mM aspartate or 2 μl H 2 O as a control was placed into the channel between the two cylindrical compartments 
he outside of the capillary was washed extensively with sterile water and the content of the capillary was blown out and a dilution series was streaked on agar plates 
fter overnight incubation at 37°C the colonies were counted and the chemotactic inhibition (CI) was calculated as the ratio of colonies of the water containing capillary to the colonies from the aspartate containing capillary

MC Microbiology 2010, 10:281 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/281  RESEARCH ARTICLE  Open Access  The photosensor protein Ppr of Rhodocista centenaria is linked to the chemotaxis signalling pathway Sven Kreutel, Andreas Kuhn*, Dorothee Kiefer  Abstract Background: Rhodocista centenaria is a phototrophic a-proteobacterium exhibiting a phototactic behaviour visible as colony movement on agar plates directed to red light 
atrix-assisted coelution experiments were performed to study the possible communication of the different putative binding partners 
he kinase domain of the Ppr protein was found to interact with the chemotactic linker protein CheW 
n addition, when Ppr or Pph were expressed in Escherichia coli, the chemotactic response of the cells was dramatically affected 
onclusions: The Ppr protein of Rhodocista centenaria directly interacts with the chemotactic protein CheW 
his suggests a role of the Ppr protein in the regulation of the chemotactic response in addition to its role in chalcone synthesis.  Background Rhodocista centenaria, first described as Rhodospirillum centenum [1] is a thermotolerant phototrophic purple bacterium of the a-proteobacteria group isolated from hot springs in Wyoming 1985 
owever, 16S rRNA analysis elucidated considerable differences between the species, hence Rhodocista was separated into a new genus [3], now consisting of three species [4,5] 
. centenaria is closely related to the plant-associated genus Azospirillum [6] 
n brief, the histidine kinase CheA is linked to the chemotactic receptors (MCPs) by the CheW protein [16] 
his trimeric receptor complex controls the phosphorylation level of the response regulator CheY 
ctivated CheY (CheY-P) interacts directly with the motor of the flagella to control swimming direction 
he dephosphorylation of CheY-P occurs spontaneously, only in enterobacteria this reaction is accelerated by the phosphatase CheZ 
hile Che proteins are generally involved in chemotactic responses, they were also shown to affect the phototactic response in R. centenaria as demonstrated by the analysis of many che mutants [19] 
lthough there is no obvious direct involvement of Ppr in the phototactic or scotophobic reaction, an interaction with the chemotactic signal transduction components is plausible to regulate general phosphorylation levels or transduce phosphoryl groups to a yet unknown light-dependent signal transducing protein 
hen high amounts of single proteins of the chemotactic network are expressed a non-responding chemotactic phenotype is observed, similar to a che deletion mutant [28] 
o investigate whether the Ppr protein of R. centenaria participates in the chemotactic network, Ppr and, in particular, its histidine kinase domain Pph were overexpressed in the chemotactic wild-type strain E. coli MM500 
hese plasmids carry the cloned genes under the control of the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter 
ll three Ppr-derived proteins were expressed in the presence of arabinose (Figure 2A, even numbered lanes) but not in the presence of fructose (odd numbered lanes) 
ext, the chemotactic behaviour of the transformed cells was assayed 
he response was completely abolished when cells containing the plasmids pBAD-Ppr or pBAD-Pph were grown in the presence of arabinose 
owever, the expression of the mutant protein Pph-H670A where the histidine residue at position 670 has been substituted with an alanine residue, led to an only intermediate chemotactic response (upper right panel) 
s a control, the histidine kinase KdpE from R. centenaria was overexpressed which did not interfere with the chemotactic swarming (lower right panel) 
o rule out that the inhibitory effect  Kreutel et al

he truncated Pph protein consists of the histidine kinase domain (residues 602-884) 
o differences in growth rates depending on the presence of arabinose or fructose in the media were found (data not shown) 
o investigate the inhibitory effect of the Ppr protein on chemotaxis in more detail capillary assays with a chemotactic chamber [30] were performed 
he number of cells entering a capillary containing the attractant aspartate (1 mM) was determined after 30 min of incubation 
o normalize the chemotactic activity the chemotactic inhibition (CI) was evaluated by dividing the colony forming units in the control samples (cfu H2O) by the colony forming units in the experiment onset (cfu Asp) 
onsequently, a high CI value indicates that the chemotactic response is blocked whereas a low CI value reflects a normal chemotaxis 
n contrast, cells grown with 0.2% fructose (hatched columns) or cells harbouring the pBAD vector (left columns), showed a CI of approximately 0.35 
o check whether the inhibitory effect depends on the amount of Pph protein, capillary chemotaxis assays with different induction times were performed (Figure 3B) 
t the respective time, the expression of Pph was analysed by SDS-PAGE (inlet) 
aken together, the results strongly indicate that the Pph interferes with the chemotactic pathway in E. coli 
o avoid unspecific binding of Pph to the Cu Sepharose, a buffer containing 50 mM imidazole was used 
he positions of molecular weight markers are indicated. (B) TB swarm agar plates containing either 0.2% arabinose or 0.2% fructose as indicated were inoculated with the following cells 
o develop chemotactic rings the plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37°C.  Kreutel et al

(A) The chemotactic response to aspartate of E. coli MM500 cells expressing the various Pph-derived proteins was investigated with a chemotactic chamber 
he chemotactic inhibition rate was calculated after induction either with fructose (hatched columns) or arabinose (white columns) for the indicated time points 
he error bars indicate the standard deviations of three independent experiments 
he odd numbered lanes are the non-induced controls.  Kreutel et al 
s shown in Figure 4A, the Pph protein co-elutes in the elution fractions containing Rc-CheW (lane 6) whereas no Pph protein was detected in the elution fraction of the control without Rc-CheW (lane 3) 
he co-elution rate was calculated to 13% of the input Pph protein (lane 4) 
o address the possible role of ATP in the binding process of the histidine kinase domain to Rc-CheW, co-elution experiments in the presence of increasing amounts of added ATP (0-20 mM) were performed 
he data clearly show that the stepwise addition of ATP increased the amount of the Rc-CheW-bound Pph up to 24% (Figure 4B) 
hen, for a control, the residual ATP was hydrolyzed by adding apyrase, the binding decreased to 5% 
his explains why in the experiment with apyrase a lower binding was observed than when no additional ATP was added 
he purified Pph protein was then bound via its strep-tag to the immobilized streptactin

o investigate whether the Pph protein can form a dimer in vitro, we performed gel filtration under non-reducing conditions 
he molecular weight of the Pph protein complexes was estimated by comparison with standard proteins on the same column

o verify the oligomeric states, fractions 43-46 were run on a nonreducing SDS-PAGE 
he analysis clearly identified the Ppr photoreceptor (data not shown) 
t the expected molecular weight of about 35 kDa no monomeric Pph protein was detectable (Figure 8A) 
he 85 kDa band was recognized by an antibody to the strep-tag epitope (Figure 8B), that is present at the C-terminus of Pph 
he 60 kDa band represents a non-identified protein that bound to the immobilized Pph 
he identity was 27% whereas the similarity was calculated with about 57% 
he alignment was performed with the Clustal X software. (B) Purified Pph was analysed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 column 
he Pph protein was detected with a conjugate raised against the C-terminal StrepTag II 
he position of the Pph protein is indicated 
he structural organization suggests that the protein is involved in a light-dependent signaling pathway similar to chemotaxis 
ince R. centenaria exhibits a strikingly obvious phototactic behavior it is compelling to assume that the Ppr protein is involved in this reaction 
CC 6803, a finding that supports the  idea of a participation of the Ppr sensor in the phototactic response of R. centenaria [42,43] 
he data presented here show that the histidine kinase Pph domain of the Ppr receptor is found in a complex with Rc-CheW when isolated from R. centenaria (Figure 8) 
t is likely that the Pph-CheW complex is capable to bind RcCheAY (Figure 6) consistent with the idea that the chemotactic network is functioning in the presence of Pph 
owever, the function of the Rc-CheAY fusion protein in this signaling cascade remains unclear 
he involvement of Ppr in chemotaxis is also supported from the experiments we  Page 10 of 15  performed with E. coli 
oth assays showed that upon expression of Ppr or Pph the chemotaxis of E. coli is turned off whereas expression of the R. centenaria histidine kinase KdpE had no effect 
owever, the structural analysis suggests that all CheW proteins of different species share common features [46,47] 
emarkedly, a mutant of the predicted phosphorylation site of Pph with the histidine at position 670 being changed to an alanine residue had a less inhibitory effect on chemotaxis, suggesting that the kinase activity of Pph has a functional role in CheW binding 
imilar inhibitory effects on chemotaxis have been observed for E. coli when Ec-CheW, Ec-CheA or the MCP-receptors were overproduced [23,25,27] 
he perception of light may only be an oblique indicator for the metabolic state of a R. centenaria cell as is suggested by its influence on cyst formation [13,22] 
he gene fragment coding for the histidine kinase domain Pph was amplified by PCR using the cloned ppr gene in pT-Adv as a template (Clontech) 
imultaneously, a SnaBI restriction site was introduced at the 3’ end of the gene 
his plasmid was used as a template to insert the puc promoter via a second PCR 
fter sequencing, the pph construct was excised by  Kreutel et al 
or the kinetic analysis the incubation times are indicated in Figure 3B 
hen the cells were harvested by centrifugation 
fter washing the column with five column volumes buffer W + 0.01% N-lauroylsarcosine, the protein was eluted with buffer W + 0.01% N-lauroylsarcosine containing 2.5 mM desthiobiotin 
he homogeneity of the protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE.  Kreutel et al 
he resulting Scatchard Plot is illustrated as the inlet of Figure 5 
his procedure prevents the formation of inclusion bodies [36]

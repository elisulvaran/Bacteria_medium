TY medium was prepared by addition of 0 05 % yeast extract and removal of sodium hydrogen carbonate from Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by IP 189.155.188.202 On Thu 15 Feb 2018 23:53:23 Printed in Great Britain 1111 D 
 hiamin and vitamin B12 but not biotin were required for growth and 0 05 % yeast extract stimulated growth 
 fter 1 week cultivation the pink-reddish colonies were picked and streaked onto agar plates 
 ells grown under illumination were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 60 % sucrose solution 
 he absorption spectrum was recorded with spectrophotometers HP1050 Hewlett Packard for 300–820 nm and Hitachi model 557 for 800–1200 nm 
 bsorbance maxima of phototrophically grown cells were 378 516 548 594 798 and 885 nm which is indicative of the presence of bacteriochlorophyll a and pigments of the spirilloxanthin series

 NA G+C content DNA–DNA hybridization and phylogenetic relationships The G+C content of the genomic DNA for strain 3-pT was 68 8 mol % 
 hiamin and vitamin B12 are required for growth and 0 05 % yeast extract stimulates growth 
 train 3-pT was iso- lated from the Gao-Bei-Dian municipal wastewater treatment plant in Beijing which is the main facility for the treatment of sewage from Beijing a city with more than 10 million inhabitants 
 gar plates were prepared by addition of 1 5 % agar to the medium 
 oft agar was made by reducing the amount of agar to 0 7 % 
 mong the phototrophic bacteria strain 3-pT was most closely related to Rhodocista centenaria 97 % similarity 
 train 3-pT showed 56 % DNA–DNA hybridization to Rhodocista centenaria which is lower than 70 % a level generally accepted to distinguish species 
 NA G+C content is 68 8 mol % 
 o growth was observed in medium with 3 % NaCl 
 he DNA G+C content of cells was 68 8 mol % 
 he pH range for growth was 6 5–8 0 with an optimum of 7 0

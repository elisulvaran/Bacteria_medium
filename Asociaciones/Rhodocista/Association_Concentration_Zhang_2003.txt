 hiamin and vitamin B12, but not biotin, were required for growth and 0?05 % yeast extract stimulated growth 
 fter 1 week cultivation, the pink-reddish colonies were picked and streaked onto agar plates 
 ells grown under illumination were  harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 60 % sucrose solution 
 he absorption spectrum was recorded with spectrophotometers HP1050 (Hewlett Packard) for 300–820 nm, and Hitachi model 557 for 800–1200 nm 
 hiamin and vitamin B12 are required for growth and 0?05 % yeast extract stimulates growth 
 train 3-pT was iso-  lated from the Gao-Bei-Dian municipal wastewater treatment plant in Beijing, which is the main facility for the treatment of sewage from Beijing (a city with more than 10 million inhabitants) 
 gar plates were prepared by addition of 1?5 % agar to the medium 
 oft agar was made by reducing the amount of agar to 0?7 % 
 mong the phototrophic bacteria, strain 3-pT was most closely related to Rhodocista centenaria (97 % similarity) 
 train 3-pT showed 56 % DNA–DNA hybridization to Rhodocista centenaria, which is lower than 70 %, a level generally accepted to distinguish species 
 o growth was observed in medium with 3 % NaCl 
 he pH range for growth was 6?5–8?0, with an optimum of 7?0

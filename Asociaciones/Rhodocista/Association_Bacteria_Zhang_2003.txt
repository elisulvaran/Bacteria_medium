hina  Correspondence Shuang-Jiang Liu shuangjiang@hotmail.com  A novel bacterial species, Rhodocista pekingensis sp. nov., was isolated from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and characterized by polyphasic taxonomy 
he type strain of Rhodocista pekingensis is 3-pT (=AS 1.2194T=JCM 11669T).  INTRODUCTION Many phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria show two modes of growth: either anaerobic phototrophy under light conditions or aerobic chemotrophy in the dark (Imhoff & Trüper, 1989) 
piral-shaped phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria were included in the genus Rhodospirillum (Trüper & Imhoff, 1989) before the proposal of the species Rhodocista centenaria (Kawasaki et al., 1992) and Rhodospira trueperi (Pfennig et al., 1997) 
he establishment of the genus Rhodocista was based mainly on the results of 16S rDNA sequences and also on its unique cyst-producing morphology and cellular quinone (Q-9) 
ntil now, R. centenaria has been the only species of the genus Rhodocista and the type strain, ATCC 43720T, was isolated from hot springs in Wyoming, USA (Favinger et al., 1989) 
hylogenetic and phenotypic characterization of this isolate indicated that it is a novel species of the genus Rhodocista, for which the name Rhodocista pekingensis is proposed.  METHODS Bacterial strains, media and cultivation

nlike Rhodocista centenaria, no R-body was observed in cells of strain 3-pT 
hen cultivated anaerobically in the light, strain 3-pT grew at 25–44 uC, with an optimum between 31 and 42 uC; this strain differs from Rhodocista centenaria in that the latter has an optimal growth temperature of 39–45 uC 
ifferential characteristics of strain 3-pT and Rhodocista centenaria ATCC 43720T +, Good growth/positive; 2, no growth/negative; ND, not done 
ata for Rhodocista centenaria were obtained from Favinger et al. (1989), Stadtwald-Demchick et al. (1990) and Kawasaki et al. (1992) 
oth strain 3-pT and Rhodocista centenaria ATCC 43720T are vibrioid to spiral in shape, positive for cyst production, have Q-9 as the major quinone, require cobalamin (vitamin B12) for growth, grow on acetate, lactate, pyruvate and butyrate, and do not grow on malate or tartrate

mong the phototrophic bacteria, strain 3-pT was most closely related to Rhodocista centenaria (97 % similarity) 
train 3-pT formed a close cluster with the only species of the genus Rhodocista (Rhodocista centenaria) and two species of the genus Azospirillum (Azospirillum irakense and Azospirillum amazonense).  The phenotypic differences between strain 3-pT and Rhodocista centenaria are listed in Table 1 
riefly, strain 3-pT assimilated succinate, needed thiamin for growth, had an optimal growth temperature between 31 and 42 uC and no R-bodies were seen in cells, whereas Rhodocista centenaria did not assimilate succinate, needed biotin rather than thiamin for growth, had an optimal growth temperature of 39–45 uC and R-bodies did occur in cells 
train 3-pT showed 56 % DNA–DNA hybridization to Rhodocista centenaria, which is lower than 70 %, a level generally accepted to distinguish species

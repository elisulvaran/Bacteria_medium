RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The 16S rRNA sequences of `` Rhodospirillum centenum '' IAM 14193T two phototrophic isolates MT-SP-2 and MT-SP-3 Rhodopseudomonas palustris ATCC 17001T and Erythrobacter longus JCM 6170T were determined 
hese sequences were comprised of about 1,300 bases ranging between the positions 2 and 1,380 E. coli numbering system together with the reference sequences of Rhodospirillum rubrum ATH 1.1.1T EMBL accession number M32020 and Escherichia coli 1 2 30

hese regions were excluded because the variations among the sequences were so large due to the many deletions and insertions that exact alignment could not be expected and because the inclusion of too variable regions in the phylogenetic analysis would give unreliable relationships at higher taxonomic ranks 
phylogenetic tree reconstructed by applying the neighbor-joining method is shown in Fig . 1 . `` Rhodospirillum centenum '' JAM 14193Tand the two phototropic isolates exhibited high levels of sequence relatedness 98.8 % homology , and the two isolates were completely homologous Table 1

he homology values of 87.6 to 89.9 % between each of the three cyst-forming bacteria and the other members of a Proteobacteria were within this range 
owever the cyst-formers constituted a rather deep branch that was distinct from any other lineages and could not be assigned to any of subgroups of the Proteobacteria a group 
he quinone systems of the species of the genus Rhodospirillum are compared in Table 2 . `` Rhodospirillum centenum '' JAM 14193Thad Q-9 but no rhodoquinones or menaquinones and its quinone system was different from that of the other species 6 7,10,11 
he organism can be clearly differentiated chemotaxonomically from other members of Rhodospirillaceae by the combination of quinone system and G + C content of the DNA 
he two cyst-forming isolates were confirmed to share the following characters with `` Rhodospirillum centenum '' JAM 14193T cyst formation vibrioid to spiral cell shape bacteriochlorophill a lamellae membrane system Q-9 and G + C content of DNA 69.2 and 69.8 mol % for MT-SP-2 and MT-SP-3 respectively 
n the bases of phylogenetic relatedness and phenotypic characteristics the two isolates are considered to belong to the same taxon of `` Rhodospirillum centenum '' JAM 14193T at least at the generic level . `` Rhodospirillum centenum '' JAM 14193Thas a morphologically unique characteristic that the cells of the strain form cysts when grown under aerobic conditions in the dark

he distinctness in phylogenetic relationships and chemotaxonomic and morphological characteristics shown above supports an idea that `` Rhodospirillum centenum '' JAM 14193T should be placed in a genus apart from the genus Rhodospirillum . `` Rhodospirillum centenum '' was described and effectively published by Favinger et al . in 1989 4 
he term `` centenum '' means `` a hundred '' in Latin and was used as a specific epithet to commemorate `` a century '' that had passed since 1887 when the first description of a phototrophic bacterium was published by Esmarch 3 
owever it has not been validated and has no standing in bacterial nomenclature 
herefore we propose the establishment of a new genus and a new species Rhodocista centenaria for `` Rhodospirillum centenum '' IAM 14193T

aterials and Methods Isolation and characterization of T4 Phototrophic bacteria were enriched from a waste water pond [depth 1.5 m, pH 7.6 ð 0.4, 28 ∞C, organic load (1200 ð 600) mg/l BOD (biological oxygen demand), 3Ð6 mg/l sulfide] in Laphu, Hoaiduc, HaTay province (Vietnam) by anaerobic growth in light in screw cap tubes or bottles filled with a medium containig (g/l): KH2PO4 (1.0); MgCl2 · 6H2O (0.5); CaCl2 · 2H2O (0.1); NH4Cl (1); NaCl (1); NaHCO3 (1); Na-acetate (3); 1 ml vitamin solution; 1 ml trace element solution (Trüper and Imhoff, 1989); at pH 6.8Ð7.2 
omparative physiological characterization of Rhodocista centenaria, R. pekingensis and T4 Growth tests with different C (36.5 mm) or N (18 mm) sources (see Table I) were carried out at 30 ∞C in liquid cultures under aerobic heterotrophic (5 ml on a rotary shaker) or anaerobic phototrophic conditions (8 ml screw cap bottles without gas phase, illumination by a tungsten lamp) with the medium as described above, omitting NH4Cl when testing N sources, and omitting acetate when testing C sources 
yst formation of T4 Cyst formation was induced as described by Berleman and Bauer (2004), by aerobic mainte-  nance for several days at 42 ∞C on plates containing NH4Cl and butyrate as N and C sources, respectively 
omparative studies of Rhodocista strains Survival at non-growing conditions In a comparative set of experiments the three strains were plated on agar plates containing NH4Cl and butyrate, and incubated at 42 ∞C for 4 months, so that the plates dried completely

aturforsch. 62 c, 571Ð575 (2007); received August 25, 2006/February 1, 2007 A new purple bacterium (strain T4), capable of heterotrophic aerobic and phototrophic anaerobic growth, was isolated from waste water of a noodle factory near Hanoi, Vietnam 
omparative studies of T4 with Rhodocista centenaria (Rhodospirillum centenum) and Rhodocista pekingensis revealed a remarkable physiological versatility regarding nutrient spectra and survival properties of this genus 
he spiral-shaped strains among them were formerly collected in the genus Rhodospirillum (Trüper and Imhoff, 1989) 
hen, however, more isolates of this group had been analyzed biochemically and genetically Ð especially by sequencing of 16S rDNA Ð it became evident, that description of the genus Rhodospirillum had to be revised: new genera like Rhodospira (Pfennig et al., 1997) or Rhodocista (Kawasaki et al., 1992) were established 
o far two Rhodocista sp. have been described: R. centenaria and R. pekingensis (Zhang et al., 2003) 
ased on the use of 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes (Stoffels et al., 2001) and the 16S rDNA sequences a distance matrix tree shows close phylogenetic relationships of Rhodocista with Azospirillum (see Fig. 1 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/treeview/blast_ tree_view.cgi?request=page&rid=1155726842Ð 25814Ð85101723765.BLASTQ4&dbname=nr& queryID=lcl|1_25814&distmode=on&screen Width=1024). 0939Ð5075/2007/0700Ð0571 $ 06.00  We here report: (i) isolation and characterization of a novel bacterium of the Rhodocista group (strain T4), which differs considerably from the species mentioned above, and therefore is proposed to form a novel species, tentatively named Rhodocista hanoiensis, and (ii) extensive comparative studies which document the interesting versatility and adaptability of the members of the genus Rhodocista

Purity of strains was also demonstrated by uniformity of growth on plates and of morphology of cells after growth on selective media (see below) 
xpression of pigments as function of oxygen content in the gas phase was assessed by incubation under 0, 2.5, 5, 8, 10, 15 and 20% O2 in the light 
NA was isolated and purified according to standard techniques (Sambrook et al., 1989) 
 fragment of 16S rDNA was amplified and sequenced using standard primers described by Wittke et al. (1997) 
he sequence was deposited in the EMBL gene bank and received the accession number AJ580798

ther properties of strain T4 Vegetative cells of T4 had a vibroid to rod shape with dimensions of (0.7 ¥ 2) μm under aerobic (Fig. 2a) and (0.7 ¥ 4) μm under anaerobic growth conditions (Fig. 2b) 
n vivo absorption spectra of anaerobically cultivated cells showed maxima at 410, 480, 510, 590, 800 and 875 nm, indicative of the presence of bacteriochlorophyll a and spirilloxanthin-like pigments 
heir development closely followed the pattern as cited above: after 1 d some cells began to swell (Fig. 2c) and finally formed tetrads like R. centenaria (Figs. 2d, e)

icroscopic inspections showed that cultures were pure and showed the typical characteristics of the original strains 
tilization of C and N sources The spectrum of C and N sources for the Rhodocista strains, especially T4 is rather wide (Table I): apart from many mono- and dicarboxylic acids, the organisms can use a number of carbohydrates and benzoate as C and most amino acids as N sources 
iscussion The 16S rDNA sequence data as well as the physiological characteristics and ability of cyst formation demonstrate, that T4 is a novel species belonging to the genus Rhodocista 
he physiological comparison reveals a remarkable versatility as to C and N source utilization of this genus 
hodocista species are methylotrophs, being able to aerobically use methanol, formiate and methylamine as C sources

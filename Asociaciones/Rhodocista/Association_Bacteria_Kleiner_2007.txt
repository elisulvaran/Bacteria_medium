 comparison of 16S rDNA sequences revealed its association with the genus Rhodocista 
omparative studies of T4 with Rhodocista centenaria (Rhodospirillum centenum) and Rhodocista pekingensis revealed a remarkable physiological versatility regarding nutrient spectra and survival properties of this genus 
ey words: Rhodocista hanoiensis, Cyst Formation, 16S rDNA  Introduction Phototrophic proteobacteria are distinguished by their ability to carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis 
hen, however, more isolates of this group had been analyzed biochemically and genetically Ð especially by sequencing of 16S rDNA Ð it became evident, that description of the genus Rhodospirillum had to be revised: new genera like Rhodospira (Pfennig et al., 1997) or Rhodocista (Kawasaki et al., 1992) were established 
he first Rhodocista species, R. centenaria, had originally been described as Rhodospirillum centenum (Favinger et al., 1989) 
o far two Rhodocista sp. have been described: R. centenaria and R. pekingensis (Zhang et al., 2003) 
ased on the use of 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes (Stoffels et al., 2001) and the 16S rDNA sequences a distance matrix tree shows close phylogenetic relationships of Rhodocista with Azospirillum (see Fig. 1 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/treeview/blast_ tree_view.cgi?request=page&rid=1155726842Ð 25814Ð85101723765.BLASTQ4&dbname=nr& queryID=lcl|1_25814&distmode=on&screen Width=1024). 0939Ð5075/2007/0700Ð0571 $ 06.00  We here report: (i) isolation and characterization of a novel bacterium of the Rhodocista group (strain T4), which differs considerably from the species mentioned above, and therefore is proposed to form a novel species, tentatively named Rhodocista hanoiensis, and (ii) extensive comparative studies which document the interesting versatility and adaptability of the members of the genus Rhodocista

Purity of strains was also demonstrated by uniformity of growth on plates and of morphology of cells after growth on selective media (see below) 
omparative physiological characterization of Rhodocista centenaria, R. pekingensis and T4 Growth tests with different C (36.5 mm) or N (18 mm) sources (see Table I) were carried out at 30 ∞C in liquid cultures under aerobic heterotrophic (5 ml on a rotary shaker) or anaerobic phototrophic conditions (8 ml screw cap bottles without gas phase, illumination by a tungsten lamp) with the medium as described above, omitting NH4Cl when testing N sources, and omitting acetate when testing C sources

tilization of C and N sources The spectrum of C and N sources for the Rhodocista strains, especially T4 is rather wide (Table I): apart from many mono- and dicarboxylic acids, the organisms can use a number of carbohydrates and benzoate as C and most amino acids as N sources 
iscussion The 16S rDNA sequence data as well as the physiological characteristics and ability of cyst formation demonstrate, that T4 is a novel species belonging to the genus Rhodocista

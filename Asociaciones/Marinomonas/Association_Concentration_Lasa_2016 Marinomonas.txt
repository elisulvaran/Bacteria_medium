 International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 2016 66 3183â€“3188 DOI 10.1099/ijsem.0.001170 Marinomonas gallaica sp . nov. and Marinomonas atlantica sp . nov. , isolated from reared clams Ruditapes decussatus guez1 and JesÃºs L 
 NAâ€“DNA hybridizations were performed to confirm the taxonomic position and the results were below the recommended threshold for species delimitation specifically 44.5 % Cmf 17.2T with M. aquimarina CECT 5080T and 55 % Cmf 18.22Twith M. aquimarina CECT 5080T 
 he estimated G+C content of the genomic DNA was found to be 45.3 % Cmf 17.2T and 44.6 % Cmf 18.22T 
 nalysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the three strains belonged to the genus Marinomonas showing the highest sequence similarity with the type strains of M. aquimarina 97.8 % â€“98.5 % , Marinomonas ostreistagni 97.3 % â€“97.4 % , Marinomonas fungiae 97.2 % â€“97.3 % , and Marinomonas brasilensis 97.1 % â€“97.2 % 
 imilarity between strains Cmf 17.2T and Rd 20.33 was 99.5 % and between Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T was 97.9 % 
 ccording to the LTP database sequence similarities ranging between 94.5 % and 98.7 % suggest that the microbial strain can be classified as a member of a given genus whereas higher similarities would be indicative of belonging to a given species Yarza et al. 2008 
 he DNA G+C content was estimated according to the draft genome of strains Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T and was found to be 45.3 % and 44.6 % respectively which are in the range of the genus i.e. 41â€“50 % ( Espinosa et al. 2010 
 he values obtained using these indexes Table 1 were below the respective thresholds 95â€“ 96 % ANI and 70 % eDDH indicating that these strains represent two novel species of the genus 
 dditionally OrthoANI Lee et al. 2015 values showed similarities of 76.26 % between M. aquimarina CECT 5080T and Cmf 17.2T 76.01 % between M. aquimarina CECT 5080T and Cmf 18.22T and 90.75 % between strains Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T 
 esults obtained from DDH experiments between Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T with M. aquimarina CECT 5080T confirmed their separate status at the species level since the reassociation values were always below the recommended threshold 44.5 % reassociation value for Cmf 17.2T with M. aquimarina CECT 5080T and 55 % reassociation value for Cmf 18.22T with M. aquimarina CECT 5080T 
 he reassociation value between strains Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T was 45.5 % . High Pure PCR Template Preparation kit Roche was employed for isolation of genomic DNA for whole-genome sequencing and DNAâ€“DNA hybridization DDH experiments

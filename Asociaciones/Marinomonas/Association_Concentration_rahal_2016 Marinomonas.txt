 ll strains were positive for growth at 15â€“26  C with sodium plus magnesium plus calcium ions at 2â€“6 % salinity and with yeast extract on Basal Medium Agar 
 nalysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence retrieved from the whole-genome sequence showed that this bacterium was most closely related to Marinomonas dokdonensis and other Marinomonas species 96.3 and 93.3â€“95.7 % sequence similarities respectively , within the family Oceanospirillaceae 
 ts genome had an approximate length of 5.1 million bases and a DNA G+C content equal to 40.9 mol % 
 n Blanes Bay north-western Mediterranean Sea Gammaproteobacteria account for up to 8 % and occasionally 50 % of the total bacterial community as shown by catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization Alonso-Saez et al. 2007 
 ED121T was subsequently selected for complete sequencing of its genome as part of a survey of phylogenetically and phenotypically Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by 001554 Ã£ 2016 IUMS Printed in Great Britain IP 189.155.188.202 On Sat 17 Feb 2018 09:09:11 Marinomonas blandensis sp . nov. water was spread onto ZoBell agar plates prepared from seawater from the Bay of Blanes indicating an abundance of approximately 1103 c.f.u . ml 1 
 fter primary isolation and purification strain MED121T was cultivated at room temperature on the same medium and stored at 80  C in ZoBell â€™ s medium with 25 % v/v glycerol . distinct bacteria thriving in the marine environment 
 he sample was enriched with 0.6 ÂµM P final concentration added as ATP , and was incubated for 72 h at 15  C in the dark 
 he highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to strain MED121T corresponded to Marinomonas dokdonensis DSW10-10T Marinomonas brasilensis R-40503T and Marinomonas posidonica IVIA-Po-181T with 96.3 95.7 and 95.6 % pairwise similarity respectively

 he salinity range supporting growth on diluted Marine Agar or in Marine Agar supplemented with NaCl as reported in Macian et al . 2005 was between 2.5 and 7 % w/v total salts 
 t resulted in an annotated genome size of approximately 5.15 Mbp 4696 putative ORF with a G+C content of 40.9 mol % which is very close to the lower limit of the range given in the emended description of the genus 41â€“50 mol % Espinosa et al. 2010

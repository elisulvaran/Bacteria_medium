hylogenetic analysis of characterized GH42 BGAs also revealed that MaBGA had closer genetic relationships with thermophilic BGAs derived from extremophiles including thermophiles 11–15 and halophiles 16,17 
n account of the enzymatic and phylogenetic analyses MaBGA was considered as a thermophilic enzyme although the thermal stability of MaBGA is weaker than those of its thermophilic counterparts 
dditionally MaBGA only shared high identity > 70 % with BGAs of the genus Marinomonas and no sequence with identity more than 55 % was found in their related marine species 
n the basis of the above evidence a putative explanation was proposed to illustrate the mismatch of enzyme stability and circumstance 
s indicated above MaBGA was able to hydrolyze Galβ1–3GlcNAc but was unable to hydrolyze Galβ1–4GlcNAc and Galβ1–6GlcNAc 
hus the three-dimensional structure of MaBGA was constructed and subject to docking analysis after energy minimization by molecular dynamics 
s shown in Figure 7c for all these three substrates although the galactosyl group adopts similar lowest energy conformations the distance is a bit long for the reaction between the oxygen atom linking the acetylglucosamine group and the carboxyl group of catalytic residues Glu142/Glu314 
owever the planar representation of the interaction of the enzyme/substrate complex indicated that the strong interaction between the glucosyl group of Galβ1–4GlcNAc Figure 7e /Galβ1–6GlcNAc Figure 7f and the enzyme might lead to the failure of the substrates to adjust their conformation for an optimal fit 
owever due to the different binding energy between the glucosyl group and enzyme Galβ1–4GlcNAc and Galβ1–6GlcNAc can not readily overcome the energy barrier other than Galβ1–3GlcNAc 
n general further experiments such as enzyme/substrate complex co-crystallization and site-directed mutagenesis are still needed to test the hypothesis 
previous study had proven that galacto-oligosaccharides with β1–3 linkage have a stronger bifidogenic effect than those with β1–4 and β1–6 linkages 35 , indicating that the former would be more popular as prebiotics than the latter two

iscussion In the present study a thermostable β-1,3-galactosidase MaBGA was successfully purified to homogeneity from Marinomonas sp 
he purification results showed that the two-step purification method is efficient for separating MaBGA from the wild-type strain of Marinomonas sp 
Si20414 which also provides a reference for extracting other proteins from strains belonging to the genus of Marinomonas 
nterestingly as an enzyme stemmed from a strain living in permanently low-temperature marine environments MaBGA displayed extraordinary stability against heat with the half-life determined as 16 h at 50 ◦ C 
t is supposed that the ancestor of the genus Marinomonas acquired the gene encoding thermophilic β-galactosidase from other thermophiles by occasional horizontal transfer then experienced adaptive evolution under low-temperature marine environments for a long period which led to a decrease in thermal stability without selection pressures 
urthermore it displayed not only group selectivity but also linkage selectivity in the substrate recognition process 
o better understand the linkage selectivity of MaBGA it is essential to put MaBGA against its structural contexts 
herefore the substrate molecule needs to fine-tune its geometry to shorten the distance mentioned above by overcoming the energy barrier 
herefore we proposed that the favored binding conformation with lowest free binding energy of the substrate is not close enough to the catalytic residues to let the reaction occur thus the substrate might be fine-tuning its conformation to achieve an optimal geometry for the reaction 
enerally the production of galacto-oligosaccharides is implemented by the transglycosylation activity of β-galactosidase 36 therefore , the linkage of galacto-oligosaccharides will depend on the linkage recognition ability of β-galactosidase 
ince β-galactosidases that existed in the nature which are capable of recognizing β1–3 galactoside linkage are very few the β-1,3-galactosidase MaBGA studied in the present work not only could provide a promising candidate for the biosynthesis of galacto-oligosaccharides with β1–3 linkage but also would offer a good model for research on the substrate recognition mechanism of β-galactosidase .

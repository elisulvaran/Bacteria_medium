 esmos and Pacmas are the two fields in the Manus Basin where low pH and high concentrations of H2S and SO42- were detected 37 
 he concentration of DNA samples were diluted to 1 ng/μL using sterile water after measured by a spectrophotometer and their purity were determined by 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis 
 CR was performed in 30 μL volumes containing 15 μL of Phusion1 High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix New England Biolabs 0.2 μmol of forward and reverse primers , and about 10 ng template DNA 
 hermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 98˚C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98˚C for 10 s annealing at 50˚C for 30 s and elongation at 72˚C for 30 s and a final elongation of 5 min at 72˚C

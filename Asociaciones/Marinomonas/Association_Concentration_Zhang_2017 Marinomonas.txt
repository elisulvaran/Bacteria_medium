esmos and Pacmas are the two fields in the Manus Basin, where low pH and high concentrations of H2S and SO42- were detected [37] 
 he concentration of DNA samples were diluted to 1 ng/μL using sterile water after measured by a spectrophotometer and their purity were determined by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis 
 CR was performed in 30 μL volumes containing 15 μL of Phusion1 High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs), 0.2 μmol of forward and reverse primers, and about 10 ng template DNA 
 hermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 98˚C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98˚C for 10 s, annealing at 50˚C for 30 s, and elongation at 72˚C for 30 s, and a final elongation of 5 min at 72˚C

(3.87 in Shannon index).  Composition of microbiota in the gills and intestines from three species of crabs Based on the annotated information of the microbial 16S rDNA data obtained by HTS, 39 different phyla of bacteria were observed in the gills and intestines of three crab species

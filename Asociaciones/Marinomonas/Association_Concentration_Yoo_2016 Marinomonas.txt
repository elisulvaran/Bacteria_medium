 ptimum pH of the purified ProA toward skim milk showed a typical bellshaped curve with the maximum activity at pH 8.0 in 20 mM Tris–HCl buffer 
 ubsequently since no inhibition of the ProA activity with chymostatin even at 0.1 mM was observed these results suggest that cysteine residues may not be possibly involved in the catalytic process of the degradation of outsourcing protein see Table 3 
 mong the metal ions tested Mn2 significantly inhibited about 67 % of enzyme activity whereas the ProA was found to be stable toward most of the metal ions tested compared to the control 
 hese values indicated that ProA has a relatively high affinity toward gelatin for the substrate since it needed a much lower concentration of substrate

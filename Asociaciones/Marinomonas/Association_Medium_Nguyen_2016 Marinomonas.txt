ere each amino acid was modeled by one or two beads according to their specific sizes which has been classified into two broad categories backbone and side chain beads 
he binding site of AFPs has been found to be relatively hydrophobic and also contained many potential hydrogen bond donors/acceptors 
he idea of hydrogen bonds and the hydrophobic effects contribute to ice binding has been under investigation in recent decades 25 26 
he largest AFP experimental structures demonstrated that folds or Ca2+-bound parallel beta-helices with an extensive array of ice-like surface waters were directly anchored via hydrogen bonds to the polypeptide backbone and the adjacent side chains 26 30–36

FPs protect their host by limiting the growth of ice crystal inside and outside body fluids 4 5 
FPs and AFGPs have been found in various Antarctic organism including fish 6–8 plants 9–11 , insects 12–15 , fungi 16 , and bacteria 3 , 17–19 
he antifreeze mechanism of AFPs was determined through microscopic analysis which showed that AFPs bind to ice surface and prevent ice crystallization process 
he difference between AFPs ’ melting point and freezing point is known as thermal hysteresis TH , an important antifreeze indicator of different AFPs 
n addition AFPs at interface between solid ice and liquid water inhibit the thermodynamically favored growth of the ice crystal 
s TH can be measured in laboratory condition with a nanoliter osmometer 21 , TH value of various AFPs was determined such as fish 0.7–1.5 °C , plants 0.2–0.5 °C , insects 3–6 °C , and bacteria less than 0.1 °C [ 22 
acterial AFPs were found to have the lowest TH value and first demonstrated by Duman and Olsen 3 23 
ydrogen bonds were originally proposed to be the major interaction between AFPs and ice crystal 27 
n the other hand recent studies proposed that the hydrophobic effect could have played an important function in the ice inhibition process and provided with evidence that clathrate-like water on the hydrophobic ice-binding site IBS was found to be released into the solvent upon ice binding resulting in a gain in entropy 28 29 
n addition molecular dynamics simulation studies indicated that the relatively hydrophobic IBS of AFPs is capable of reordering water molecules into an ice-like lattice and instead of shedding bound water molecules upon ice binding the reordered water molecules might facilitate the AFP ’ s interaction with ice by matching certain ice geometrical planes 30 
lthough intriguing as it seems these simulations failed to describe the molecular mechanism explaining how an AFP acquires the ability to reorder water molecules in which binding specificity and affinity can assist in the irreversible absorption of AFP into forming ice lattices 
hese problems have been elucidated by the ice-binding mechanisms and the first crystal structure of Antarctic bacterium AFPs 
n recent study Shuaiqi Guo and colleagues found a Ca2+-dependent protein with molecular density of 1.5-MDa has particular ice-binding property called Marinomonas primoryensis antifreeze protein MpAFP 
his protein has five non-ice-binding regions in which on icebinding region II or RII constitutes approximately 90 % of its content and includes around 120 tandem repeats of 104-residue sequence 
hase information of RII crystal structure monomer was determined with a resolution of 1.35 Å by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion and molecular replacement methods with Ca2+ as the heavy atom 
nterestingly the Ca2+ ions are coordinated at the interface between each RII monomer and its symmetry-related molecules suggesting that these ions may involve in the stabilization of RII 
he proposed role of RII is to help the aerobic bacterium bind to surface ice in an Antarctic lake in order to improve oxygen and nutrients accessibility 37 
ince NaCl dissociate the ice crystal by positively charged Na+ ion and negatively charged Cl− ion the NaCl concentration then will keep the water under liquid form when temperature reaches lower than freezing point of °C 
nd NaCl concentration may vary dependent on chronological and geographical condition and distribution 
rom the thermodynamic point of view the increase in NaCl concentration and anti-freezing mechanism of AFPs reduce ice crystallization process respectively as such was found in AFPs 
his leads to the assumption that the change in NaCl concentration may have a certain degree of impact on the behavior and activity of MpAFP 
herefore in order to capture the full picture of MpAFP anti-freezing mechanism our objectives of this study were set to characterize the effects and the inhibiting ability of MpAFP under freezing process in which different marine environments were incorporated by using different NaCl concentrations of 0.3 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l using coarse-grained simulation . Materials and Methods Simulated System Preparation The 3D structure of MpAFP was taken from Protein Data Bank PDB with PDB entry 4KDV 37 
e used Visual Molecular Dynamics VMD software 38 to show the structure of atomistic structure and then MARTINIZE version 2.2 to convert atomistic structure existing in PDB format into coarse-grained beads 39 40 
he periodic boundary conditions were used throughout the simulation process the electrostatic potential was shifted from 0.0 to 1.2 nm and the Lennard Jones LJ potential was shifted from 0.9 to 1.2 nm on all three axes x y and z [ 42 
he complexes were positioned inside a cubic box at a distance of 1.2 nm from the solute to the box surface and water model was used specifically in coarse-grained water model 43 : – The melting point of water models used in MD simulation was not near to real water molecules 44 45 
uch as the melting temperature of ice I h for several commonly used models of water SPC SPC/E TIP3P TIP4P TIP4P/Ew and TIP5P obtained from computer simulations at p = 1 bar 
revious studies found that the melting temperatures of ice I h for SPC SPC/E TIP3P TIP4P TIP4P/Ew and TIP5P models were 190 215 146 232 245 and 274 K respectively 
n this water model the effect of polarization and the proper screening of interactions depending on the local environment is Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2016 178:1534–1545 – 1537 absent 
he central particle W is neutral and interacts with other particles in the system under the influence of the LJ potentials which depicts standard water molecules 
he additional particles WP and WM are bound to the central particle and carry a positive and negative charge of + q and − q respectively 
hey interact with other particles via Coulomb function and lack of LJ interactions 
he bonds WWP and W-WM are constrained to a particular distance and are symbolized as character l 
n addition the interactions between WP and WM particles inside the same coarse-grained water bead are excluded making these particles Btransparent^ to each other 
he dipole momentum of the water bead depends on the position of the charged particles and can vary from zero charged particles coincide to 2lq charged particles at the maximal distance 
harmonic angle potential with equilibrium angle θ and force constant Kθ was added to control the rotation of WP and WM particles which in turn adjust the distribution of the dipole momentum 
he average dipole momentum of the water bead is dependent on the charge distribution and was set to be on average zero in an apolar environment such as the interior of the lipid bilayer 
he mass of the charged particles as well as the mass of the central particle was set to 24 amu and summed up to 72 amu the mass of four real water molecules [ 43 
t the same time the parameterization was used as water model with bulk water density and oil/water partitioning data which reproduced a similar level of accuracy as in the standard MARTINI force field 
he equilibration was performed for 3 ns at temperature of 303 K using the Berendsen algorithm 48 and 1 bar constant pressure with the damping coefficient of 0.1 ps of the Parrinello–Rahman pressure 49 
he structures were generated as the configurations for our MD simulation with eight temperatures including 268 270 272 274 276 278 280 and 282 K 
he final MD simulation allowed us to integrate the equations of motion with a time step of 2 fs and our simulation run for totally 100 ns in the leap-frog algorithm 50 . Free Energy Landscape Calculations Free energy landscape is a method used to point out possible conformations of a molecular entity or the spatial positions of interacting molecules in a system and their corresponding energy levels 
he local minimum was defined by n-dimensional reaction coordinate V = V1 … Vn and was calculated using the function ΔG V = − kBT lnP V –lnPmax where P V represents the probability distribution and Pmax represents the maximum of the distribution which was subtracted to ΔG = 0 for lowest free energy minimum 51 52 . 1538 Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2016 178:1534–1545 Results and Discussions As shown in Fig . 1 , the total energies Etot is included the kinetic and potential terms of energy of MpAFPs system were represented as a function of time 
e used the variation in total energy of MpAFPs systems at subfreezing temperatures to determine their dependence on temperature and NaCl concentration 
his result indicates physical state transformation from liquid to solid of water molecules in the simulated complexes when subfreezing temperatures were set from 268 to 282 K and under different NaCl concentrations NaCl concentrations were set to 0.3 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l 
t 268 K water molecules surrounding MpAFP were observed to transform from liquid solution to completely frozen in 0.3 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l 
rom 270 to 274 K we found that water molecules surrounding MpAFP were frozen in both 0.3 and 0.6 mol/l concentrations liquid form was observed at this temperature range in the case where NaCl concentration was 0.8 mol/l 
t 276 K water molecules surrounding MpAFP became ice-liquid hybrid in 0.3 and 0.6 mol/l and liquid form in 0.8 mol/l 
rom 278 to 282 K water molecules surrounding MpAFP was ice-liquid hybrid in 0.3 mol/l while it remained in liquid form for both 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l 
n addition Etot value has a tendency to increase as NaCl concentration increased because of the effect of higher temperature conditions and ions are contributed to the change of kinetic energy lead to Etot value is increased when NaCl concentration increased 
pecifically at 268 K the ice state of treated complexes with different NaCl concentrations of 0.3 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l were found to be different in term of Etot 
he total energy fluctuated around −62e + 03 kJ/mol in 0.3 and 0.6 mol/l and around −59e + 03 kJ/mol in 0.8 mol/l or along liquid form but the Etot of complex simulated at 278 K fluctuated around −55e + 03 kJ/mol in 0.6 mol/l and −53e + 03 kJ/mol in 0.8 mol/l 
hus the freezing process and energy states of the complexes were dependent upon NaCl concentration in marine environment 
pecifically water molecules surrounding MpAFPs were completely frozen from 268 to 274 K and ice-liquid hybrid from 276 to 282 K at 0.3 mol/l 
n the other hand water molecules surrounding Fig . 1 The total energy Etot kJ/mol of the MpAFP systems at different NaCl concentrations of 0.3 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l and different temperatures from 268 to 282 K Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2016 178:1534–1545 1539 MpAFPs at 0.6 mol/l were frozen from 268 to 274 K ice-liquid at 276 K and existed in liquid state at temperatures of equal and greater than 278 K 
n sum these results described the behaviors of water molecules surrounding MpAFP at subfreezing temperature in which the formation and expansion of ice crystal led to the decrease of thermodynamic properties of the system and total energy of MpAFPs systems 
he gww r tended to increase in peak number and height when water molecules surrounding MpAFP formed ice crystal or ice-liquid hybrid 
he gww r was used to identify temperature regions of water molecules surrounding MpAFP at different states ice crystal or ice-liquid hybrid or liquid and subsequently its activity under subfreezing condition 
igure 2 showed the gww r of water molecules surrounding MpAFP at different temperatures in different marine environments with NaCl concentrations of 0.3 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l 
t 268 K the gww r fluctuated around 5 r for first peak 2.3 r for second peak 1.85 r for third peak and 1 r for fourth peak for all of three NaCl concentrations 
his means water molecules surrounding MpAFP were completely frozen for all three NaCl concentrations and that MpAFP was not able to inhibit ice formation process 
rom 270 to 274 K the gww r value of water molecules surrounding MpAFP in 0.8 mol/l fluctuated around the first peak 3.9 r the second peak 1.5 r and the third peak 1.3 r ) ) while the gww r ) values of water molecules surrounding MpAFP in 0.3 and 0.6 mol/l were not changed comparing to the complex simulated at 268 K 
t these temperatures the water Fig . 2 The radial distribution function RDF gww r of water–water at NaCl concentrations of 0.3 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l at different temperatures from 268 to 282 K 
ere r is the distance between water–water molecules 1540 Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2016 178:1534–1545 molecules surrounding MpAFP existed in solid state at 0.3 and 0.6 mol/l and existed in liquid state at 0.8 mol/l 
t 276 K the peak height of the water gww r surrounding MpAFP at 0.3 and 0.6 mol/l were higher than at 0.8 mol/l 
uch phenomenon occurred when the water molecules surrounding MpAFP at 0.3 and 0.6 mol/l existed in ice-liquid hybrid form while in 0.8 mol/l existed in liquid form 
rom 278 to 282 K water molecules surrounding MpAFP were found to form ice-liquid hybrid at 0.3 mol/l and liquid solution at 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l 
nd the neighboring atoms of a given atom as those atoms which have an interatomic distance less than a cutoff radius of 3.5 Å equal to the distance to the minimum between the first and the second peaks of the pair correlation function 53 
ased on the bond-oriented order parameter profiles the results in Fig . 3 show that a For the complexes in 0.3 mol/l the Fig . 3a showed that water molecules surrounding MpAFP was completely frozen at 268 to 274 K and in ice-liquid hybrid form from 276 to 282 K. ( b For the complexes in 0.6 mol/l the Fig . 3b showed that water molecules surrounding MpAFPs was completely frozen from 268 to 274 K and ice-liquid hybrid at 276 K 
ith the temperatures of equal and greater than 278 K the water molecules surrounding MpAFP was in liquid solution . c For the complexes in 0.8 mol/l the Fig . 3c showed that water molecules surrounding MpAFP was mostly frozen at 268 K 
t was in liquid format temperatures of equal and greater than 270 K. Fig . 3 The profile of the globally averaged bond-orientation order parameter vs the temperatures 
ere the Q4 Q6 Ŵ4 Ŵ6 were corresponding to the four bond order parameters to identify different crystal structures Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2016 178:1534–1545 1541 Figures 4 and 5 showed the free energy landscape of all complexes which allowed us to establish fundamental understanding on the interaction between water molecules and ice-binding site of MpAFP at subfreezing temperatures using local minimum energy as indicator in which x axis represents the radius of gyration Rg and y axis represents the root mean-square deviation Fig . 4 Free energy landscapes of MpAFP complexes from 268 to 274 K under different NaCl concentrations of 0.3 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l plotted as a function of root mean square deviation RMSD and radius of gyration Rg 1542 Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2016 178:1534–1545 Fig . 5 Free energy landscapes of MpAFP complexes from 276 to 282 K under different NaCl concentrations of 0.3 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l , plotted as a function of root mean square deviation RMSD and radius of gyration Rg ( RMSD ) 
ased on free energy landscape values we were able to select representative trajectories by identifying the local minimum energy regions of free energy landscapes and also could find out temperature regions that MpAFP remained active 
n detail Fig . 4 shows free energy landscape of MpAFP in marine environment with various NaCl concentrations of 0.3 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l from 268 to 274 K 
n this case water molecules surrounding MpAFP were completely frozen the ice crystal inhibited and paralyzed the MpAFP activity 
rom 270 to 274 K the local minimum energy regions of MpAFP were found to be particularly discrete in 0.3 and 0.6 mol/l while that was extended in 0.8 mol/l 
nder these temperatures water molecules formed ice crystal network in both of 0.3 and 0.6 mol/l and liquid solution in 0.8 mol/l 
he free energy landscapes of MpAFPs under NaCl concentrations of 0.3 0.6 and 0.8 mol/ l from 276 to 282 K were shown in the Fig . 5 
t 276 K with the result of free energy landscape we found that water molecules surrounding MpAFPs formed ice-liquid hybrid in 0.3 and 0.6 mol/l and liquid solution in 0.8 mol/l which correspond to the expansion of the local minimum energy regions 
rom 278 to 282 K based on local minimum regions we were able to identify that water molecules surrounding MpAFP formed ice-liquid hybrid in 0.3 mol/l and liquid solution at 0.6 and 0.8 mol/l concentrations . Conclusions In this work we used coarse-grained simulation to study the active MpAFP at low temperatures in combination with different NaCl concentrations 
e explored three important findings as follows 1 the MpAFP could not be active under low NaCl concentration ( in 0.3 mol/l and low temperatures 
nder 0.6 mol/l NaCl concentration and the temperatures of equal or greater than 278 K the MpAFP obtained its active conformation at these subfreezing temperatures 
herefore active temperature region of MpAFP was extended to lower temperatures when NaCl concentration increased . 2 In three cases the phase transformation of water was found to be dependent on NaCl concentrations the MpAFP systems allowed us to search for phase space and to locate active conformation in consistent direction than standard single temperature setup . 3 With coarse-grained simulation the computing expenses were reduced a significant way

revious study showed that ice growth is kinetically inhibited by AFPs covering the water accessible surfaces of ice 20 
FPs are particularly sensitive to cooling condition as their molecular adaptation to ice crystal is induced through the gradual formation of ice cascade surrounding AFP which can also be interpreted as AFPs can be inactivated if subfreezing temperature suddenly drops 24 
he concentration of NaCl greatly affects the crystallization process of sea water 
ince the melting temperature of ice I h for the TIP4P model is now known 46 , it is possible to use the Gibbs–Duhem methodology 47 to evaluate the melting temperature of ice I h for other potential models of water 
n this research the coarse-grained water model is represented as one of the major simplification of the solvent which can be implicitly or explicitly modeled as a van der Waals particle 
n addition the polarizable coarse-grained water molecules are represented by three particles instead of one as in the standard Martini force field 
n turn the charged particles can rotate around the W particle 
n this research the parameterization of polarizable coarse-grained water model was used in combination with the coarse-grained MARTINI force field 
he three bead model representing four water molecules was used to show the effective accountability of real water-oriented polarity 
onsequently the dielectric screening of bulk water was reproduced 
n this research local minimum of an energy landscape corresponding to metastable low temperature states of a thermodynamic system was used to determine representative trajectories by identifying the local minimum energy regions of free energy landscapes 
n addition we also found that Etot values of the complexes changed as NaCl concentrations changed 
inally for the simulated complexes with 0.8 mol/ l only the complex at 268 K was completely frozen while the remaining complexes existed in liquid state 
s seen from Fig . 2 the radial distribution function was further used to describe the behavior of water molecules surrounding MpAFP under subfreezing condition 
he radial distribution functions were measured to analyze the distances of water molecules that come into contact with MpAFP 
he measurement was represented by the gww r values or distances between water molecules surrounding MpAFP 
he bond-oriented order parameters was also used as a method to determine the crystalline structure of liquid compound when which is changed from liquid to solid transition 
he idea of the bond order parameters is to capture the symmetry of bond orientations regardless of the bond lengths 
he bond was defined as the vector joining a pair of neighboring atoms 
hen MpAFP was in ice or ice-liquid hybrid environment the residues of MpAFP would be inhibited by ice crystal which led to the formation of Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2016 178:1534–1545 1543 limited stable configurations 
n contrast when MpAFP is in liquid environment the residues of MpAFP form active configurations which lead to expansion of local minimum energy regions as well as number local minimum energy regions 
e have found basic behaviors of MpAFP in inhibiting the freezing process of water molecules at low temperatures under various NaCl concentrations 
nder 0.8 mol/l NaCl concentration MpAFP was activated at the temperatures much lower than comparing to the MpAFP in 0.6 mol/l NaCl concentration the temperatures equal or larger 270 K

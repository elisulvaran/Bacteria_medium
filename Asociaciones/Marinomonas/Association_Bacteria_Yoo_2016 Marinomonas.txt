o the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on serine protease of Marinomonas species 
eywords Serine protease  Substrate specificity  Marinomonas species  Marine bacterium  Introduction Among the different industrial enzymes, proteases, which can be obtained from plants, animals, and microbial sources, the latter such as bacteria [1, 2]  & Jae Kweon Park jkpark@gachon.ac.kr 1  Department of Life Sciences, Gachon University, Seongnamdaero 1342, Seongnam-Si, Gyeonggi-do 461-701, South Korea  account for up to 60 % of protease sources in various industries including food, detergents, production of nutritionally important amino acids, and pharmaceutical manufacture applications 
ffects of detergents, such as DMSO, EDTA, Triton X-100, and SDS and divalent metal ions, on ProA activity were tested; detergents were added to a final concentration of 0.1–5.0 % and at a concentration of 1.0 mM.  To expand the effective utilization and enzymatic processing of protease (ProA), we have isolated and identified a gram-negative marine microbial strain Marinomonas arctica from sea–soil called Getpearl collected in InCheoncity, South Korea

ars indicate 1 nucleotide substitution per 100 nucleotides  123  Bioprocess Biosyst Eng (2016) 39:307–314  These results indicate that the strain PT-1 has considerable sequence homology with a wide variety of Marinomonas species, no particular genus of Marinomonas species has been exploited for the production of halophilic protease with wide variety of substrate specificities 
hese results quite differ from other data base obtained from Pseudoalteromonas [20, 21], Bacillus [22], and Marinomonas species [17, 18] known as proteolytic enzyme producers 
aken together, based on the results of 16S rRNA sequence, phylogenetic tree, and major fatty acid composition analyses, we concluded that M. arctica  Bioprocess Biosyst Eng (2016) 39:307–314  311  Table 1 Major compositions of fatty acids of Marinomonas arctica PT-1 Fatty acids  Average content (%)  C12:0  0.09 ± 0.003  C14:0  0.05 ± 0.009  C16:0  0.50 ± 0.024  C16:1  0.14 ± 0.007  C18:0  0.15 ± 0.011  C18:1  0.49 ± 0.026  C18:3 Unidentified  0.01 ± 0.004 2.33 ± 0.176  PT-1 can be classified as a novel marine bacterial strain isolated as a specific ProA producer 
t is worthy to note that our study provides the first report on the production and purification of a native Marinomonas arctica’s proteolytic enzyme.  Fig. 3 SDS-PAGE analysis of ProA

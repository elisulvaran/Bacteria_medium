ittle is known about the structure and role of microbial communities in fish aquaculture particularly at larval developmental stages where the fish microbiome develops and host animals are most susceptible to disease 
arly- 2 days after hatching and late-stage 34 days after hatching fish larvae presented remarkably divergent bacterial consortia with the genera Pseudoalteromonas Marinomonas Acinetobacter and Acidocella besides several unclassified Alphaproteobacteria dominating the former and Actinobacillus Streptococcus Massilia Paracoccus and Pseudomonas being prevalent in the latter 
urthermore we observed the recruitment into host tissues of several bacterial phylotypes—including putative pathogens as well as mutualists—that were detected at negligible densities in rearing-water or in the live feed i.e. rotifers and artemia 
hese results suggest that besides host-driven selective forces both the live feed and the surrounding rearing environment contribute to shaping the microbiome of farmed gilthead sea-bream larvae and that a differential establishment of host-associated bacteria takes place during larval development 
arly molecular surveys based on fingerprinting techniques such as PCR-DGGE and T-RFLP have enabled a broader characterization of microbial assemblages in farmed fish to be made than previous studies relying on microbial cultivation-dependent methods revealing the predominance of Proteobacteria Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the gastrointestinal GI tract of fish Pond et al. 2006 Hovda et al. 2007 Nayak 2010 
ecent NGS assessments of the fish microbiome not only have continued to focus on the GI apparatus gut intestine and their contents of adult fish Rurangwa et al. 2015 Smith et al. 2015 Schmidt et al. 2016 improving our knowledge of the microbiome of commercially valuable teleost species such as trout carp sturgeon and cod see Llewellyn et al. , 2014 for a comprehensive review 
he first demonstration of bacteria adhering to fish eggs dates back 60 years ago Oppenheimer 1955 and the importance of early-stage microbes to fish survival development and disease susceptibility is well-known Hansen and Olafsen 1999 Olafsen 2001 Vadstein et al. , 2013 
ecent molecular-based studies have enabled a better circumscription of the bacterial consortia associated with for instance cod larvae Bakke et al. 2013 2015 , but comprehensive knowledge of the structure of microbial communities especially regarding the identity of their dominant and rare members relevant to intensive fish larviculture still needs to be determined for a wide range of economically important species 
n this study we used a trans-disciplinary approach coupling state-of-the-art fish larviculture to NGS taxonomic profiling of bacterial communities to delineate the autochthonous bacterial consortium of farmed gilthead seabream larvae and to reveal the participation of exogenous microorganisms in shaping this consortium

Fish farming is the fastest-growing segment within the global agribusiness with a compound annual growth rate of 9 % ( FAO 2014 
ost of the gilthead seabream farming takes place in southern European countries Greece Italy Spain Portugal and France and Turkey and the fish is exported chiefly within the European market as a highly valuable reared species FAO 2012 
esides the typical r-selection strategy of most fish species characterized by high reproductive recruitment but low survival of the young high mortality rates observed in fish larviculture are believed to result from greater disease incidence caused by opportunistic/pathogenic bacteria Olafsen 2001 Hache and Plante 2011 Vadstein et al. 2013 
ost of the efforts in this regard have focused on the manipulation of existing microbiota and/or enhancing disinfection protocols– e.g. through the use of few culturable pre- and probiotic bacteria and on the treatment cleaning or circulation of the rearing water Makridis et al. 2005 Sáenz De Rodrigáñez et al. 2009 Conceição et al. 2010 Attramadal et al. 2012 
et wider exploitation of the entire aquaculture microbiota for improved fish rearing although desirable remains difficult owing to our limited view of the identity and activity of the majority of microorganisms that mediate nutrient cycling and disease incidence in land-based fish farming 
n fact the diversity and function of free-living and host-associated microorganisms in fish larviculture has seldom been investigated constituting a true gap of knowledge not only in aquaculture Vadstein et al. 2013 but also in fish physiology developmental and microbiome research 
his hinders our understanding of the establishment of microbial communities in early fish developmental stages and thus a more comprehensive perspective of fish biology in the light of its associated microbiome 
he application of next-generation sequencing NGS technologies to the study of host-associated microorganisms is spurring significant advances in our understanding of symbiotic relationships and metazoan evolution Rosenberg et al. 2007 Consortium 2012 Hentschel et al. 2012 Egan et al. 2013 McFall-Ngai 2014

hao1 richness estimates retrieved for both 2 DAH and 34 DAH rearing-water were about 3-fold higher than the corresponding observed bacterial richness values Figure 2A 
he difference between observed and estimated richness was not as pronounced and often negligible for the host-associated bacterial communities Figure 2A 
s expected due to their high richness values bacterial communities from 2 and 34 DAH tank water were the most susceptible to the removal of singleton OTUs Table 1 Figure 2B averaging 193.5 ± 41.16 and 97.25 ± 25.90 OTUs per sample , respectively Figure 2B 
eduction in richness values were not as pronounced in hostassociated samples Figure 2B and in comparative terms both datasets with and without singletons revealed the same trends concerning shifts in bacterial richness across sample categories Figures 2A B 
hannon diversity indices—which consider not only the number of bacterial phylotypes i.e. OTUs but also their relative abundances in each sample—obtained for fish larvae 2 and 34 DAH were usually significantly higher than those registered for the live feed Figure 2C , suggesting greater equitability among community members in fish larvae than in the live feed 
iversity estimates did not change significantly after removal of singleton OTUs Figure 2C . Statistical Analyses Normality Shapiro-Wilk and equal variance tests were performed to inspect the distribution of the OTU richness and diversity measures as well as of relative abundance values of the most dominant bacterial phyla and genera found across the seven sample categories all estimated from 454-pyrosequencing data 
ne-Way Analysis of Variance ANOVA was performed on log-transformed alpha diversity measures OTU richness Chao1 and Shannon indices all of which showing normal data distributions to test whether mean values obtained for all sample groups were equal followed by all pair-wise multiple comparison procedures using the Holm-Sidak method to determine significance between groups , in our case the seven sample categories 
he Kruskal-Wallis test One-Way ANOVA on Ranks was employed to test whether the relative abundances of the most dominant bacterial phyla and genera changed significantly across the seven sample categories given the absence of normal data distributions in most cases 
ackknifed beta-diversity procedures were run within the QIIME environment jackknifed_beta_diversity.py to test the statistical validity of sample groups generated by cluster and ordination PCoA analyses of OTU data and thus whether bacterial community profiles generated by 454 pyrosequencing could discriminate between the seven sample categories defined in this study 
he Similarity Percentage SIMPER test Clarke 1993 was run on PAST software Hammer et al. 2001 version 3.10 to identify which bacterial OTUs contributed the most to the Bray-Curtis dissimilarities observed among microhabitats .

o more specifically address the relative contribution of live feed and rearing-water as bacterial vectors for mature fish larvae a Venn diagram was constructed using OTUs detected in the live feed pooling of rotifers and artemia nauplii and metanauplii samples 34 DAH rearing-water , and 34 DAH fish larvae as discrete OTU pools Figure 5B 
e further built one diagram in which the live feed was divided into rotifers artemia nauplii and artemia metanauplii as single categories to determine their own unique contribution to shaping bacterial communities in 34 DAH larvae Figure 5C

rends revealed by community ordination remained unchanged when analyses were undertaken in the absence of singleton OTUs Figure S1 Supplementary Material . Specific and Shared OTUs across Microhabitats To determine how many and which OTUs were common or specific to each sample category we explored the full non-normalized quality-filtered dataset using Venn diagrams where replicate samples per category were pooled Figure 5 
uite surprisingly only five bacterial OTUs were common to all 2 and 34 DAH rearing-water and fish larvae sample categories Figure 5A

ee Figure S1 for analyses performed after exclusion of singleton OTUs from the dataset . Because OTUs represented by one read are by definition sample-specific removal of singletons from the data led to a substantial reduction in the number of OTUs exclusive to each sample category whereas the number of OTUs common Bradyrhizobium , 1387 Sphingomonas , and 1970 Acidocella 
owever the effect caused by singleton exclusion did not erode the picture of a larger pool of OTUs specific to than shared by sample categories Figures S2A–C . DISCUSSION Bacterial communities in fish larviculture constitute a large reservoir of genetic and metabolic diversity that should not be undervalued in management practices 
ndeed we found that several sample categories namely the live feed and 34 DAH rearing-water bacterial communities were dominated by very few bacterial phylotypes OTUs 
n contrast we verified that additional bacterial richness is likely to be revealed especially in rearingwater samples if further sequencing effort is applied as suggested by the difference between observed and estimated richness values obtained for these consortia Figures 2A B 
ecause the methodology employed here enabled us to uncover highly diverse bacterial consortia particularly in fish larvae and 2 DAH rearing-water and also in other marine symbiotic consortia–see e.g. Hardoim et al . 2014 , the lower diversity/high dominance observed in the live feed and 34 DAH rearing-water is most likely indicative of a non-natural pattern of bacterial community structuring 
otifers and artemia used in fish larviculture are commonly maintained in captivity under long-term steady conditions e.g. kept in microalgal cultures at 15–18◦ C Ferreira 2009 
his is likely to reduce the diversity of their naturally occurring microbial consortia eventually contributing to the prevalence of fewer microorganisms in these hosts that are able to cope with the processing and maintenance procedures 
ccumulation of larval metabolic waste products via defecation increase of dead biomass be it from microalgae food items or the larvae themselves and the density of the microalgae daily applied to the rearing tanks may all contribute FIGURE 5 | Sharedness and specificity of bacterial phylotypes in gilthead seabream larviculture

The Bacteriome of Fish Larvae less likely to possess crucial relevance to larval physiology and metabolism since their occurrence in association with the host was not favored 
or instance two Pseudomonas OTUs 705 and 1953 contribute to the quite high abundance of this genus in mature fish larvae 
hey display close phylogenetic relationship with P. fragi Miller et al. 1973 Cormier et al. 1991 and P. lini Delorme et al. 2002 respectively , and extremely low abundances in live feed samples Table S1 
lthough the life-strategy of P. fragi and relatives is suggestive of typical opportunistic behavior with pathogenic potential there is currently no evidence for the participation of either P. fragi and P. lini as aethiological agents of disease in fish 
he Oxalobacteraceae family is metabolically diverse and includes strict anaerobes aerobes and nitrogen-fixing organisms 
hylogenetic inference suggests that OTU 928 is a member of the genus Massilia Table S3 a relatively widespread taxon registered in soils soil crusts air and humans La Scola et al. 1998 Ferrari et al. 2005 Gundlapally and Garcia-Pichel 2006 Kämpfer et al. , 2011 
further dominant taxon in 34 DAH larvae which was however absent in all other microhabitats the genus Actinobacillus Gammaproteobacteria Pasteurellaceae contains species recognized as parasites or pathogens of mammals birds and reptiles Slots and Ting 1999 Kuhnert and Christensen 2008 Macinnes et al. 2012 
ctinobacillus spp . have already been documented in aquaculture ponds Ampofo and Clerk 2003 , and there is no current evidence of their role as fish pathogens 
imilarly we observed two OTUs 1128 and 2143 that primarily contribute to the abundance of the genus Streptococcus Firmicutes in 34 DAH larvae but were detected neither in water nor in live feed samples 
everal Streptococcus spp . are known to cause disease in fish and S. iniae is a leading pathogen in aquaculture worldwide Baiano and Barnes 2009 
hylogenetic inference indicates that our OTUs are more closely related with the human pathogenic species S. dysgalactiae and S. infantis/mitis Table S3 
articularly S. dysgalactiae has been recently recognized as an emerging pathogen infecting a wide variety of fish species Abdelsalam et al. 2013 causing e.g. necrosis in the caudal peduncles and high mortality rates in cultured amberjack Seriola dumerili and yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata ( Nomoto et al. , 2004 
n spite of the high water renewal rates employed in our trial all these increments influence the quality and quantity of the dissolved and particulate organic matter present in rearing tanks thus most likely playing an important role in the selection of fewer microorganisms prevailing under the presumed more eutrophic conditions at late larval rearing stages 
embers of this family play a role in marine secondary production and require complex carbon sources for growth being usually found in association with phytoplankton blooms and in environments rich in organic carbon Zhou et al. 2013 Bowman 2014 
he genera Loktanella dominant in rotifers and Paracoccus dominant in artemia metanauplii are bacterial groups in the Rhodobacteraceae family Alphaproteobacteria with potential probiotic activity Hjelm et al. 2004 Makridis et al. 2005 Yan et al. 2014 
hese taxa were abundant in the live feed but were very scarce in rearing-water and fish larvae 
igher Loktanella spp . proportions were found on fronds of the macroalga Ulva australis than in seawater Burke et al. 2011 and they ranked as the prevailing culturable bacteria associated with laboratory strains of microalgae Schwenk et al. , 2014 
he sole but highly abundant Paracoccus phylotype OTU 2374 found in artemia metanauplii displays closest 16S rRNA gene relatedness with P. zeaxanthinifaciens Table S3 a bacterium isolated from seaweed found to produce the yellow carotenoid zeaxanthin a compound applied in poultry pigmentation and in the prevention of age-related degeneration in humans Berry et al. , 2003 
ts low abundance in rearing-water both at 2 and 34 DAH suggests that this strain may accumulate into live feed tissue especially Artemia spp . through filtering activity and then pass onto fish larvae through feeding 
n the specific context of our gilthead seabream larval rearing both Loktanella and Paracoccus are apparently Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 12 February 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 204 Califano et al . The Bacteriome of Fish Larvae the case of widespread P. atlantica Corpe 1973 Holmström and Kjelleberg 1999 
everal Pseudoalteromonas strains including representatives of P. undina and P. espejiana were found to present no virulence toward gilthead sea-bream juveniles Pujalte et al. 2007 , and therefore we suggest that the interaction of these species with sea-bream larvae is rather of a commensalistic or mutualistic nature 
he fish larvae-associated community shifts markedly in structure at 34 DAH whereby genera such as Pseudomonas Actinobacillus Streptococcus Massilia and Paracoccus prevailed 
t is likely that the above-mentioned changes are to a considerable extent driven by the higher degree of tissue compartmentalization and thus distinct niche availability in fully developed fish larvae 
urther changes in the quality and quantity of available organic carbon that take place during larval rearing Vadstein et al. 2013 certainly influence the dynamics and propagation of microorganisms in the system possibly playing a role in the differential enrichment of bacterial phylotypes at early and late larval developmental stages observed here 
earing in mind the limitations of 16S rRNA gene approaches in delivering accurate species-level identification and therefore serving as proxies for pathogenicity among the bacteria Martins et al. 2013 , we here offer a cautious interpretation of potential symbiotic vs. pathogenic behavior derived from taxonomy data 
evertheless our methodological approach delivered a sound diagnosis of the status of the larva-associated bacterial communities and shifts thereof 
ertainly manifold factors such as intrinsic features of the larviculture system itself the quality and the indigenous microbiota of the water supply the reared species the chosen diet and environmental parameters among others are all supposed to play a role in shaping the larviculture microbial consortia 
herefore continued research effort is needed for a broader understanding of the dynamics of these microbial communities across several model fish species and rearing conditions if we are to effectively manipulate these assemblages for improved land-based fish larviculture . detect Streptococcus and Actinobacillus-related sequences in live feed and tank water the actual source s of these phylotypes to the fish larvae could not be verified 
or Streptococcus spp . particularly their presence in 2 DAH larvae suggests that they are early fish colonizers with the ability to persist and eventually increase in abundance as the host develops 
ur data strengthen previous observations concerning the disparity between bacterial community profiles from fish larvae and their corresponding live feed Bakke et al. 2013 2015 
owever we posit that the latter are actual participants in shaping the fish larvae microbiome and might bear importance as latent vectors of bacterial associates of fish 
t may be driven by diverse mechanisms such as host filtering/drinking activity parental symbiont transmission and host-derived chemical cues besides the high doubling rates of opportunistic bacteria during favorable conditions 
ltogether all seven sample categories represented microbial communities that significantly differ in structure Figure 4 and Figure S1 , even if only presence/absence OTU data are considered Figure 4D and Figure S1D 
he extent of between-replicate variability in community distance measures within any given sample category was much reduced when OTU relative abundances were considered in both datasets with and without singletons Figure 4B and Figure S1B , highlighting the importance of taxon abundance ranks in determining consistency in community assembly patterns 
e here describe the autochthonous bacterial consortium of early-stage gilthead seabream larvae as a quite diverse Figure 2C , readily detectable community of prevalently alpha—and gammaproteobacterial lineages Figure 3B emerging prior to host ’ s mouth opening and complex tissues ’ development

urther support was provided to the Institute for Bioengineering and Biosciences by “ Programa Operacional Regional de Lisboa 2020 ” Project N. 007317 . In this study we diagnosed an intriguing pattern of hostdriven enrichment and de-selection of bacterial phlotypes in both 2 and 34 DAH gilthead seabream larvae highlighting the relative contribution of the environment rearing-water and the live feed as sources of bacteria and of selective pressures in shaping the microbiome of early-stage fish larvae 
etermining the mutualistic or eventual pathogenic nature of these bacterial associates will lead to a much improved understanding of the relevance and dynamics of the fish larvae microbiome

urther at 34 DAH bacterial community diversity in the rearing-water was even lower than fish larvae diversity Holm-Sidak t = 3.247 P = 0.005 Figure 2C in spite of the much higher richness values registered for 34 DAH rearingwater in comparison with larvae Figure 2A

ncompassing 1,068 OTUs these singletons represented a significant fraction of the bacterial richness captured in this survey but a rather negligible proportion 1.3 % of the total number of analyzed reads 
ur results contrast high bacterial richness measures obtained elsewhere for the live feed used in cod larval rearing Bakke et al. 2015 likely reflecting the different sampling strategies employed in these studies , since we opted for collecting the live feed prior to their addition to the rearing tanks 
he decrease in bacterial diversity observed in 34 DAH rearing-water could derive not only from the selection of populations performing well under controlled parameters but also from the presumably higher amounts of organic matter in larviculture tanks at late rearing stages 
eplicate samples were pooled to portray the total number of bacterial phylotypes recovered within each sample category 
wing to the high-throughput nature of our analysis we were able to unmask several bacterial populations OTUs whose distribution across the studied microhabitats exemplifies a mode of bacterial acquisition characterized by sharp enrichment within host tissues of otherwise extremely low abundant populations in the live feed or in the environmental surroundings 
ts prevalence at the later larval stage is well justified by its presence in Artemia metanauplii samples only even if at low abundances

hat highlights the reduction in bacterial diversity from 2 DAH to 34 DAH rearing-water is an increase in abundance from 21.8 to 71.6 % Figure 3 Table 2 of one single OTU affiliated with the Cryomorphaceae family Bacteroidetes 
lthough not verified experimentally the increase in Cryomorphaceae in rearing-water during the trial may correlate with the cumulative introduction of microalgae to the tanks 
ndeed the total Cryomorphaceae abundance in 2 DAH rearing-water c. 23 % can already be considered quite high surpassing by 10-fold the amount of Cryomorphaceae found in the natural input water i.e. water from the Ria Formosa lagoon Olhão Costa et al. unpublished data 
esides the rather sharp increase in abundance of Cryomorphaceae in the rearing-water during the experiment several other OTUs could be identified as distinguishing bacterial taxa among microhabitats 
esides its pronounced dominance in artemia metanauplii the genus Paracoccus was quite abundant in artemia nauplii but only moderately abundant in 34 DAH larvae 
owever it tends not to be present in such high densities in the fish host as observed in the live feed but rather to be a regular constituent member of a more diversified fish bacterial consortium 
his could also partially explain the higher bacterial diversity found in 34 DAH than in 2 DAH larvae 
uture cultivation-independent functional studies of the fish larval microbiota enabled e.g. via shotgun DNA sequencing will be fundamental to more adequately address the relative proportions of mutualistic vs. pathogenic traits of bacterial associates at early vs. late larval rearing stages advancing our current knowledge in this regard besides 16S rRNA gene-centered bacterial taxonomic profiling 
ased on our results we envision the fish host intermittently subjected to a succession of bacterial cohorts that shift in structure—composition diversity abundance— during larval rearing substantially contributing to a differential recruitment of bacterial associates by fish larvae as the host develops 
inally the structure of bacterial communities populating fish hatcheries is likely to shift considerably in a case-by-case manner 
or instance the assemblages of dominant bacterial genera reported here for gilthead seabream differ from those reported recently for cod larvae Bakke et al. 2015 highlighting the relevance of the host species among other factors , in shaping its symbiotic consortium 
his could either result from high competitive capacity within the emerging fish gut microbiome or cumulative host colonization from low abundant environmental populations or through both mechanisms simultaneously 
ere we reveal several bacterial phylotypes that occurred at negligible abundances in the live feed but were specifically selected for in fish larvae 
n fact such a pattern of bacterial enrichment— of either mutualists pathogens or commensals—in or on the surface of eukaryotes is common across several hostmicrobe interactions in aquatic ecosystems Webster et al. 2010 Simister et al. 2012 Costa et al. 2013 Hardoim et al. 2014 Cúcio et al. 2016 
herefore they likely represent to some extent the assemblage of pioneering bacterial settlers on eggs 
f note here is the high abundance of OTU 1296 which presented 100 % 16S rRNA gene similarity with multiple species of the genus Pseudoalteromonas e.g. P. porphyrae P. ‘ atlantica P. undina P. espejiana Table S3 
n spite of the comprehensive approach employed in this study future surveys approaching microbial diversity associated with other important components “ microhabitats ” of the system such as the microalgae commonly used in the application of the “ green water technique ” can further enhance our knowledge of the phylogenetic breadth of the microbial consortia that are relevant to fish larval rearing .

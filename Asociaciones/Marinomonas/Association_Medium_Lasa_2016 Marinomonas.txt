NAâ€“DNA hybridizations were performed to confirm the taxonomic position and the results were below the recommended threshold for species delimitation specifically 44.5 % Cmf 17.2T with M. aquimarina CECT 5080T and 55 % Cmf 18.22Twith M. aquimarina CECT 5080T 
urthermore the average nucleotide identity ANIb ANIm and OrthoANI and in silico estimated DNAâ€“DNA reassociation values among Cmf 17.2T Cmf 18.22T and M. aquimarina CECT 5080T were in all cases below the respective threshold for species differentiation

he genus was proposed by Van Landschoot & De Ley 1983 to accommodate two unusual species of the genus Alteromonas Alteromonas communis and Alteromonas vaga 
n recent years the number of described species has increased and at the time of writing the genus Marinomonas comprises 24 recognized species http //www.bacterio.net/marinomonas.html after the reclassification of Marinomonas basaltis as a later heterotypic synonym of Marinomonas communis Chimetto et al. 2011 
n this study we report the characterization of three strains belonging to the genus Marinomonas isolated from reared clams in Galicia Spain and determine their taxonomic position within the genus 
acterial isolates Cmf 17.2T Rd 20.33 and Cmf 18.22T were obtained from healthy reared clams Ruditapes decussatus on the Galician coast NW Spain 
asa and others Marinomonas aquimarina CECT 5080T was provided by the Spanish Collection of Type Cultures CECT and included in the study for taxonomic and phenotypic comparison 
equence similarities of the 16S rRNA gene were determined using the EzTaxon-e server www.eztaxone . ezbiocloud.net Kim et al. 2012 and the BLASTN program and checked with the Species Living Tree Project LTP database www.arb-silva.de/living-tree that has frequently been used for delineating bacterial species due to its high quality sequences ( Yarza et al. 2008 2014 
equences were aligned using CLUSTALW tool Larkin et al. 2007 and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the neighbourjoining NJ and maximum-likelihood ML algorithms in MEGA software package version 6.06 Tamura et al. , 2011 
istance matrices were calculated by using Kimura â€™ s twoparameter correction and stability of the groups was estimated by bootstrap analysis 1000 replicates using MEGA version 6.06 Tamura et al. 2011 
nalysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the three strains belonged to the genus Marinomonas showing the highest sequence similarity with the type strains of M. aquimarina 97.8 % â€“98.5 % , Marinomonas ostreistagni 97.3 % â€“97.4 % , Marinomonas fungiae 97.2 % â€“97.3 % , and Marinomonas brasilensis 97.1 % â€“97.2 % 
imilarity between strains Cmf 17.2T and Rd 20.33 was 99.5 % and between Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T was 97.9 % 
ccording to the LTP database sequence similarities ranging between 94.5 % and 98.7 % suggest that the microbial strain can be classified as a member of a given genus whereas higher similarities would be indicative of belonging to a given species Yarza et al. 2008 
hylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences made with NJ and ML approaches showed that the clam isolates form two different groups within the genus Fig . 1 
trains Cmf 17.2T and Rd 20.33 clustered together in an independent branch from strain Cmf 18.22T and M. aquimarina CECT 5080T suggesting that these isolates may represent two novel species 
hus Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T were selected as representative strains for further analyses . 2014 
he ANIb ANIm and OrthoANI values were calculated as described by Richter & RossellÃ³-MÃ³ra 2009 using JSpecies V1.2.1 , and Lee et al . 2015 
he DNA G+C content was estimated according to the draft genome of strains Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T and was found to be 45.3 % and 44.6 % respectively which are in the range of the genus i.e. 41â€“50 % ( Espinosa et al. 2010 
verage nucleotide identity ANI and eDDH calculations were performed to elucidate genome similarities and species assignation of strains Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T 
he values obtained using these indexes Table 1 were below the respective thresholds 95â€“ 96 % ANI and 70 % eDDH indicating that these strains represent two novel species of the genus 
dditionally OrthoANI Lee et al. 2015 values showed similarities of 76.26 % between M. aquimarina CECT 5080T and Cmf 17.2T 76.01 % between M. aquimarina CECT 5080T and Cmf 18.22T and 90.75 % between strains Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T 
DH experiments were undertaken between the strains Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T against the type strain of the species with highest similarity in the 16S rRNA gene M. aquimarina CECT 5080T 
B and BA were performed and were generally within the limits of this method Goris et al. 1998 
esults obtained from DDH experiments between Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T with M. aquimarina CECT 5080T confirmed their separate status at the species level since the reassociation values were always below the recommended threshold 44.5 % reassociation value for Cmf 17.2T with M. aquimarina CECT 5080T and 55 % reassociation value for Cmf 18.22T with M. aquimarina CECT 5080T 
he reassociation value between strains Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T was 45.5 % . High Pure PCR Template Preparation kit Roche was employed for isolation of genomic DNA for whole-genome sequencing and DNAâ€“DNA hybridization DDH experiments 
he genomes of strains Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T were sequenced at Sistemas GenÃ³micos Valencia Spain using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology

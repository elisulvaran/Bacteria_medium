Appl Biochem Biotechnol (2016) 178:1534â€“1545 DOI 10.1007/s12010-015-1966-7  Exploring the Effects of Subfreezing Temperature and Salt Concentration on Ice Growth Inhibition of Antarctic Gram-Negative Bacterium Marinomonas Primoryensis Using Coarse-Grained Simulation Hung Nguyen 1 & Thanh Dac Van 1,2 & Nhut Tran 1 & Ly Le 1,2  Received: 16 November 2015 / Accepted: 21 December 2015 / Published online: 12 January 2016 # Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016  Abstract The aim of this work is to study the freezing process of water molecules surrounding Antarctic Gram-negative bacterium Marinomonas primoryensis antifreeze protein (MpAFP) and the MpAFP interactions to the surface of ice crystals under various marine environments (at different NaCl concentrations of 0.3, 0.6, and 0.8 mol/l) 
n recent study, Shuaiqi Guo and colleagues found a Ca2+-dependent protein with molecular density of 1.5-MDa has particular ice-binding property, called Marinomonas primoryensis antifreeze protein (MpAFP)

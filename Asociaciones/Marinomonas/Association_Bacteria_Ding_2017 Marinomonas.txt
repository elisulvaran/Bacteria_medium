iscussion In the present study a thermostable β-1,3-galactosidase MaBGA was successfully purified to homogeneity from Marinomonas sp 
he purification results showed that the two-step purification method is efficient for separating MaBGA from the wild-type strain of Marinomonas sp 
Si20414 which also provides a reference for extracting other proteins from strains belonging to the genus of Marinomonas 
dditionally MaBGA only shared high identity > 70 % with BGAs of the genus Marinomonas and no sequence with identity more than 55 % was found in their related marine species 
t is supposed that the ancestor of the genus Marinomonas acquired the gene encoding thermophilic β-galactosidase from other thermophiles by occasional horizontal transfer then experienced adaptive evolution under low-temperature marine environments for a long period which led to a decrease in thermal stability without selection pressures 
trains Plasmids and Culture Conditions Strain BSi20414 used as the source of β-galactosidase was isolated from a core sample of sea ice collected from Canada Basin Arctic Ocean and was characterized as Marinomonas in our previous study 22

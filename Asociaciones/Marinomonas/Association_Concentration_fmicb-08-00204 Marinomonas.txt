 arly- (2 days after hatching) and late-stage (34 days after hatching) fish larvae presented remarkably divergent bacterial consortia, with the genera Pseudoalteromonas, Marinomonas, Acinetobacter, and Acidocella (besides several unclassified Alphaproteobacteria) dominating the former, and Actinobacillus, Streptococcus, Massilia, Paracoccus, and Pseudomonas being prevalent in the latter 
 e determine bacterial community composition and diversity during a gilthead seabream larval rearing trial using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes amplified from the metagenomes of (1) fish larvae at early [2 days after hatching (DAH)] and late (34 DAH) developmental stages, (2) their live feed, and (3) rearingwater.  Fish farming is the fastest-growing segment within the global agribusiness, with a compound annual growth rate of 9% (FAO, 2014) 
 ilthead seabream eggs were obtained from broodstock under captivity at EPPO-IPMA, and incubated at 18 ± 0.5◦ C in 200 L cylindro-conical fiberglass tanks at a density of 0.5 g.L −1 for 2 days 
 ive preys were provided ad libitum, with a minimum concentration of c. five rotifers and one artemia nauplii. mL−1 to compensate for the restricted larval mobility at the earliest developmental stages 
 earing-water samples consisted of 2 L volumes taken separately from each of the four experimental tanks at 2 and 34 DAH using disinfected (70% ethanol) plastic beakers, thereby comprising four independent replicates from each sampling point

 hermal cycling involved a touchdown procedure to improve the retrieval of amplicons of the correct size (especially needed for 16S rRNA gene amplification from TC-DNA of 2 DAH larvae), with initial denaturation at 94◦ C for 4 min, followed by 10 cycles of 30 s at 94◦ C, 45 s at 65–55◦ C and 1 min at 68◦ C 
 urther 20 cycles followed as described above, except for the use of a constant annealing temperature of 55◦ C and a final elongation step at 68◦ C for 10 min 
 hese comprised (i) estimates of bacterial richness (Chao1) and diversity (Shannon’s index) across microhabitats, (ii) phylum- and genus-level bacterial composition in individual and pooled samples per microhabitat, (iii) determination of OTUs specific to and shared by microhabitats using Venn diagrams, and (iv) multivariate analysis of OTU data 
 arval samples (independent replicates from 2 and 34 DAH, Figure 1) were then transferred to sterile, 2 mL polypropylene tubes and stored at −80◦ C until TC-DNA extraction 
 ive feed replicate samples consisted of 0.2 g pools of each rotifers, artemia nauplii and metanauplii placed into sterile, 2 mL polypropylene tubes after harvesting with disinfected beakers and gentle rinsing (3x) with sterile artificial seawater 
 arvae, rotifer and artemia (nauplii and metanauplii) samples were first thoroughly homogenized in 500 µL artificial sterile seawater using a 10 cm3 PotterElvehjem PTFE pestle and glass tube (Scherf-Präzision Europa GmbH, Meiningen, Germany) before being subjected to TCDNA extraction 
 his consisted of two successive, 1 h incubation periods with 10 mg/mL lysozyme (Merck-Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 37◦ C (Pangastuti et al., 2010) and 2 mg/mL proteinase K (Merck-Millipore) at 55◦ C (Sáenz De Rodrigáñez et al., 2009; Bakke et al., 2013).  Bacterial Community Profiling: 454 Pyrosequencing and Data Processing For bar-coded 454 pyrosequencing, a nested PCR approach was employed to enable standardized 16S rRNA gene amplification from all TC-DNA samples, including 2 DAH fish larvae which presented the lowest DNA yields 
 n the first PCR, c. 10 ng template DNA were used for the amplification of near full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes using 30 thermal cycles and the universal primer pair F27 (AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG)— R1492 (TACGGYTACCTTGTTACACTT) (Weisburg et al., 1991), as described elsewhere (Hardoim et al., 2012) 
 he resulting amplicons (2 µL) were used as template in a second PCR with the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) primer set (V4_titF-AYTGGGYDTAAAGNG and V4_titR-TACNVRRGTHTCTAATYC), which targets the V4 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, generating amplicons of around 248 bp in length

 f note was a striking decrease in rearing-water bacterial richness during the trial, with averages (± standard deviation) of 286.5 ± 55.45 vs. 134.75 ± 34.05 OTUs detected per sample at 2 DAH and 34 DAH, respectively (Holm-Sidak t = 5.982, P < 0.001) 
 s expected due to their high richness values, bacterial communities from 2 and 34 DAH tank water were the most susceptible to the removal of singleton OTUs (Table 1, Figure 2B), averaging 193.5 ± 41.16 and 97.25 ± 25.90 OTUs per sample, respectively (Figure 2B) 
 bserved and estimated (Chao1) richness measures when singleton OTUs are included (A) or excluded (B) are shown for size-normalized libraries (1,900 sequence reads per sample, the highest number of reads common to all samples), along with their respective Shannon diversity indices (C)

 rends revealed by community ordination remained unchanged when analyses were undertaken in the absence of singleton OTUs (Figure S1, Supplementary Material).  Specific and Shared OTUs across Microhabitats To determine how many and which OTUs were common or specific to each sample category, we explored the full (non-normalized) quality-filtered dataset using Venn diagrams where replicate samples per category were pooled (Figure 5)

 ortality rates in fish aquaculture during the first 30 days after egg hatching usually range from 80 to even 100% of the initial pool of hatched larvae (Uribe et al., 2011; Vadstein et al., 2013) 
 ater renewal rate ranged from 20 to 45% per h depending on the type of prey used for feeding (see below), draining through an 80 µm to a 500 µm mesh (Castanho, 2014) 
 nly live feed was provided to the larvae during the entire rearing period, which comprised 35 days from egg hatching to complete organs’ development 
 o determine the structure of bacterial communities added each day to the rearing tanks through the provision of feed organisms, three independent replicates of the live feed were sampled (prior to their introduction to the tanks), at random days during the rearing trial (depiction of live feed collection dates was simplified in Figure 1 for the sake of clarity) 
 he only exception to discrete clustering per microhabitat was one replicate from 2 DAH larvae (2L4), which first grouped with one cluster encompassing all rotifer replicates in the weighted cluster analysis (Figure 4B)

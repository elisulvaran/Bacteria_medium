iscussion Carbohydrate isomerases and epimerases have important functions in various carbohydrate metabolisms and are useful in industrial carbohydrate enzymatic conversions 
n this study Marme_2490 registered as an AGE in the sequence database and showing low sequence similarity with any known enzymes was shown to not epimerize N-acetyl-D-glucosamine but instead isomerizes Dmannose as the primary substrate 
o genes predicted to be involved in carbohydrate metabolism were present in the neighboring genes of Marme_2490 but the putative fructokinase genes JF50-16000 of P. luteoviolacea GenBank number KID55849.1 and RA12_07320 of X. fastidiosa GenBank number KIA58311.1 were present 
-Fructose produced was presumed to be phosphorylated by the fructokinase and metabolized through the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway 
he putative fructokinase gene Marme_4041 GenBank number ADZ93249.1 was also present in the M. mediterranea genome and thus Marme_2490 was likely involved in D-mannose metabolism together with the fructokinase 
n the kinetic analysis of D-mannose isomerization Table 2 Marme_2490 showed 2.9e113-fold higher kcat/Km than those of E. coli AKI EcAKI SeAKI , and TfMI , even though the kinetic analysis of Marme_2490 was conducted at a lower temperature 30  C than the compared enzymes 37e50  C 
mong these four enzymes the kcat/Km values of EcAKI and SeAKI for D-mannose were considerably low although Itoh et al . have reported that D-mannose was the best substrate of these enzymes among tested substrates 11 
ecently the isomerization activity of EcAKI to sulphoquinovose 6-deoxy-6sulphogulucose to 6-deoxy-6-sulphofructose was described 27 , and EcAKI might use sulphoquionvose as a better substrate than D- 70 W

I and AKI are distinguishable based on their isomerization activities for D-glucose AKI has a weak but apparent D-glucose isomerizing activity 11 , while MI does not 5,6,9 
arme_2490 possessed isomerization activity for D-lyxose as has been observed in other D-mannose-isomerizing enzymes such as MIs and AKIs 6,9,11 
he activity of MIs and AKIs to D-lyxose indicated that this interaction was not essential for catalysis 
n addition to isomerization activities to D-mannose and D-lyxose Marme_2490 isomerized 4-OH derivatives of D-mannose Dtalose and b- 1/4 -disaccharides 
somerization activity for these sugars was ﬁrst reported in Marme_2490 and is useful as a biocatalyst for carbohydrate conversions 
he structural basis for Marme_2490 's substrate speciﬁcity was addressed by comparing the structure of Marme_2490 in free form with SeAKI and RmCE 
n SeAKI the orientations of its a7/a8 and W 
alues are the average of three independent experiments and error bars show the standard deviation of the three values . a11/a12 loops are different in the substrate-free form and the complex with D-mannose Fig . 8A and B [ 11 
he241 in this loop is in close proximity to the 4-C 5-C and 6-C of D-mannose and is predicted to cause severe steric hindrance when the enzyme binds a disaccharide-substrate Fig . 8B 
onsistent with this prediction the a7/a8 loop of a disaccharide-acting CE is clearly shorter than in monosaccharide speciﬁc enzymes and contributes to the formation of an open substrate-binding site to accommodate disaccharide substrates Fig . 8C [ 15 
he Trp375 in this loop forms a hydrophobic interaction with the D-mannose 6-C and the Arg240 side chain in the a7/a8 loop Fig . 8B 
he a11/a12 loop of Marme_2490 was ordered even in the substrate-free form and assumed an open-orientation similar to that of RmCE Fig . 8C 
herefore the a7/a8 and a11/a12 loops of Marme_2490 were hypothesized not to interact with each other 
he entrance of Marme_2490 's active pocket in the substrate complex was presumably more open than SeAKI and the open substrate-binding site provided space for binding 4-OH derivatives of D-mannose 
he isomerization mechanism of Marme_2490 was examined and discussed by NMR analysis of the anomeric conﬁguration of Dmannose from D-fructose in the initial reaction and the presence of Fig . 8

he anomeric conﬁguration of the reaction product by Marme_2490 was consistent with ligands bound to SeAKI and RmCE 11,15 
s lactose and cellobiose in the formation of the complexes of wildtype RmCE are epimerized in crystals 15 , D-mannose residues in the RmCE complex are considered the product form 
arme_2490 presumably formed b-D-mannose through a ring closure process in a manner postulated for SeAKI and RmCE 11,15 
n NMR analysis of equilibrated reaction products the signals of protons at the D-mannose 2-C and D-fructose 1-C were clearly 72 W 
his was essentially different from the proton abstraction/addition mechanism postulated in CE and AGE 13,15 
I is thought to abstract the proton from 1-C of D-fructose to form the cis-enediolate intermediate and add the 2-C proton of the intermediate to produce D-mannose 
n D-fructose isomerization deprotonation of 1-O and protonation of 2-O are also required Fig . 1A , but their mechanisms remain unclear 
his His is invariant not only in AKI and MI but also in CE 
n Ruminococcus albus CE His184 has been shown to be essential for epimerization activity 14 and the His in the 6th a-helix is essential for catalysis of both the isomerase and epimerase reactions e.g. , stabilization of cis-enediolate intermediates through hydrogen-bonding interactions 
urther structural and functional analyses of AGE superfamily enzymes are necessary to understand the molecular basis for their reaction speciﬁcity

MR analysis of the reaction product generated from Dfructose in D2O The isomerization of D-fructose to D-mannose by Marme_2490 was monitored by 1H-NMR Fig . 4A 
uring the initial stage of the reaction the 1-H signal of b-D-mannose 4.92 ppm was higher than that of a-D-mannose 5.18 ppm , which is more abundant than b-D-mannose in the equilibrium aqueous solution of D-mannose . 68 W 
hus these protons were not substituted with deuterium from the reaction solvent upon isomerization . 3.4 
somerization of 10 mM D-mannose was monitored by measuring the concentration of D-fructose produced . This result suggests that Marme_2490 produced b-D-mannose from D-fructose 
he signal representing a-D-mannose increased at a later stage of the reaction . The structure of Marme_2490 was determined at 2.6 Å resolution Fig . 5A Table 3 
orrelation peaks of the methylene groups are shown in red . W 
he orientation of the side chain of His251 of Marme_2490 was similar to that of catalytic His248 of SeAKI in the apo-form indicating that His251 of Marme_2490 is the catalytic residue 
I a member of the AGE superfamily is an attractive enzyme that produces Dmannose from inexpensive D-fructose 
s D-xylose was also not isomerized by Marme_2490 the axial OH group at the D-aldose 2-C position was essential for the catalytic activity of Marme_2490 
he a7/a8 loop of SeAKI is distal from the substrate-binding site in the substrate-free form but is situated near the D-mannose substrate in the complex 
he SeAKI a11/a12 loop is disordered in the apo-form Fig . 8A , but is ordered when complexed with D-mannose Fig . 8B 
hese loops close the substrate-binding site entrance in the D-mannose complex 
he a7/a8 loop of Marme_2490 in the apo-form also adopted an open-form as has been observed in the apo-form of SeAKI Fig . 8A [ 11 
s this loop in molecule-A of Marme_2490 was disordered see above , this loop was hypothesized to be more ﬂexible than the same loop in SeAKI 
he a7/a8 loop of Marme_2490 contained Phe242 corresponding to SeAKI Phe241 but had a Leu241 at the corresponding position of SeAKI Arg240 
n addition the enzyme did not contain Trp corresponding to Trp375 of SeAKI 
fMI does not have Arg at the corresponding position of Arg240 of SeAKI Pro241 but has Trp375 corresponding to Trp375 of SeAKI 
n the initial reaction the signal of the b-D-mannose 1-H was more strongly detected than that of a-D-mannose generated indicating that Marme_2490 produce b-D-mannose from D-fructose 
radual formation of a-D-mannose observed in the later reaction was presumably because of nonenzymatic mutarotation 
aburi et al . / Biochimie 144 2018 63e73 detected which suggested that the proton abstracted from Dfructose was not substituted with deuterium from D2O solvent 
his mechanism in D-fructose isomerization was also postulated based on the structure of SeAKI 11

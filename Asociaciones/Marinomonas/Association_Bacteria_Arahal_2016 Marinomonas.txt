n Blanes Bay, north-western Mediterranean Sea, Gammaproteobacteria account for up to 8 % (and occasionally 50 %) of the total bacterial community as shown by catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (Alonso-Saez et al., 2007) 
s a result of the effort to characterize the culture collection of marine bacteria isolated at the Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory (Arahal et al., 2007; Pinhassi et al., 2007, 2009), a number of novel Gammaproteobacteria were also found

train MED121T was the only one in the assay that gave negative to all sources (except for the positive control plate) (Table 1) 
egarding the main quinone type, genomic information sustains the ability of strain MED121T to synthetize ubiquinone 8 (Q8), based on the presence of the gene coding for octaprenyl diphosphate synthase (E 2.5.1.90), but not enzymes able to synthesize larger quinone polyisoprenoids

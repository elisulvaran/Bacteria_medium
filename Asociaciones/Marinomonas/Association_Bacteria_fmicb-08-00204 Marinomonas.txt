arly- 2 days after hatching and late-stage 34 days after hatching fish larvae presented remarkably divergent bacterial consortia with the genera Pseudoalteromonas Marinomonas Acinetobacter and Acidocella besides several unclassified Alphaproteobacteria dominating the former and Actinobacillus Streptococcus Massilia Paracoccus and Pseudomonas being prevalent in the latter 
arvae sampled at 2 DAH were characterized by the genera Marinomonas Acinetobacter Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 February 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 204 Califano et al .

acterial communities from earlystage larvae 2 DAH displayed the highest level of variability in genus-level composition especially regarding the relative abundances of Pseudoalteromonas Marinomonas unclassified Alphaproteobacteria and GN02 Figure 3B . genus Loktanella OTU 1801 Table S1 whereas artemia nauplii showed high abundances of unclassified Flavobacteriaceae OTU 1902 Table S1 unclassified Rhodobacteraceae OTUs 85 and 708 , Table S1 and Paracoccus Alphaproteobacteria , OTU 2374 
his assemblage is primarily formed by typical free-living commensalistic or symbiotic marine bacteria e.g. Marinomonas Acidocella Pseudoalteromonas Rhodobacteraceae

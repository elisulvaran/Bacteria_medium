fter enzymatic desulfation the sulfate content decreased to about 0.16 % and gel strength increased about two folds 
 ata from GC–MS revealed that desulfation was carried out by the arylsulfatase at the sulfate bonds at C-4 and C-6 of d-galactose and C-6 of l-galactose with a desulfation ratio of 83.4 % and 86.0 % against GEAP and GRAP respectively . © 2016 Elsevier B.V 
 pplication of arylsulfatase in improving agar quality After enzymatic treatment the sulfate content of G. amansii agar remarkably decreased from 1.11 % to 0.16 % whereas that of G. lemaneiformis agar remarkably decreased from 1.52 % to 0.17 % 
 he sulfate contents of several commercial agarose products purchased from Sigma and Biowest were determined to range within 0.11 % to 0.17 % 
 esults indicated that the sulfate content of GEAP remarkably decreased from 7.4 % to 1.26 % with a desulfation ratio of 82.97 % and that of GRAP remarkably decreased from 8.48 % to 1.19 % with a desulfation ratio of 86.32 % . As shown in Figs . 5 and 6 the FT-IR peak of 1250 cm−1 attributed to the asymmetric stretching of sulfate ester group signiﬁcantly decreased after enzymatic treatment by arylsulfatase 
 im et al . 7 reported that after the treatment of agar by arylsulfatase from Sphingomonas sulfate content decreases from 3.9 % to 0.09 % whereas gel strength increases from 462 g cm−2 to 1128 g cm−2 
 n the present work GC–MS and FT-IR results showed that sulfate groups located at C-6 of ␣-l-galactose could be removed by arylsulfatase and parts of formed l-galactose were converted to 3,6-AG 
 he isolated agar 10 g was dissolved in 400 mL of 8.87 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt solution and stirred for 4 h at 60 ◦ C

 . amansii sulfated galactan with 7.4 % sulfated content was composed of galactose and 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose 
 eanwhile G. lemaneiformis sulfated galactan with 8.5 % sulfated content was composed of galactose 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose 2-O-methyl-3,6-anhydro-l-galactose and xylose 
 gar is generally considered to be a mixture of about 70 % agarose and 30 % sulfated galactan 2 
 solation of agar and sulfated galactan The dried tissue 20 g was autoclaved for 2 h at 121 ◦ C in 600 mL of distilled water 
 he water soluble fraction was separated from the residue by ﬁltration and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min 
 fter ﬁltration and concentration of the solution the sulfated galactan was precipitated with ethanol 1:3 v/v redissolved in distilled water dialyzed , and lyophilized 
 gar powder 5 g was suspended in 50 mL of 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer pH 9.0 and liqueﬁed at 121 ◦ C for 30 min 
 he gelling and melting temperatures were recorded with a precision thermometer 0.1 ◦ C divisions , in 1.0 % agar solution as previously described 14 
 he experiment was performed with 1.0 % of gel and 100–200 bp DNA ladder using a mini-sub cell GT 8 gel rigs Bio-Rad according to the method of Sambrook 15 
 ulfate content was measured by the turbidimetric method reported by Dodgson and Price 13 with some modiﬁcations after hydrolysis of the samples with 1 M HCl for 4 h at 105 ◦ C 
 n a typical procedure 4 mL of barium chloride-gelatin reagent was incubated with 1 mL of K2 SO4 solution at room temperature for 15 min with substrate concentrations of 0.03 0.06 0.12 0.18 0.24 and 0.30 mg/mL SO4 2− ion and then measured at 360 nm 
 he peak molar masses were estimated by gel-permeation chromatography using an Agilent 1260 instrument equipped with a differential refractometer detector in a TSK-gel GM PWXL column 7.8 mm × 30 cm at 35 ◦ C and a ﬂow rate of 0.5 mL/min 
 amples 20 mg were dissolved in 0.5 mL of D2 O and freeze dried twice to replace all exchangeable protons with deuterium . 13 C and 1 H NMR spectra of the polysaccharide were recorded at 35 ◦ C on a ProPulse NMR 500 MHz 
 tructure of enzymatic treated sulfated galactans Enzymatic desulfation was carried out by incubating sulfated galactan and arylsulfatase in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0 buffer at 45 ◦ C for 12 h

 he observed resonances were consistent with an alternating structure of the agaran type in the 13 C NMR spectrum Figs . 7b and 8b of both sulfated galactans whereas the absence of any anomeric signal below 98 ppm indicated the lack of 4-linked d-galactose residues 33

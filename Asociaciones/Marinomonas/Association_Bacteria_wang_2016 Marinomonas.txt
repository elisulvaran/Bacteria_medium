previously puriﬁed arylsulfatase from Marinomonas sp 
his study aimed to evaluate the potential application of arylsulfatase from Marinomonas sp 
he above results demonstrated that Marinomonas arylsulfatase was an efﬁcient catalyst for removing sulfate groups in sulfated galactans from G. lemaneiformis and G. amansii 
onclusion Superior to alkaline treatment arylsulfatase from Marinomonas sp

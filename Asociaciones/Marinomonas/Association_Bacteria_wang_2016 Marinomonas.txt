W-1 was used to remove sulfate groups in agar and sulfated galactans

n the agar industry, alkaline treatment is the traditional method of removing the primary sulfate groups of the galactopyranose unit by converting it to 3,6-anhydrogalactopyranose [4] 
ll rights reserved.  Arylsulfatase (aryl-sulfate sulfohydrolase; E.C.3.1.6.1) can catalyze the hydrolysis of arylsulfate esters to aryl compounds and inorganic sulfate 
ur previous study reported that after enzymatic treatment, the sulfate content of agar decreased, and the content of 3,6-anhydrogalactose increased 
n general, sulfate groups are found in some C-6 of the 4-linked ␣-l-galactose unit, the biogenic precursor of the 3,6-anhydro-␣-l-galactopyranose (LA) unit [10] 
he incorporation of sulfate groups into agar usually weakens gel strength because of the avoidance of a cross-linked structure during gelation [11] 
o obtain a relatively puriﬁed substrate for this enzyme, sulfated galactans with relatively high sulfate content were isolated from red seaweeds Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis and Gelidium amansii 
nzymatic desulfation of agar The arylsulfatase was used to degrade the sulfate groups of agar from G. amansii and G. lemaneiformis 
hysical properties of commercial agarose products and agar The physical properties like gel strength, melting and gelling temperatures, sulfate content and gel electrophoresis were evaluated in commercial agarose and agar from G. lemaneiformis and G. amansii before and after enzymatic treatment 
he sulfate content was determined by the turbidimetric method [13] 
pplication of arylsulfatase in improving agar quality After enzymatic treatment, the sulfate content of G. amansii agar remarkably decreased from 1.11% to 0.16%, whereas that of G. lemaneiformis agar remarkably decreased from 1.52% to 0.17% 
he sulfate contents of several commercial agarose products purchased from Sigma and Biowest were determined to range within 0.11% to 0.17% 
s shown in Table 1, the physical properties like gel strength and sulfate content of the enzymatic treated agar showed signiﬁcant differences as comparing with those of untreated agar 
he peak of 1250 cm−1 in FT-IR spectra was attributed to sulfate groups 
he results demonstrated that sulfate groups of G. lemaneiformis and G. amansii agar could be removed by aryl-  Fig. 3 
espite similar sulfate contents and molecular masses, the monosaccharide composition of GEAP was more complex than GRAP 
he absorbance band at 1250 cm−1 was attributed to the asymmetric stretching of the sulfate ester group [21,26] 
he position of the sulfate group of agar-type polysaccharide was identiﬁed by the bands at 800–850 cm−1 [29] 
everal references revealed that the bands at 850 and 830 cm−1 were attributed to the 4-O-sulfate and 2-O-sulfate groups, respectively, in d-galactose units, whereas the signals at 820 and 805 cm−1 were due to sulfate groups located at C-6 of d-galactose and at C-2 of 3,6-AG, respectively [21,25,27] 
EAP and GRAP did not show signals resolved at 805 cm−1 , indicating the absence of a sulfate group at C-2 of 3,6-AG. 3.3.2 
onversely, the amount of some derivatives related to sulfate groups such  as 1,4,5,6-Ac4 -2,3-Me2 -G, 1,3,4,5-Ac4 -2,6-Me2 -G, and 1,3,5,6Ac4 -2,4-Me2 -G decreased 
ence, sulfate groups of both sulfated galactans were situated at C-4 and C-6 positions of 3-linked d-galactose (G4S and G6S) and C-6 of 4-linked l-galactose (L6S) 
tructure analysis of desulfated galactan and desulfation mechanism by arylsulfatase After enzymatic treatment, sulfate content was measured by the turbidimetric method 
esults indicated that the sulfate content of GEAP remarkably decreased from 7.4% to 1.26% with a desulfation ratio of 82.97%, and that of GRAP remarkably decreased from 8.48% to 1.19% with a desulfation ratio of 86.32%.  As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the FT-IR peak of 1250 cm−1 attributed to the asymmetric stretching of sulfate ester group signiﬁcantly decreased after enzymatic treatment by arylsulfatase 
he absence of band at 850 cm−1 indicated that sulfate groups of galactose were eliminated 
he above results demonstrated that Marinomonas arylsulfatase was an efﬁcient catalyst for removing sulfate groups in sulfated galactans from G. lemaneiformis and G. amansii 
ethylation analysis of desulfation GRAP showed an increase in 1,3,5-Ac3 -2,4,6-Me3 -G together with a concomitant decrease in 1,3,4,5-Ac4 -2,6-Me2 -G and 1,3,5,6-Ac3 -2,4-Me2 -G, which suggested that the sulfate groups of G4S and G6S were removed by arylsulfatase 
urthermore, given the increase in 1,4,5,6-Ac4 -2,3-Me2 -G content in the premethylated product after desulfation, sulfate groups elimination of L6S were present 
lkaline treatment is a traditional method widely used in the agar-related industry to remove primary sulfate groups, especially at C-6 position of the galactopyranose unit and to consequently produce 3,6-anhydrogalactose derivatives [10] 
hukla et al. [34] reported that after the treatment of G. dura agar by sulfohydrolase, sulfate content decreased, whereas the amount of 3,6-anhydrogalactose was increased 
im et al. [7] reported that after the treatment of agar by arylsulfatase from Sphingomonas, sulfate content decreases from 3.9% to 0.09%, whereas gel strength increases from 462 g cm−2 to 1128 g cm−2  
n the present work, GC–MS and FT-IR results showed that sulfate groups located at C-6 of ␣-l-galactose could be removed by arylsulfatase, and parts of formed l-galactose were converted to 3,6-AG 
uperior to alkaline treatment, this arylsulfatase also showed excellent activity for removing sulfate groups located at C-4 and C-6 of d-galactose 
W-1 showed excellent activity for removing sulfate groups located at C-6 of ␣-l-galactose and at C-4 and C-6 of ␤-d-galactose insulfated galactans of the red seaweeds G. lemaneiformis and G. amansii 
he isolated agar (10 g) was dissolved in 400 mL of 8.87 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt solution and stirred for 4 h at 60 ◦ C

ntroduction Algae belonging to the red seaweed genera of Gracilariopsis and Gelidium are important resources in the agar industry [1] 
gar is generally considered to be a mixture of about 70% agarose and 30% sulfated galactan [2] 
garose can be used as an electrophoresis medium and a chromatographic resin, which are widely used in biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries 
oreover, the gel properties of agar enable its broad application as a gelling agent in processed foods and cosmetics products [3]

he observed resonances were consistent with an alternating structure of the agaran type in the 13 C NMR spectrum (Figs. 7b and 8b) of both sulfated galactans, whereas the absence of any anomeric signal below 98 ppm indicated the lack of 4-linked d-galactose residues [33]

onsidering the increase in 1,4,5-Ac3 -2,3,6-Me3 -G content after enzymatic treatment, not all L6S (3,6-AG precursor) were converted to 3,6-AG during enzymatic treatment 
esults of methylation analysis for GRAP were similar to those for GEAP, so the desulfation mechanism of arylsulfatase against agar of G. lemaneiformis was similar to that of G. amansii 
EM images signiﬁed that the enzymatic-desulfated agar was a morphologically distinct agar product with a much stronger network of ordered helical structure than the control agar 
fter sulfohydrolase reaction, the helical structure of agar cross-linked with one another to form a thick helix

olysaccharides were polydisperse, meaning that they generally did not have sharply deﬁned molecular weights, but rather average molecular weights representing a distribution of molecular species nearly identical in structure but varying in chain length [23] 
roup means were considered to be signiﬁcantly different at P < 0.05.  2 
hus, there is a growing need to develop eco-friendly processing technologies for recovery of products from bioresource 
MR spectroscopy NMR spectroscopy is a convenient method of obtaining valuable composition information on red seaweed polysaccharides [30] 
urthermore, enzymatic desulfation improved gel strength because its value increased from 190 g cm−2 to 470 g cm−2  
olysaccharide concentration was 1 mg/mL in 0.2 M NaCl solvent 
ulfate groups at C-6 or C-4 were stable in alkali [35]

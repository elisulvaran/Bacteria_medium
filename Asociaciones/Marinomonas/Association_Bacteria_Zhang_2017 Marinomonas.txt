he genus Marinomonas comprises the Gram-negative bacterial strains distributed in different marine environments and even in cold environments, such as deep-sea sediments [58,61] 
n this study, a higher abundance of the genus Marinomonas was observed in the gill of Austinograea sp., which suggests that gill surface-associated Marinomonas might be of interest for the production of enzymes for host metabolism [23]

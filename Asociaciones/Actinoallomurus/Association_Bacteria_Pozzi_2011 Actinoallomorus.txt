uring a program aimed at identifying previously unreported taxa of actinomycetes as potential source of novel compounds we isolated hundreds of different representatives of a new group initially designated as ‘ Alpha ’ and independently described as Actinoallomurus 
hese data suggest that Actinoallomurus strains possess several pathways for secondary metabolism and represent an attractive source in the search for novel antibiotics 
he results from a small pilot study suggest that the genus Actinoallomurus has the potential to produce metabolites arising from different biosynthetic pathways 
hylogenetic analysis of selected strains indicated they belong to the recently described genus Actinoallomurus within the Thermomonosporaceae.11 Furthermore on 16S rRNA analysis we were able to subdivide 115 strains in 32 ‘ Alp ’ 1KtedoGen Srl Milano Italy 2NAICONS Scrl Milano Italy 3ITB-CNR Segrate Italy and 4Vicuron Pharmaceuticals Gerenzano Italy Correspondence Dr S Donadio NAICONS Scrl Via Fantoli 16/15 20138 Milano Italy

hen we applied this method to soil samples about 25 % of soil DNA preparations yielded a band of the expected size,7 suggesting that Actinoallomurus strains may be quite cosmopolitan 
onsistently strains with an alpha-type morphology were isolated from many different soils and the PCR method proved an effective tool for rapidly assigning most of them to Actinoallomurus

ISCUSSION Strains belonging to the genus Actinoallomurus seem to be present in different environments as indicated by our isolation efforts and by screening soil DNA with our PCR method as well as by their retrieval from different sources including soils plants and dung by other groups.11,18–20 Furthermore our limited phylogenetic analysis indicates a discrete level of genotypic diversity 
ere we have also started to address the bioactive metabolites produced by Actinoallomurus strains 
rom three different Actinoallomurus strains we identified three unrelated compounds belonging to different chemical classes benanomicin coumermycin and N-butylbenzensulphonamide

or the other compounds identified in this study the benanomicin family of compounds requires the participation of a type II polyketide synthase followed by glycosylations and other post-polyketide modifications.22 Formation of coumermycin requires the tyrosine- and proline-derived aminocoumarin and 5-methyl-pyrrole-2-carboxyl moieties respectively as well as a The Journal of Antibiotics deoxysugar.23 Furthermore we previously reported the presence of type I polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes in Actinoallomurus strains,7 a property commonly found in many Actinobacteria genera,24 including recently described lineages.25 Thus at least some of the major pathways leading to bioactive compounds in filamentous actinomycetes are present in Actinoallomurus

CR primers for the specific amplification of the Actinoallomurus 16S rRNA gene were designed following a previously described procedure.29 Briefly aligned sequences obtained from Actinoallomurus strains were compared with the consensus sequences obtained for other genera and families of the Actinomycetales and conserved regions within the Actinoallomurus sequences were probed against the RDP database http //rdp.cme.msu.edu/ to discard aspecific primers 
he method was validated on a panel of genomic DNAs from Actinoallomurus strains and from negative controls strains belonging to other Actinobacteria genera including other Thermomonosporaceae 
he expected 0.34 kbp fragment was obtained only from strains whose 16S rRNA gene sequence clearly clustered within Actinoallomurus . Antimicrobial assays MeOH extracts of cultures were prepared as follows 450 ml of broth culture was shaken at 1400 r.p.m . with 900 ml MeOH for 1 h at 40 1C

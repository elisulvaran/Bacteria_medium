uring a program aimed at identifying previously unreported taxa of actinomycetes as potential source of novel compounds, we isolated hundreds of different representatives of a new group, initially designated as ‘Alpha’ and independently described as Actinoallomurus 
hese data suggest that Actinoallomurus strains possess several pathways for secondary metabolism and represent an attractive source in the search for novel antibiotics 
he results from a small pilot study suggest that the genus Actinoallomurus has the potential to produce metabolites arising from different biosynthetic pathways 
hylogenetic analysis of selected strains indicated they belong to the recently described genus Actinoallomurus within the Thermomonosporaceae.11 Furthermore, on 16S rRNA analysis, we were able to subdivide 115 strains in 32 ‘Alp’  1KtedoGen Srl, Milano, Italy; 2NAICONS Scrl, Milano, Italy; 3ITB-CNR, Segrate, Italy and 4Vicuron Pharmaceuticals, Gerenzano, Italy Correspondence: Dr S Donadio, NAICONS Scrl, Via Fantoli 16/15, 20138 Milano, Italy 
hen we applied this method to soil samples, about 25% of soil DNA preparations yielded a band of the expected size,7 suggesting that Actinoallomurus strains may be quite cosmopolitan 
onsistently, strains with an alpha-type morphology were isolated from many different soils, and the PCR method proved an effective tool for rapidly assigning most of them to Actinoallomurus 
o evaluate the ability of Actinoallomurus strains to produce bioactive compounds, we identified suitable growth conditions (see Methods)

ISCUSSION Strains belonging to the genus Actinoallomurus seem to be present in different environments, as indicated by our isolation efforts and by screening soil DNA with our PCR method, as well as by their retrieval from different sources, including soils, plants and dung, by other groups.11,18–20 Furthermore, our limited phylogenetic analysis indicates a discrete level of genotypic diversity 
ere, we have also started to address the bioactive metabolites produced by Actinoallomurus strains 
rom three different Actinoallomurus strains, we identified three unrelated compounds belonging to different chemical classes: benanomicin, coumermycin and N-butylbenzensulphonamide 
-butylbenzensulphonamide, an antifungal compound active against fungal plant pathogens, has been reported from a greenhouseassociated Pseudomonas strain13 and, very recently, from a terrestrial The Journal of Antibiotics  Actinoallomurus: source of bioactive metabolites R Pozzi et al 136  (I) HOOC (II)  NH  O HO O HO H3CO  O OH HO  OH O  O OH OH  (II) Dexylosyl benanomicin A  HOOC [MH+] 827  280  NH  O O  HO OH  H3CO  500  OH O  O O OH HO O O NH 2 OH HO HO  (I) Benanomicin B  Figure 3 Identification of active metabolites from strain K15.

or the other compounds identified in this study, the benanomicin family of compounds requires the participation of a type II polyketide synthase, followed by glycosylations and other post-polyketide modifications.22 Formation of coumermycin requires the tyrosine- and proline-derived aminocoumarin and 5-methyl-pyrrole-2-carboxyl moieties, respectively, as well as a The Journal of Antibiotics  deoxysugar.23 Furthermore, we previously reported the presence of type I polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes in Actinoallomurus strains,7 a property commonly found in many Actinobacteria genera,24 including recently described lineages.25 Thus, at least some of the major pathways leading to bioactive compounds in filamentous actinomycetes are present in Actinoallomurus

n some cases, their affiliation with the genus Actinoallomurus was  confirmed by phylotyping 
CR primers for the specific amplification of the Actinoallomurus 16S rRNA gene were designed following a previously described procedure.29 Briefly, aligned sequences obtained from Actinoallomurus strains were compared with the consensus sequences obtained for other genera and families of the Actinomycetales, and conserved regions within the Actinoallomurus sequences were probed against the RDP database (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/) to discard aspecific primers 
he method was validated on a panel of genomic DNAs from Actinoallomurus strains and from negative controls (strains belonging to other Actinobacteria genera, including other Thermomonosporaceae)

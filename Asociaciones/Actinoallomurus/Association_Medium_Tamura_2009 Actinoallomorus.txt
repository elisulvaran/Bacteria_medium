td 1-403 Yoshino-cho Kita-ku Saitama-shi Saitama 331-9530 Japan Ten actinomycete strains that form chains of spiral or looped spores were isolated from soil and dung samples in Japan 
hylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolated actinomycete strains consistently formed a monophyletic cluster with Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T and a separate line of descent in the phylogenetic cluster of the family Thermomonosporaceae 
ctinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T also contained D- and L-lysine in addition to meso-A2pm 
his genetic and phenotypic evidence revealed that the actinomycete strains could be clearly differentiated from the other members of the family Thermomonosporaceae and that they warranted separate genus status

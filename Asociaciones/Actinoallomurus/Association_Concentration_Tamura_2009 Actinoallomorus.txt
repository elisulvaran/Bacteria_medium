 ctinomadura spadix Nonomura and Ohara 1971 is known as a distinct species having low 16S rRNA gene similarity with the other species of the genus the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of the type strain 95.9 % is shown by the type strain of Actinomadura alba Wang et al. 2007 
 he 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolated strains formed a monophyletic cluster with Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T in which the branch was supported by a bootstrap value of 100 % Fig . 1 and Supplementary Fig 
 inary 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities among the isolates and Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T were not less than 96.7 % 
 trains TT02-47T TT02-22 and TT99-68 shared high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities ranging from 99.8 to 100 % 
 ll of the isolates and Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T showed similarity of 96.2 % or less with other Actinomadura strains such as the type strains of Actinomadura nitritigenes 96.2 % , Actinomadura echinospora 96.0 % , Actinomadura alba 95.9 % and Actinomadura fulvescens 95.8 %

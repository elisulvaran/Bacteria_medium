he 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the isolated strains formed a monophyletic cluster with Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T in which the branch was supported by a bootstrap value of 100 % (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig 
 inary 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities among the isolates and Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T were not less than 96.7 % 
 trains TT02-47T, TT02-22, and TT99-68 shared high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, ranging from 99.8 to 100 % 
 ll of the isolates and Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T showed similarity of 96.2 % or less with other Actinomadura strains, such as the type strains of Actinomadura nitritigenes (96.2 %), Actinomadura echinospora (96.0 %), Actinomadura alba (95.9 %) and Actinomadura fulvescens (95.8 %) 
 he isolates and Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T grew optimally at pH 5.5–6.0 
 he DNA–DNA relatedness among strains TT02-47T, TT02-22 and TT99-68 ranged from 61 to 90 % 
 n contrast, the relatedness among Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T and strains TTN02-30T, TT02-15T, TT0247T, TT04-09T, TTN02-22T, A3015T, TT00-28T and TT9966T ranged from 6 to 55 %

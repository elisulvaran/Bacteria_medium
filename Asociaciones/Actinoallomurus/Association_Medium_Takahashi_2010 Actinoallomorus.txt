he predominant menaquinones were MK-9 H6 and MK-9 H8 
he major fatty acids were iso-C16 0 and iso-C16 1 
he major phospholipids were phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol 
he significant differences in phenotypic and genotypic data indicate that strain GMKU 931T represents a novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus for which the name Actinoallomurus acaciae sp . nov. is proposed 
he isolation of novel endophytic actinomycetes is expected to lead to the identification of novel bioactive compounds and/or growth-regulating agents as well as novel actinomycete genera and species 
hailand is a natural-resource-rich country and there is a wide range of plant diversity 
herefore we have established a programme for the isolation and identification of endophytic actinomycetes from plants including those of important agricultural and medicinal species 
he GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain GMKU 931T is EU429322 . 554 The genus Actinoallomurus Tamura et al. 2009 is the most recently described genus in the family Thermomonosporaceae Kroppenstedt & Goodfellow 1991 Zhang et al. 1998 2001 which includes Actinocorallia Actinomadura Nonomura & Ohara 1971 , Excellospora , Spirillospora and Thermomonospora 
olyphasic investigation also revealed that Actinomadura spadix could be clearly distinguished at the genus level from other Actinomadura species and therefore the species was assigned to the genus Actinoallomurus as Actinoallomurus spadix comb . nov. Tamura et al. 2009 
t the same time other isolates from soil and dung samples collected from various places in Japan were chemotaxonomically and phylogenetically characterized and eight more novel species belonging to the genus Actinoallomurus were proposed Tamura et al. 2009 
dditionally the cell-wall peptidoglycan encloses D- and L-lysine which is an important characteristic to differentiate Actinoallomurus species from Actinomadura species Tamura et al. 2009 
he main menaquinones are MK-9 H6 and MK9 H8 
he root was surface sterilized with 95 % ethanol and 1 % sodium hypochlorite before being ground and spread onto starch-casein agar Küster & Williams 1964 supplemented with ml–1 100 mg ampicillin 2.5 U penicillin G and 20 mg ketoconazole 
he strain was isolated and purified on mannitol soya MS agar Hobbs et al. 1989 
he pure culture was maintained as a suspension in 20 % glycerol at –80 uC and as lyophilized cells for long-term preservation 
train GMKU 931T grew well on International Streptomyces Project ISP medium 2 Shirling & Gottlieb 1966 and MS agar at 30 uC and it started to produce whitish spores after 14 days 
oderate growth was observed on ISP 3 oatmeal-nitrate agar l–1 3.0 g Quaker white oat 0.2 g KNO3 0.5 g K2HPO4 0.2 g MgSO4 . 7H2O 15.0 g agar pH 7.0 and 1/10 yeast extract-starch agar poor growth was observed on ISP 5 and there was no growth on ISP 4 
orphological characteristics were examined by subculturing the strain on oatmeal-nitrate agar and observing under a light microscope and a scanning electron microscope JSM 5600 LV JEOL 
ydrolysis of casein and gelatin was evaluated using the media of Gordon et al . 1974 
ar 1 mm . showed activity for catalase and urease but not for oxidase 
mplification was carried out in a thermal cycler TaKaRa with an initial incubation step at 94 uC for 1 min 30 cycles of 94 uC for 1 min , 50 uC for 1 min and 72 uC for 1–5 min and a final extension step at 72 uC for 2 min 
he PCR product was purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit Qiagen and was sequenced directly on an ABI model 3130 automatic DNA sequencer using a BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit Applied Biosystems 
ultiple alignment of the sequences obtained from strain GMKU 931T and the type strains of the nine Actinoallomurus species with validly published names using Actinomadura madurae NBRC 14623T as an outgroup was performed using CLUSTAL X version 2 Larkin et al. 2007 
phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA version 4.0 Tamura et al. 2007 using the neighbour-joining method Saitou & Nei 1987 and the reliability of the tree topology was evaluated by bootstrap analysis with 1000 resamplings Felsenstein 1985 
hamchaipenet and others neighbours were Actinoallomurus caesius NBRC 103678T and Actinoallomurus amamiensis NBRC 103682T T Actinoallomurus fulvus NBRC 103680 with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 99.30 99.20 and 99.11 % respectively 
hole-cell amino acids and sugars were analysed using the method of Hasegawa et al . 1983 and Becker et al . 1965 , respectively 
hospholipids were extracted and determined by the method of Minnikin et al . 1984 
enaquinones were extracted and purified by using the method of Collins et al . 1977 and isoprene units were analysed by HPLC using a Jasco 802-SC chromatograph equipped with a Shiseido CAPCELL PAK C18 column as described by Tamaoka et al . 1983 
he sugars presented in whole-cell hydrolysates were galactose glucose madurose mannose and ribose 
hosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol were detected as the major phospholipids 
he major menaquinones were MK-9 H6 and MK-9 H8 , while a small amount of MK-9 H4 was also detected 
he predominant fatty acids were iso-C16 0 40.9 % and iso-C16 1 16 % 
he G+C content of the DNA of strain GMKU 931T was 70.6 mol % . There are a number of phenotypic differences between strain GMKU 931T and its closest phylogenetic neighbours Actinoallomurus caesius NBRC 103678T Actinoallomurus amamiensis NBRC 103682T and Actinoallomurus fulvus NBRC 103680T including differences in morphological characteristics optimal temperature for growth utilization of sole carbon sources degradation abilities and enzymic activities Table 1 
he significant characteristics that distinguish strain GMKU 931T from the other three strains are that strain GMKU 931T does not produce diffusible pigment on ISP 2 ISP 3 or yeast-starch agar does not grow on ISP 4 grows well at 28–30 uC does not utilize maltose raffinose or gelatin hydrolyses urea and exhibits aglucosidase activity when examined with the API ZYM enzyme assay 
o examine the finer taxonomic relationships between strain GMKU 931T and its three closest phylogenetic neighbours DNA–DNA hybridization relatedness values means of duplicate measurements were determined fluorometrically by the method of Ezaki et al . 1989 
he results supported the phenotypic and genotypic data and confirmed that strain GMKU 931T belongs to a different species low DNA–DNA relatedness values were found between strain GMKU 931T and Actinoallomurus caesius NBRC 103678T 44 % , Actinoallomurus amamiensis NBRC 103682T 43 % and Actinoallomurus fulvus NBRC 103680T 43 % 
train GMKU 931T is readily distinguished from its closest phylogenetic neighbours Actinoallomurus caesius Actinoallomurus amamiensis and Actinoallomurus fulvus on the basis of distinct phyletic lines differences in phenotypic data and low levels of DNA–DNA relatedness

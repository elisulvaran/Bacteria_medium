uring a program aimed at identifying previously unreported taxa of actinomycetes as potential source of novel compounds we isolated hundreds of different representatives of a new group initially designated as ‘ Alpha ’ and independently described as Actinoallomurus 
e report on a PCR-specific method for the detection of this taxon on appropriate growth conditions and on a pilot-screening program on 78 strains 
our strains were characterized in further detail one produced the aromatic polyketide benanomicin B and its dexylosyl derivative a second strain produced N-butylbenzenesulfonamide a third strain was an efficient converter of soymeal isoflavonoids from soymeal constituents and a fourth strain produced several coumermycin-related aminocoumarins with coumermycin A2 as the major peak and with some new congeners as minor components of the complex 
hese data suggest that Actinoallomurus strains possess several pathways for secondary metabolism and represent an attractive source in the search for novel antibiotics 
he Journal of Antibiotics 2011 64 133–139 doi:10.1038/ja.2010.149 published online 1 December 2010 Keywords actinomycetes screening secondary metabolites INTRODUCTION New antibiotics are urgently needed because of the increasing spread of resistant pathogens and the evolution of new diseases 
s microbial genomes synthetic libraries and high throughput screening have so far failed to produce a significant number of developmental candidates in the antibacterial field it is generally acknowledged that nature will continue to be a significant source of novel bioactive compounds,1 as confirmed by a recent survey of antibiotics under clinical development.2 However in a background of several thousands of known microbial metabolites it is necessary to introduce new strategies for accessing microbial strains to increase the probability of finding novel compounds 
hemical screening3 and more recently genome mining4 are alternatives to the traditional bioassay-guided screening 
n the latter case the probability of finding new compounds may be increased by the use of novel assays of novel microorganisms or by the mere size of the library to be screened.5 In any case dedicated efforts are providing novel metabolites.6 In the past years our attention has been drawn to previously uncultured actinomycetes under the assumption that strains belonging to novel taxa which are however phylogenetically related to prolific producers of secondary metabolites have a high chance of possessing diverse pathways in secondary metabolism and of affording novel compounds.7 A 16S-guided isolation program led to the identification of several new taxa,7 three of which have been subsequently formally described.8–10 During that program we were also able to isolate hundreds of different strains provisionally designated as ‘ Alpha ’ whose phylogenetic position suggested a new taxon within the Actinobacteria.7 Independently phylogenetically related strains have been assigned to the recently described genus Actinoallomurus.11 We present here a characterization of ‘ Alpha ’ strains present in our collections in terms of their potential to produce secondary metabolites 
hylogenetic analysis of selected strains indicated they belong to the recently described genus Actinoallomurus within the Thermomonosporaceae.11 Furthermore on 16S rRNA analysis we were able to subdivide 115 strains in 32 ‘ Alp ’ 1KtedoGen Srl Milano Italy 2NAICONS Scrl Milano Italy 3ITB-CNR Segrate Italy and 4Vicuron Pharmaceuticals Gerenzano Italy Correspondence Dr S Donadio NAICONS Scrl Via Fantoli 16/15 20138 Milano Italy

onsistently strains with an alpha-type morphology were isolated from many different soils and the PCR method proved an effective tool for rapidly assigning most of them to Actinoallomurus 
hese results prompted us to further investigate these strains and identify the bioactive metabolites produced 
train K15 Strain K15 produced an antifungal activity and a diffusible red pigment 
n all tested media it showed good growth and production of the red pigment and of the antifungal activity both of which could be efficiently recovered from the mycelium by MeOH extraction 
PLC fractionation of the MeOH extract followed by LC-MS of the active fractions led to the identification of two peaks eluting at 14.5 and 16.0 mins containing the major antifungal activity Figure 3 
hese peaks exhibited UV-VIS maxima at 500 nm and showed MH+ of 827 and 696 m/z respectively

his activity could be recovered from both the mycelium and the cleared broth 
thyl acetate extraction of the cleared fermentation broth HPLC fractionation and LC-MS analyses led to the identification of one peak eluting at 15.7 min containing the major antibiotic activity Figure 4 
C-MS analysis identified M+H + peaks with m/z values of 271 285 and 255 which matched the isoflavonoids genistein 7-O-methyl-genistein and daidzein respectively 
hese compounds which show antibacterial activity as well as different pharmacological effects in animal cells,14 have been reported before from actinomycetes,15 although it has been suggested that these metabolites derive from microbial hydrolysis of glycosidic plant isoflavonoids present in the culture medium rather than from de novo biosynthesis.16 Consistently HPLC analyses of organic extracts from strain K241 grown in INA5 medium containing 5 g l 1 instead of 15 g l 1 of soybean flour showed a corresponding decrease in the height of the genistein 7-O-methylgenistein and daidzein peaks which were absent altogether when soybean flour was omitted from INA5 or in a soybean flour-free medium such as RARE3 medium Figure 5 
rom a mycelium methanolic extract the HPLC fractions containing antistaphylococcal activity matched in their UV and MS properties Figure 6 with many congeners of the coumermycin complex.17 NMR analysis of the most active fraction confirmed the presence of coumermycin A2 m/z 1082 M+H + whereas we inferred the presence of coumermycins D1 C and D m/z values of 1096 989 and 908 M+H + , respectively by MS and MS/MS fragmentation 
s minor components of the complex we also identified potentially new coumermycin congeners showing m/z values of 1068 and 975 M+H + with fragmentation patterns similar to coumermycin A2 and C respectively 
he small amounts of these congeners amid large amounts of coumermycin A2 D1 C and D prevented us from carrying out their structural characterization 
ISCUSSION Strains belonging to the genus Actinoallomurus seem to be present in different environments as indicated by our isolation efforts and by screening soil DNA with our PCR method as well as by their retrieval from different sources including soils plants and dung by other groups.11,18–20 Furthermore our limited phylogenetic analysis indicates a discrete level of genotypic diversity 
rom three different Actinoallomurus strains we identified three unrelated compounds belonging to different chemical classes benanomicin coumermycin and N-butylbenzensulphonamide 
enanomicin- and coumermycin-related compounds have been reported as the products of Actinomadura or Streptomyces strains

or the other compounds identified in this study the benanomicin family of compounds requires the participation of a type II polyketide synthase followed by glycosylations and other post-polyketide modifications.22 Formation of coumermycin requires the tyrosine- and proline-derived aminocoumarin and 5-methyl-pyrrole-2-carboxyl moieties respectively as well as a The Journal of Antibiotics deoxysugar.23 Furthermore we previously reported the presence of type I polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes in Actinoallomurus strains,7 a property commonly found in many Actinobacteria genera,24 including recently described lineages.25 Thus at least some of the major pathways leading to bioactive compounds in filamentous actinomycetes are present in Actinoallomurus

ESULTS In the course of isolation programs aimed at identifying actinomycetes belonging to new taxa,7 we isolated from soil samples several actinomycete strains with branching aerial hyphae that as observed by light microscopy on agar plates differentiated into single spore chains along the aerial mycelium reminiscent of some Actinomadura strains 
ost of the strains were able to grow in the 30–37 1C temperature range at an optimal pH of 5.5 
or the rapid identification of novel isolates we developed an Actinoallomurus-specific PCR method see Methods 
hen we applied this method to soil samples about 25 % of soil DNA preparations yielded a band of the expected size,7 suggesting that Actinoallomurus strains may be quite cosmopolitan 
he Thermomonosporaceae family currently comprises five genera but to our knowledge only strains belonging to the genus Actinomadura have been reported to produce secondary metabolites 
o evaluate the ability of Actinoallomurus strains to produce bioactive compounds we identified suitable growth conditions see Methods 
bout 30 % of the tested strains showed at least an antimicrobial activity in our conditions Table 1 
ere we report the metabolites identified from four strains belonging to different phylotypes 
ne of the molecules present in this fraction showed a M+H + of 214 m/z 
earch in the ABL database suggested N-butylbenzenesulphonamide13 as the likely compound 
MR analysis confirmed this structure by comparison with the literature data 
he strain produced an antistaphylococcal activity which was observed in the mycelium from INA5-15 cultures despite a relatively poor growth in this medium 
nterestingly irrespective of the presence of isoflavonoids methanolic extracts still retained an activity against S. aureus which still awaits identification 
hus this genus appears to fulfill one requisite for being a valid source of bioactive compounds the possibility to access a significant number of strains with a reasonable degree of diversity 
ere we have also started to address the bioactive metabolites produced by Actinoallomurus strains 
espite the use of a limited number of culturing conditions our results indicate that about 30 % of the screened strains produce an antimicrobial activity against three test strains a fraction that favorably compares with other well-established genera of filamentous actinomycetes 
o our knowledge the biosynthesis of N-butylbenzensulphonamide has not been investigated

 phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain GMKU 370T formed a distinct clade within the genus Actinoallomurus 
hese chemical properties reveal that strain GMKU 370T belongs to the genus Actinoallomurus 
train GMKU 370T is distinct from the phylogenetically closely related type strains Actinoallomurus iriomotensis NBRC 103685T and Actinoallomurus coprocola NBRC 103688T (99.20 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to both) in terms of differences in phenotypic characteristics and DNA–DNA relatedness (51 and 17 %, respectively) 
t is proposed that strain GMKU 370T represents a novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus, for which the name Actinoallomurus oryzae sp. nov. is proposed 
n this work, an endophytic actinomycete was isolated from roots of a Thai jasmine rice plant and was found to represent a novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus 
he genus Actinoallomurus is characterized by cell walls that contain meso-diaminopimelic acid and lysine and 3Present address: Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Burapha University, Chonburi 20131, Thailand

ar, 1 mm. 738  370T (1468 bp) was preliminarily compared with 16S rRNA gene sequences in the GenBank database and this comparison indicated a close relationship with members of the genus Actinoallomurus (Tamura et al., 2009) 
ultiple alignment of sequences obtained from the 10 Actinoallomurus species with validly published names (Tamura et al., 2009; Thamchaipenet et al., 2010) and strain GMKU 370T (using the sequence of Actinomadura madurae NBRC 14623T as an outgroup) was performed using CLUSTAL_X, version 2 (Larkin et al., 2007) 
he result of the phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain GMKU 370T formed a clade with the members of the genus Actinoallomurus (Fig. 2) 
he closest phylogenetic neighbours were Actinoallomurus coprocola TT04-09T and Actinoallomurus iriomotensis TT02-47T, with 99.20 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to both type strains, corresponding to 11 nucleotide substitutions

DNA–DNA relatedness between A. coprocola NBRC 103688T and A. iriomotensis NBRC 103685T and strain GMKU 370T was 17 and 51 % (means of duplicate determinations), respectively 
he results of chemical analysis indicated that strain GMKU 370T has chemotaxonomic markers typical of members of the genus Actinoallomurus (Tamura et al., 2009) 
ased on the chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, it is confirmed that strain GMKU370T belongs to the genus Actinoallomurus 
t is therefore proposed that strain GMKU 370T represents a novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus, for which the name Actinoallomurus oryzae sp. nov. is proposed

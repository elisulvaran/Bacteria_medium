atalase and oxidase activities were determined with 3 % (v/v) hydrogen peroxide solution and 1 % tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine solution, respectively 
 he root was surface sterilized with 95 % ethanol and 1 % sodium hypochlorite before being ground and spread onto starch-casein agar (Küster & Williams, 1964) supplemented with (ml–1) 100 mg ampicillin, 2.5 U penicillin G and 20 mg ketoconazole 
 he pure culture was maintained as a suspension in 20 % glycerol at –80 uC and as lyophilized cells for long-term preservation 
 train GMKU 931T grew well on International Streptomyces Project (ISP) medium 2 (Shirling & Gottlieb, 1966) and MS agar at 30 uC and it started to produce whitish spores after 14 days 
 oderate growth was observed on ISP 3, oatmeal-nitrate agar (l–1: 3.0 g Quaker white oat, 0.2 g KNO3, 0.5 g K2HPO4, 0.2 g MgSO4 . 7H2O, 15.0 g agar; pH 7.0) and 1/10 yeast extract-starch agar, poor growth was observed on ISP 5 and there was no growth on ISP 4 
 mplification was carried out in a thermal cycler (TaKaRa), with an initial incubation step at 94 uC for 1 min, 30 cycles of 94 uC for 1 min, 50 uC for 1 min and 72 uC for 1–5 min and a final extension step at 72 uC for 2 min

 he optimal temperature for growth is 28– 30 uC and optimal pH is pH 6.0–7.0 
 rowth of strain GMKU 931T was determined over the temperature range 5–50 uC in a temperature-gradient incubator over 14 days on ISP 2 
 n ISP 2, the strain was able to tolerate NaCl up to 3 % (w/v); no growth was observed at 4 % NaCl 
 he biomass was obtained after incubation at 27 uC for 5 days in ISP 2 broth

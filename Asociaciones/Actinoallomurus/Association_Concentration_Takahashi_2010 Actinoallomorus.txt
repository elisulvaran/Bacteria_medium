he minor fatty acids were C16 0 4.3 % , 10-methyl C16 0 3.4 % , C17 0 3.8 % , anteiso-C17 0 5 % , 10-methyl C17 0 6.9 % , C18 0 4.6 % and 10methyl C18 0 tuberculostearic acid 3.3 % 
 atalase and oxidase activities were determined with 3 % v/v hydrogen peroxide solution and 1 % tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine solution respectively 
 he root was surface sterilized with 95 % ethanol and 1 % sodium hypochlorite before being ground and spread onto starch-casein agar Küster & Williams 1964 supplemented with ml–1 100 mg ampicillin 2.5 U penicillin G and 20 mg ketoconazole 
 he pure culture was maintained as a suspension in 20 % glycerol at –80 uC and as lyophilized cells for long-term preservation 
 train GMKU 931T grew well on International Streptomyces Project ISP medium 2 Shirling & Gottlieb 1966 and MS agar at 30 uC and it started to produce whitish spores after 14 days 
 oderate growth was observed on ISP 3 oatmeal-nitrate agar l–1 3.0 g Quaker white oat 0.2 g KNO3 0.5 g K2HPO4 0.2 g MgSO4 . 7H2O 15.0 g agar pH 7.0 and 1/10 yeast extract-starch agar poor growth was observed on ISP 5 and there was no growth on ISP 4 
 mplification was carried out in a thermal cycler TaKaRa with an initial incubation step at 94 uC for 1 min 30 cycles of 94 uC for 1 min , 50 uC for 1 min and 72 uC for 1–5 min and a final extension step at 72 uC for 2 min 
 hamchaipenet and others neighbours were Actinoallomurus caesius NBRC 103678T and Actinoallomurus amamiensis NBRC 103682T T Actinoallomurus fulvus NBRC 103680 with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values of 99.30 99.20 and 99.11 % respectively 
 he predominant fatty acids were iso-C16 0 40.9 % and iso-C16 1 16 % 
 he G+C content of the DNA of strain GMKU 931T was 70.6 mol % . There are a number of phenotypic differences between strain GMKU 931T and its closest phylogenetic neighbours Actinoallomurus caesius NBRC 103678T Actinoallomurus amamiensis NBRC 103682T and Actinoallomurus fulvus NBRC 103680T including differences in morphological characteristics optimal temperature for growth utilization of sole carbon sources degradation abilities and enzymic activities Table 1 
 he results supported the phenotypic and genotypic data and confirmed that strain GMKU 931T belongs to a different species low DNA–DNA relatedness values were found between strain GMKU 931T and Actinoallomurus caesius NBRC 103678T 44 % , Actinoallomurus amamiensis NBRC 103682T 43 % and Actinoallomurus fulvus NBRC 103680T 43 %

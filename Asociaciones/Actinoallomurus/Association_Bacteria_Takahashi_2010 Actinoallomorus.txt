 phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences suggested that strain GMKU 931T forms a distinct phyletic line within the recently proposed genus Actinoallomurus 
he significant differences in phenotypic and genotypic data indicate that strain GMKU 931T represents a novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus, for which the name Actinoallomurus acaciae sp. nov. is proposed 
he GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain GMKU 931T is EU429322.  554  The genus Actinoallomurus (Tamura et al., 2009) is the most recently described genus in the family Thermomonosporaceae (Kroppenstedt & Goodfellow, 1991; Zhang et al., 1998, 2001), which includes Actinocorallia, Actinomadura (Nonomura & Ohara, 1971), Excellospora, Spirillospora and Thermomonospora 
embers of the genus Actinoallomurus were found to be phylogenetically related to Actinomadura spadix, which exhibited low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with other Actinomadura species (Tamura et al., 2009) 
olyphasic investigation also revealed that Actinomadura spadix could be clearly distinguished at the genus level from other Actinomadura species and, therefore, the species was assigned to the genus Actinoallomurus as Actinoallomurus spadix comb. nov. (Tamura et al., 2009) 
t the same time, other isolates from soil and dung samples, collected from various places in Japan, were chemotaxonomically and phylogenetically characterized and eight more novel species belonging to the genus Actinoallomurus were proposed (Tamura et al., 2009)

dditionally, the cell-wall peptidoglycan encloses D- and L-lysine, which is an important characteristic to differentiate Actinoallomurus species from Actinomadura species (Tamura et al., 2009) 
n almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain GMKU 931T (1468 bp) was preliminarily compared with 16S rRNA gene sequences in the GenBank database, which indicated a close relationship with members of the genus Actinoallomurus (Tamura et al., 2009) 
ultiple alignment of the sequences obtained from strain GMKU 931T and the type strains of the nine Actinoallomurus species with validly published names, using Actinomadura madurae NBRC 14623T as an outgroup, was performed using CLUSTAL X version 2 (Larkin et al., 2007) 
he result of the phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain GMKU 931T formed a distinct clade within the genus Actinoallomurus (Fig. 2)

train GMKU 931T was analysed chemically using the methodology for the genus Actinoallomurus (Tamura et al., 2009) 
he G+C content of the DNA of strain GMKU 931T was 70.6 mol%.  There are a number of phenotypic differences between strain GMKU 931T and its closest phylogenetic neighbours, Actinoallomurus caesius NBRC 103678T, Actinoallomurus amamiensis NBRC 103682T and Actinoallomurus fulvus NBRC 103680T, including differences in morphological characteristics, optimal temperature for growth, utilization of sole carbon sources, degradation abilities and enzymic activities (Table 1) 
he results supported the phenotypic and genotypic data and confirmed that strain GMKU 931T belongs to a different species: low DNA–DNA relatedness values were found between strain GMKU 931T and Actinoallomurus caesius NBRC 103678T (44 %), Actinoallomurus amamiensis NBRC 103682T (43 %) and Actinoallomurus fulvus NBRC 103680T (43 %) 
n the basis of the data presented in this study, it is evident that strain GMKU 931T represents a distinct novel genomic species belonging to the genus Actinoallomurus 
train GMKU 931T is readily distinguished from its closest phylogenetic neighbours Actinoallomurus caesius, Actinoallomurus amamiensis and Actinoallomurus fulvus on the basis of distinct phyletic lines, differences in phenotypic data and low levels of DNA–DNA relatedness

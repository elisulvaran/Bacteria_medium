International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology (2012), 62, 295–298  DOI 10.1099/ijs.0.029181-0  Actinoallomurus radicium sp. nov., isolated from the roots of two plant species Atsuko Matsumoto, Asami Fukuda, Yuki Inahashi, Satoshi Ōmura and YŌko Takahashi Correspondence  Kitasato Institute for Life Sciences, Kitasato University, 5-9-1 Shirokane, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8641, Japan  Atsuko Matsumoto amatsu@lisci.kitasato-u.ac.jp  Three strains, K08-0182T, K08-0178 and K08-0195 were isolated from the paste of ground plant roots collected in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan 
aken together, these characteristics combined with 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses revealed that the isolated strains belong to the genus Actinoallomurus 
NA–DNA hybridization values showed that the three strains belonged to a novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus 
herefore strains K08-0182T, K08-0178 and K08-0195 are proposed as representatives of a novel species, Actinoallomurus radicium sp. nov 
n many trials we have used plant roots to isolate rare or novel actinomycete strains, and we reported the novel genus and species Phytohabitans suffuscus, which was isolated from an orchid variety (Inahashi et al., 2010), and Actinoallomurus acaciae (Thamchaipenet et al., 2010) and Actinoallomurus oryzae (Indananda et al., 2011) that were isolated from separate plants in Thailand 
he genus Actinoallomurus, the type species of which is Actinoallomurus spadix, was transferred from the genus Actinomadura based on a proposal by Tamura et al. (2009) 
ere we report the taxonomic characteristics of another novel species in the genus Actinoallomurus 
hylogenetic analysis using the neighbour-joining and maximum-likelihood methods showed that these strains are closely related to the genus Actinoallomurus (Fig. 1) 
t is clear that the strains belong to the genus Actinoallomurus based on the phylogenetic analyses and chemotaxonomic data 
he highest similarity value between the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the isolates and species of the genus Actinoallomurus was 99.0 % (Actinoallomurus iriomotensis TT02-47T), which was shown as the nearest species in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1)

ultural characteristics of strains K08-0182T, K08-0178, K08-0195 and Actinoallomurus iriomotensis NBRC 103685T All strains showed good growth, pale yellow colonies and no aerial mycelium on ISP 2 medium 
herefore, we propose to assign strains K08-0182T, K08-0178 and K08-0195 to a novel species of genus Actinoallomurus, Actinoallomurus radicium sp. nov.  Strains: 1, K08-0182T; 2, K08-0178; 3, K08-0195; 4, A. iriomotensis NBRC 103685T. +, Positive; 2, negative; +w, doubtful positive

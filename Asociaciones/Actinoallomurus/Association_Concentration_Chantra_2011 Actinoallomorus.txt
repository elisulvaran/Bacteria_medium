atalase and oxidase activities were determined with a 3 % v/v hydrogen peroxide solution and 1 % v/v tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine solution respectively 
 train GMKU 370T is distinct from the phylogenetically closely related type strains Actinoallomurus iriomotensis NBRC 103685T and Actinoallomurus coprocola NBRC 103688T 99.20 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to both in terms of differences in phenotypic characteristics and DNA–DNA relatedness 51 and 17 % respectively 
 xcised roots were surface-sterilized using serial treatments of 95 % v/v ethanol for 10 min 1 % w/v sodium hypochlorite for 15 min and 10 % w/v NaHCO3 for 10 min 
 he roots were then ground and spread onto starch casein agar SCA Küster & Williams 1964 supplemented with 2.5 U penicillin G ml21 and 50 mg cycloheximide ml21 
 ndananda and others at 30 uC for 4–5 weeks 
 fter incubation for 2 weeks at 27 uC moderate growth was observed on ISP 3 oatmeal-nitrate agar and YS agar 
 hitish aerial mycelium was produced on ISP 3 and oatmeal-nitrate agar after 3 weeks of growth 
 he closest phylogenetic neighbours were Actinoallomurus coprocola TT04-09T and Actinoallomurus iriomotensis TT02-47T with 99.20 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to both type strains corresponding to 11 nucleotide substitutions

DNA–DNA relatedness between A. coprocola NBRC 103688T and A. iriomotensis NBRC 103685T and strain GMKU 370T was 17 and 51 % means of duplicate determinations , respectively 
 o analyse the chemical characteristics of strain GMKU 370T biomass was prepared by growing the strain in 1 % w/v potato dextrose broth containing 1 % w/v yeast extract in an orbital shaker 200 r.p.m . at 27 uC for 14 days and then cells were freeze-dried 
 train GMKU 370T was able to grow at 21–45 uC with optimal growth at 32–39 uC at pH 5.0–9.0 and in 1–4 % NaCl 
 he optimal temperature and pH for growth are 32–39 uC and pH 5.0– 9.0 
 his study was supported by the Thailand Research Fund CHE and Kasetsart University Research and Development Institute . 740 Becker B. Lechevalier M 
 hus the results clearly indicated that strain GMKU 370T does not belong to either A. coprocola or A. iriomotensis as these values are well below the threshold value of 70 % suggested for the definition of bacterial species according to Wayne et al . 1987 
 he DNA G+C content of the type strain is 65.4 mol % . References The type strain strain GMKU 370T 5BCC 31373T 5NBRC 105246T was isolated from roots of a Thai jasmine rice plant Oryza sativa L. ‘ KDML 105 ’ collected from Pathum Thani Rice Research Center Pathum Thani province Thailand .

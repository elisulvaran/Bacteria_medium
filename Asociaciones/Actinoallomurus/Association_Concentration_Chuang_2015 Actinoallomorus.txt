 he major fatty acids were identified as iso-C16:0 32.8 % , C17:1x7c 14.2 % and anteisoC17:0 10.5 % ( Supplementary Table S2 
 ased on analysis using EzTaxon-e strain NEAU-TX1-15T was affiliated to the genus Actinoallomurus and to be closely related to A. yoronensis NBRC 103686T 99.2 % ; lower sequence similarities \99.0 % were found with the type strains of all other members of the genus Actinoallomurus with validly published names 
 he phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain NEAU-TX1-15T formed a distinct branch with its closest neighbour A. yoronensis NBRC 103686T supported by a bootstrap value of 96 % in the neighbour-joining tree Fig . 2 and also recovered with the maximum-likelihood algorithm Supplementary Fig

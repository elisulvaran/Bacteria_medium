 rowth at different temperatures (4, 10, 15, 20, 28, 37, 40 and 45 °C) was determined on ISP 3 medium after incubation for 21 days 
 he pH range for growth (pH 4–12, at intervals of 1 pH units) was tested in ISP 2 broth using the buffer system described by Xu et al. (2005), and NaCl tolerance was determined in ISP 2 broth supplemented with 1–7 % NaCl (w/v) at 28 °C for 21 days on a rotary shaker

 orphological, cultural and physiological characteristics Morphology properties were observed by light microscopy (Nikon ECLIPSE E200) and electron microscopy (Hitachi S-3400N) using cultures grown on ISP  123  Biomass for chemical studies was prepared by growing the strain in ISP 2 broth in Erlenmeyer flasks at 28 °C for 21 days 
 n Agilent G1321A fluorescence detector was used for peak detection with a 365 nm excitation and 455 nm longpass emission filters 
 enaquinones were extracted from freeze-dried biomass and purified according to Collins (1985).  Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2015) 108:453–459  Extracts were analysed by a HPLC–UV method using an Agilent Extend-C18 Column (150 9 4.6 mm, i.d. 5 lm), typically at 270 nm 
 he mobile phase was acetonitrile: iso-propyl alcohol (60:40, v/v) and the flow rate was set to 1.0 ml min-1 and the run time was 60 min 
 he concentration and purity of DNA samples were determined by measuring the optical density at 260, 280 and 230 nm 
 he growth of strain NEAU-TX1-15T was observed at 20–37 °C (optimum 28 °C), pH ranges 6–8 (optimum pH 7) and in the presence of 0–1 % NaCl (w/v) 
 he phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain NEAU-TX1-15T formed a distinct branch with its closest neighbour A. yoronensis NBRC 103686T, supported by a bootstrap value of 96 % in the neighbour-joining tree (Fig. 2) and also recovered with the maximum-likelihood algorithm (Supplementary Fig 
 owever, DNA–DNA relatedness between strain NEAU-TX1-15T and A. yoronensis NBRC 103686T revealed a value of 47.2 ± 0.4 %  123  (mean value of three hybridizations), which is well below the 70 % considered to be the threshold for assigning strains to the same prokaryotic species (Wayne et al. 1987) 
 ifferential characteristics include their clearly different colony colours after growth on ISP 3 and ISP 7 agar at 28 °C for 21 days (Supplementary Fig

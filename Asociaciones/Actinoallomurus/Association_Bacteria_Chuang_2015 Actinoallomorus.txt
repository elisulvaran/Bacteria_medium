orphological and chemotaxonomic properties of strain NEAU-TX1-15T are consistent with the description of the genus Actinoallomurus 
nalysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence supports the assignment of the novel strain to the genus Actinoallomurus, as it exhibits 99.2 % gene sequence similarity to that of Actinoallomurus yoronensis NBRC 103686T 
oreover, strain NEAU-TX1-15T could also be differentiated from A. yoronensis NBRC 103686T and other Actinoallomurus species showing high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity ([98.0 %) by cultural and physiological characteristics 
herefore, the combination of phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data, and the DNA–DNA hybridization value, indicated that strain NEAU-TX1-15T represents a novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus for which the name Actinoallomurus bryophytorum sp. nov. is proposed

iang State Key Laboratory for Biology of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests, Institute of Plant Protection, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing, People’s Republic of China  The genus Actinoallomurus was first proposed by Tamura et al. (2009), with Actinoallomurus spadix designated as the type species of the genus 
embers of the genus Actinoallomurus produce chains of  123  454  hooked or looped spores on aerial hyphae 
t the time of writing, the genus Actinoallomurus comprises 15 species with validly published names (http://www.bacterio.net/ actinoallomurus.html) 
n this study, we performed polyphasic taxonomy on this strain, and propose that strain NEAU-TX1-15T represents a new species of the genus Actinoallomurus, named Actinoallomurus bryophytorum sp. nov.  Materials and methods  Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2015) 108:453–459  3 agar at 28 °C for 5 weeks 
he type strain of Actinoallomurus yoronensis was purchased from NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC) and cultured under the same conditions for comparative analysis 
he experiments were performed with three replications and the DNA–DNA relatedness values were expressed as mean of the three values.  Results and discussion The morphological characteristics of strain NEAUTX1-15T are consistent with those of members of the genus Actinoallomurus 
t is evident that the chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain NEAU-TX1-15T also support its classification as a member of the genus Actinoallomurus 
ased on analysis using EzTaxon-e, strain NEAU-TX1-15T was affiliated to the genus Actinoallomurus and to be closely related to A. yoronensis NBRC 103686T (99.2 %); lower sequence similarities (\99.0 %) were found with the type strains of all other members of the genus Actinoallomurus with validly published names 
n addition, a comparative study between strain NEAU-TX1-15T and closely related type strains of the genus Actinoallomurus ([98.0 %) revealed that it differed from them in physiological and biochemical characteristics as summarised in Table 1 
n conclusion, it is evident from the genotypic and phenotypic data that strain NEAU-TX1-15T represents a novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus, for which the name Actinoallomurus bryophytorum sp. nov. is proposed.  Description of Actinoallomurus bryophytorum sp. nov

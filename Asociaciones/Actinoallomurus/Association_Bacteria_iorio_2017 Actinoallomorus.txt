elated compounds devoid of methyl group(s) and of antibacterial activity were isolated from a diﬀerent Actinoallomurus strain 
rom screening of about 200 Actinoallomurus strains, strains ID145113, -145206, and -145754 were identiﬁed as producers of related complexes with potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria as well as against a tolC mutant of Escherichia coli 
n the basis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences, the strains belong to three distinct, previously reported Actinoallomurus phylotypes.4,8 The active compounds were recovered by precipitation from a concentrated and acidiﬁed cleared broth of an ID145113 culture 
elated Metabolites from Other Actinoallomurus Strains 
s mentioned above, the three Actinoallomurus strains belong to three distinct phylotypes

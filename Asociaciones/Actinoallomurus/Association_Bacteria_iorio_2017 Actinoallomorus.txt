elated compounds devoid of methyl group s and of antibacterial activity were isolated from a diﬀerent Actinoallomurus strain 
rom screening of about 200 Actinoallomurus strains strains ID145113 -145206 and -145754 were identiﬁed as producers of related complexes with potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria as well as against a tolC mutant of Escherichia coli 
n the basis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences the strains belong to three distinct previously reported Actinoallomurus phylotypes.4,8 The active compounds were recovered by precipitation from a concentrated and acidiﬁed cleared broth of an ID145113 culture 
elated Metabolites from Other Actinoallomurus Strains 
s mentioned above the three Actinoallomurus strains belong to three distinct phylotypes 
nlocking the potential of novel taxa a study on Actinoallomurus 
ctinoallomurus ID145113 ID145206 and ID145754 were maintained on S1 5.5 plates.4 The strains were grown in shake-ﬂasks containing AF-A medium dextrose 10 g/L soybean meal 4 g/L yeast extract 1 g/L NaCl 0.5 g/L MES 1.5 g/L adjusted to pH 5.6 before sterilization for 240 h at 30 °C in a rotatory shaker at 200 rpm

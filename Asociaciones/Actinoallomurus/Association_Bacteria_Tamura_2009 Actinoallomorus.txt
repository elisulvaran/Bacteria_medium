e conclude that Actinomadura spadix should be assigned the status of the type species of a new genus as Actinoallomurus spadix gen. nov., comb. nov. (type strain NBRC 14099T 5ATCC 27298T 5BCRC 13386T 5CBS 261.72T 5CIP 105479T 5DSM 43459T 5JCM 3146T 5KCTC 9252T 5NCIMB 11118T 5NRRL B-16128T) 
urther, we conclude that the ten new isolates should be assigned to the novel species Actinoallomurus amamiensis sp. nov. (type strain TT00-28T 5NBRC 103682T 5KCTC 19537T), Actinoallomurus caesius sp. nov. (type strain A3015T 5NBRC 103678T 5KCTC 19535T), Actinoallomurus coprocola sp. nov. (type strain TT04-09T 5NBRC 103688T 5KCTC 19542T), Actinoallomurus fulvus sp. nov. (type strain TT9966T 5NBRC 103680T 5KCTC 19536T), Actinoallomurus iriomotensis sp. nov. (type strain TT02-47T 5NBRC 103685T 5KCTC 19539T), Actinoallomurus luridus sp. nov. (type strain TT0215T 5NBRC 103683T 5KCTC 19538T), Actinoallomurus purpureus sp. nov.

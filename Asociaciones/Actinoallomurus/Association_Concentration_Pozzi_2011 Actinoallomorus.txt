 our strains were characterized in further detail one produced the aromatic polyketide benanomicin B and its dexylosyl derivative a second strain produced N-butylbenzenesulfonamide a third strain was an efficient converter of soymeal isoflavonoids from soymeal constituents and a fourth strain produced several coumermycin-related aminocoumarins with coumermycin A2 as the major peak and with some new congeners as minor components of the complex 
 hese peaks exhibited UV-VIS maxima at 500 nm and showed MH+ of 827 and 696 m/z respectively 
 trains were grown in AF5.5 for 9 days and MeOH extracts from entire culture were analyzed as described under Methods with detector set at 230 nm 
 his was confirmed on a larger preparation of the 14.5-min fraction from the NMR signals at 6.9–7.27 and 3.2– 4.75 p.p.m. expected from aromatic and sugar protons respectively and by observing MS/MS fragmentations of m/z values of 695 550 and 461 expected from the loss of the first and the second sugar and the alanine residue respectively data not shown 
 thyl acetate extraction of the cleared fermentation broth HPLC fractionation and LC-MS analyses led to the identification of one peak eluting at 15.7 min containing the major antibiotic activity Figure 4 
 hese compounds which show antibacterial activity as well as different pharmacological effects in animal cells,14 have been reported before from actinomycetes,15 although it has been suggested that these metabolites derive from microbial hydrolysis of glycosidic plant isoflavonoids present in the culture medium rather than from de novo biosynthesis.16 Consistently HPLC analyses of organic extracts from strain K241 grown in INA5 medium containing 5 g l 1 instead of 15 g l 1 of soybean flour showed a corresponding decrease in the height of the genistein 7-O-methylgenistein and daidzein peaks which were absent altogether when soybean flour was omitted from INA5 or in a soybean flour-free medium such as RARE3 medium Figure 5

 ost of the strains were able to grow in the 30–37 1C temperature range at an optimal pH of 5.5 
 hen we applied this method to soil samples about 25 % of soil DNA preparations yielded a band of the expected size,7 suggesting that Actinoallomurus strains may be quite cosmopolitan 
 bout 30 % of the tested strains showed at least an antimicrobial activity in our conditions Table 1 
 espite the use of a limited number of culturing conditions our results indicate that about 30 % of the screened strains produce an antimicrobial activity against three test strains a fraction that favorably compares with other well-established genera of filamentous actinomycetes

 ultures were incubated at 28 uC and observations were recorded after 7 14 21 and 28 days 
 pecimens for electron microscopy were fixed in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde dehydrated critical-point dried and coated with gold as described by Lee & Jeong 2006 , before observation 
 tilization of sole carbon and nitrogen sources was examined on ISP medium 9 Shirling & Gottlieb 1966 including each ether-sterilized compound at a final concentration of 1 % w/v for sugars or 0.5 % w/v for amino acids 
 he Congo red solution was then poured off and plates were further treated by flooding with 1 M NaCl for 15 min 
 he visualized zones of hydrolysis could be stabilized for at least 2 weeks by flooding the agar with 1 M HCl which changes the dye colour to blue and inhibits further enzyme activity

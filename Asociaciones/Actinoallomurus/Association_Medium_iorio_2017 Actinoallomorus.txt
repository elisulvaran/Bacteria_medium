ashing the resulting pellet with acidiﬁed water and drying the residue aﬀorded a black powder that was practically insoluble in water, slightly soluble in organic solvents through the addition of a few drops of HCl or triﬂuoroacetic acid (yielding a yellow solution), soluble in DMSO, and highly soluble in alkaline aqueous solutions (resulting in a dark purple solution) 
he addition of triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) traces to the NMR sample can sometimes slow down tautomer interconversion and lead to sharp signals, as seen for fredericamycin A.10 However, this approach was ineﬀective in our case, so we resorted to the procedure employed for 820  DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b00654 J

ompounds 1 and 2 showed potent antibacterial activity with MIC values lower than 0.015 μg/mL against Grampositive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains 
ince compounds 1 and 2 were NMR-silent due to the presence of an oxygen radical, structure elucidation was achieved through a combination of derivatizations, oxidations, and analysis of 13Clabeled compounds 
he paramagnetoquinones share the same carbon scaﬀold as tetracenomycin but carry two quinones and a ﬁve-membered lactone fused to the aromatic system 
ompounds 2 and 1 are identical except for an unprecedented replacement of a methoxy in 2 by a methylamino group in 1 
elated compounds devoid of methyl group(s) and of antibacterial activity were isolated from a diﬀerent Actinoallomurus strain 
hile the cluster encodes many of the expected enzymes involved in the formation of aromatic polyketides, it also encodes a dedicated ketoacid dehydrogenase complex and an unusual acyl carrier protein transacylase, suggesting that an unusual starter unit might prime the polyketide synthase.  ■  T  he widespread use of antibacterial agents has led to the selection of resistant pathogens, which represents a serious threat to human well-being and health.1 This phenomenon is proceeding at a faster pace than our ability to develop safe and eﬀective antibiotics, due to the diﬃculty of identifying new chemical scaﬀolds as eﬀective starting points for novel therapeutics 
his latter challenge has been exacerbated by a decreased attention to microbial secondary metabolites, which cover a broad chemical space and have been selected through millions of years of evolution.2 However, the past successes at identifying bioactive molecules from microbial sources make it necessary to devise smart screens in order to identify new metabolites in a time- and resource-eﬀective endeavor.3 Screening underexplored taxa of microorganisms is a promising approach, since phylogenetic distance from highly explored microbial strains is expected to lead to novel chemistry 
n this respect, we have been focusing on strains belonging to the genus Actinoallomurus,4−7 a member of the Thermomonosporales suborder of Actinobacteria that was formally described in 2009.8 The presence of about 1000 such strains in the Naicons collection provides a reasonable number to assess the potential of this genus to yield novel chemistry and, possibly, interesting bioactivities.3 As part of this eﬀort, we describe herein the paramagnetoquinones 1 and 2 with potent antibacterial activity, together with related metabolites. © 2017 American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Discovery of Paramagnetoquinones 
rom screening of about 200 Actinoallomurus strains, strains ID145113, -145206, and -145754 were identiﬁed as producers of related complexes with potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria as well as against a tolC mutant of Escherichia coli 
he strains were isolated from soil samples collected in Corsica (France) and Campania and Emilia Romagna (Italy) 
n the basis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences, the strains belong to three distinct, previously reported Actinoallomurus phylotypes.4,8 The active compounds were recovered by precipitation from a concentrated and acidiﬁed cleared broth of an ID145113 culture 
PLC analysis showed two major peaks with retention times of 4.1 and 4.2 min (Figure 1, blue trace) in a 4:6 ratio 
he UV−vis spectra of 1 and 2 showed absorption maxima at 245, 280, and 455 nm and at 254, 275, and 455 nm, respectively 
rod. 2017, 80, 819−827  Journal of Natural Products  Article  kinobscurinone and stealthins,11 which required acetylation or methylation of the phenolic oxygens 
cid-catalyzed acetylation was thus performed on the 1/2 mixture, leading to the formation of a mixture of compounds whose m/z ratios were consistent with 1/2 carrying multiple acetyls and containing two additional hydrogens, suggesting reduction of a quinone moiety 
peciﬁcally, 1 and 2 incorporated up to four and three acetyls, respectively, with the most abundant molecule corresponding to the tri- and diacetyl derivatives of 1 and 2, respectively 
he acetylation mixtures were resolved by preparative TLC, and the puriﬁed compounds aﬀorded sharp NMR signals (Supplementary Figure S1) 
elected data are reported in Table 1, where Ac-2 corresponds to diacetyl-reduced-2 and Ac-1 corresponds to triacetyl-reduced-1 
n addition to the signals belonging to the introduced acetyls, whose positions were not investigated, the 1 H NMR spectrum of Ac-2 showed one phenolic proton (14.7 ppm), three aromatic singlets (8.26, 7.85, and 7.67 ppm), one methylene (5.85 ppm), and two methoxy signals (4.11 and 3.98 ppm) 
urther 2D experiments (Figures S2−S4, Supporting Information) highlighted a NOESY correlation between the aromatic CH at 7.85 ppm and the methoxy group at 4.11 
he HMBC correlations between the methyl groups at 3.98 and 4.11 ppm and the carbons at 147.2 and 158.4 ppm, respectively, revealed an aromatic nature for these methoxy groups 
MBC data also showed the presence of two unreduced quinone signals (δC 181 and 180.6) 
MR spectra of Ac-1 (Figures S5 and S6, Supporting Information) showed a similar pattern (see Table 1) except for the presence of a single methoxy (4.23 ppm) and of an additional methyl (3.25 ppm) whose δC at 36.1 is consistent with an aromatic methylamino group 
ompounds 1 and 2 showed diﬀerent stability in alkali 
n particular, while 1 was stable even at 60 °C for at least 168 h in 0.01 M NaOH, in this solvent 2 readily converted at room temperature into a more hydrophilic compound (tR 3.9 min and m/z 407 [M + H]+) 
n instability of a methoxy in ring E is expected given the negative mesomeric eﬀect brought about by the two quinone oxygens present in the adjacent ring D, which results in a better leaving group in comparison with a methylamino group.12−14 Altogether, the diﬀerent stabilities in alkali, the HR-MS data, and the NMR spectra suggested that the diﬀerence between 1 and 2 consists in the substitution of a methylamino with a methoxy 
hus, we resorted to oxidative cleavage of the quinone moiety(ies) performed on native and 13C-enriched 1 and 2, as detailed below 
n order to break the quinone system and thus eliminate the radical behavior,15,16 the 1/2 mixture was treated with 30% H2O2 in water (Scheme 1) 
ithin 1 h at room temperature, the starting dark purple solution turned yellow with the formation of a single, more hydrophilic molecule (compound 5) with an m/z of 399 [M + H]+ and UV absorptions at 230, 280, and 420 nm (Figure S7, Supporting Information) 
his result indicated that the oxidation had removed the portion responsible for the diﬀerence between 1 and 2 
emipuriﬁed extracts from strain ID145113 (blue and black) and ID145206 (red) 
R-MS analysis established their chemical formula as C22H14NO8 for 1 and C22H13O9 for 2 
n electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of the 1/2 mixture gave an intense signal with g = 2.0047 (data not shown), close to the value reported for fredericamycin A,10 kinobscurinone, and stealthin C11 and thus consistent with the presence of an oxygen radical

Scheme 1 
xidative Cleavage of Paramagnetoquinones  puriﬁed 5 was no longer paramagnetic and clear 1H NMR signals were observed (Table 2; Figure S8, Supporting Information): one broad phenolic signal (12.48 ppm), two aromatic protons at 8.14 and 7.81 ppm, one methylene signal at 5.73 ppm, and one methoxy group at 4.18 ppm 
verall, the MS data, the absence of one aromatic proton and of one methoxy group in 2 (or one methylamino in 1), are in agreement with a terminal quinone moiety oxidatively cleaved and replaced by two carboxylic acids as reported in the literature.15,16 Suﬃcient incorporation into paramagnetoquinones of 13Clabeled precursor(s) took some media design eﬀorts, since attempts failed in a minimal medium suitable for growth of and paramagnetoquinone production by strain ID145113 (see Experimental Section) 
eplacing soy ﬂour with glutamine and  reducing the yeast extract concentration to 0.5% (resulting in AF-N medium) led to satisfactory growth and paramagnetoquinone production of about 400 μg/mL after 8 days of cultivation 
MR analysis (HSQC, HMBC, together with 13 C, ADEQUATE, and INADEQUATE; Figures S9−S11, Supporting Information) of 13C-5 allowed detection of all nonprotonated carbons 
hree carbonyl signals at 166.7, 166.5, and 165.5 conﬁrmed the presence of the two oxidation-generated carboxylic acids, together with the carbonyl moiety that showed HMBC correlation with the CH2 group, as seen with the acetylated derivatives 
wo signals, at 187.4 and 181 ppm, evidenced the presence of an intact quinone not aﬀected by 821  DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b00654 J 
o activity (MIC > 16 μg/mL) of 1 and 2 was observed against the other tested Gram-negative strains (Table 3) or against Candida spp 
ompounds indistinguishable from 1 and 2 were also found in the fermentation broth of strain ID145754 (data not shown), as well as minor congeners in the fermentation broth of strain ID145206, which produced 3, with m/z 393 [M + H]+, as the main compound 
he structure of 3, which was also NMR silent, was elucidated following the same puriﬁcation and derivatization procedure applied to 1 and 2 
n this case, acetylation resulted in the formation of a tetra-acetyl-reduced derivative as the main product, with up to ﬁve added acetyls observed in the reaction mixture. 1H and 2D NMR experiments of the puriﬁed major acetylated compound (Figures S12 and S13, Supporting Information) evidenced the presence of one phenol (14.86 ppm), three aromatic protons (8.35, 8.14, and 7.34 ppm), and a CH2 (5.81 ppm), with the absence of methyl groups, apart from the acetyl-associated methyls 
cetylated 3 showed a longrange TOCSY correlation between the CH2 and one of the aromatic protons (δH 8.14, δC 122.1) 
2O2 oxidation at room temperature or at 60 °C converted 3 into more hydrophilic products with m/z 385 [M + H]+ or m/z 239 [M + H]+, respectively, consistent with compounds 8 and 9 in Scheme 1 
hus, the main metabolite from strain ID145206 corresponds to 2 lacking the two Omethyls in the B and E rings 
t should be noted that strain ID145206 also produced a lesser amount of the related compound 4, with m/z 406 [M + H]+, a similar UV−vis spectrum to 1, and which was stable in alkaline  oxidation and presumably internal to the remaining aromatic system 
he connectivity of the carbon atoms of the central core was assigned by INADEQUATE and 1,1-ADEQUATE experiments (Figure 2) 
ubstitutions at positions 3 and 11  Figure 2 
hemical structure of compound 5 with INADEQUATE (bold) and 1,1-ADEQUATE (arrows) correlations.  were thus clearly assigned to the methoxy and hydroxy groups, respectively, with the lactone ring conﬁrmed to be fused to the B ring at positions 2−13 
ubjecting 5 to stronger oxidation conditions (30% H2O2 at 60 °C for 14 h, Scheme 1) led to the formation of a more hydrophilic compound (tR 2.1 min; m/z of 253 [M + H]+; UV maxima at 220, 260, and 304 nm; Figure S7, Supporting Information), consistent with cleavage of the internal quinone moiety of 1 and 2 and formation of the compound shown in Scheme 1 
he mixture showed MIC values in the range 0.03−0.25 μg/mL against Enterococcus and Staphylococcus spp., with good activity also against all antibioticresistant strains tested 
ctivity was also seen against one fast-growing mycobacterium, the E. coli ΔtolC strain, and one Moraxella catarrhalis strain (MICs of 0.5, 1, and 0.03 μg/ mL, respectively) 
he mixture 1/2 was active against some anaerobic bacteria (Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacteroides fragilis, and Propionibacterium acnes; MICs of 0.5−1 μg/mL) but not 822  DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b00654 J

fter dissolution in CD3OD, NMR analysis showed sharp and clear signals, indicating that this metabolite was radical-free 
elected 1H and 13C NMR data are reported in Table 1 
urther signals included two aromatic protons (at 7.3 and 6.77 ppm) in meta position (J = 2 Hz) and one aromatic proton (7.53 ppm) as an isolated singlet 
 quinone moiety was revealed by the presence of an HMBC correlation between the proton at 7.53 and a carbon at 180.6 ppm 
 methoxy group at 3.95 ppm correlated in the HMBC with an aromatic carbon at 166.6 ppm and in the NOESY with the aromatic proton at 6.77 ppm 
 NOESY correlation was also visible between the signals at 7.53 and 2.80 ppm, the latter corresponding to one of the protons of C4, the methylene of the aliphatic ring directly connected to the aromatic rings 
verall, the combined LC-MS and NMR data are consistent with the structure of compound 7 as shown: 7 shares the same polyketide backbone as 1 and 2, but the terminal carboxyl group has been lost 
nterestingly, 7 has not yet undergone aromatization of ring B and, in contrast with 1 and 2, monooxygenation has occurred in the central ring.  conditions 
hus, strain ID145206 is producing a complex sharing the same scaﬀold as 1 and 2 but, under the investigated experimental conditions, is ineﬃcient at performing methylations 
verall, paramagnetoquinones share the same polyketide scaﬀold as tetracenomycins but with key diﬀerences, including two quinones, in rings C and E, instead of the single quinone in ring D, a ﬁve-membered lactone ring fused to ring B, and a paucity of postpolyketide oxidations 
 quinone in a methoxycarrying terminal ring is present in several metabolites with diﬀerent polyketide scaﬀolds (e.g., fredericamycin, polyketomycin, dutomycin, cervymycin, and bikaverin) 
ive-membered lactone rings can be found, in linear or angular positions, in some aromatic polyketides (e.g., austrocorticins, araliolactones, and allocyclinone) 
he presence of an N-methyl in an equivalent position has been reported for a naphthoquinone from Streptomyces, but no O-congeners were detected in that case.17 Despite the similarities to the tetracenomycin family, paramagnetoquinones show diﬀerent antimicrobial behavior with MIC values 3 orders of magnitude lower than tetracenomycins against both staphylococci and enterococci.18 A Likely Biosynthetic Intermediate

hese included the expected minimal PKS (NAI113_3498-_3500) for the synthesis of the decaketide precursor, two cyclases (NAI113_3493 and _3501), and one TcmG-like monooxygenase (NAI113_3508), likely responsible for introducing the oxygen at C-7.20 Surprisingly, while 1 and 2 each carries just two methyl groups, the pmq cluster encodes three methyltransferases: NAI113_3502, showing 51% identity to the elloramycin/tetracenomycin TcmN-type sequences and likely to be responsible for O-methylation at position 8,21 NAI113_3507, showing 45% identity to the polyketomycin methyltransferase PokMT2, predicted to be a C-methyltransferase,22 and NAI113_3509, closely related to PbtM4 (53% identity), involved in thiazole O-methylation in the thiopeptide GE227023 (see Table 4).  Nonetheless, 7 already carries the hydroxymethylene group, which results in the ring A in mature 1 and 2 
he pmq gene cluster encompasses a DNA region of about 27 kbp and consists of at least 10 transcription units (Figure 3) 
rod. 2017, 80, 819−827  Journal of Natural Products  Article  16S rRNA gene sequences were performed as previously described4,24 (deposited in GenBank with accession numbers KX533972, KX533973, and KX533974 respectively for strains ID145113, -145206, and -145754) 
 2 L culture of strain ID145113 was harvested and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to separate the mycelium from the clear broth 
he latter (about 1.8 L) was concentrated under vacuum to about 1 L and brought to pH 3.2 with 7.2 mL of 6 N HCl 
he suspension was kept overnight at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min, washed twice with 0.1 N HCl (5 mL), and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 48 h, yielding 595 mg of a black powder containing 1 and 2 
R-MS analysis established their chemical formula as C22H14NO8 for 1 (420.0714 found, 420.0719 calcd) and C22H13O9 for 2 (421.0557 found, 421.0559 calcd) 
fter centrifugation as above, the supernatant was extracted twice with 500 mL of ethyl acetate; then the organic phase was reduced to 200 mL and extracted twice with 100 mL of 0.05 N NaOH 
he aqueous phase was evaporated under reduced pressure, and about 2 mg of 7 was isolated as a purple powder 
cetylation, Oxidation, and Stability 
he reaction was quenched with the addition of 4 mL of H2O and extracted twice with 6 mL of ethyl acetate 
hese were separated by preparative TLC on silica gel to aﬀord the most abundant corresponding to the triacetyl derivative of 1 (3.9 mg) and the diacetyl derivative of 2 (4.8 mg) 
he 1/2 mixture (20 mg) was dissolved in 4 mL of 30% H2O2 and 2 mL of acetonitrile and kept under magnetic stirring for 24 h 
fter complete conversion of 1/2 into 5 (tR 3.6 min with m/z of 399 [M + H]+ and UV absorptions at 230, 280, and 420 nm), the reaction was quenched with the addition of 400 μL of 1 M sodium metabisulﬁte and concentrated under vacuum. 5 was puriﬁed using a CombiFlash RF Teledyne ISCO medium-pressure chromatography system on a 30 g Biotage SNAP Cartridge KP-C18-HS 
fter elution, the column was washed with 80% phase B (phase A was water with 0.1% TFA, and phase B was acetonitrile) 
ractions containing 5 were pooled and dried under reduced pressure, obtaining 6 mg of puriﬁed compound 
nlabeled 5 was also subjected to reaction with 30% H2O2 at 60 °C for 14 h, obtaining 6 (tR 2.4 min, m/z of 253 [M + H]+, UV absorption peaks at 220, 260, and 304 nm) 
he 1/2 mixture (1 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of 0.01 M NaOH, yielding a dark purple solution and monitored by LC-MS over time 
aramagnetoquinone A (1): purple powder; UV−vis (0.1% TFA/ acetonitrile, 3:7) λmax (log ε) 245 (5.25), 285 (5.30), 455 (4.79) nm; NMR silent; EPR data: g = 2.0047; ESI(+)MS m/z 420.1 [M + H]+;  While the pmq cluster does not encode any candidate for introducing the nitrogen atom at position 8, it does encode unusual features, namely, the three components of a biotindependent carboxylase (NAI113_3503-_3505) for generating the malonyl-CoA extender units, a PKS-related acyltransferase (NAI113_3487), presumably involved in charging the ACP with a starter/extender unit, and an apparently functional ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (NAI113_3490-_3492), presumably responsible for generating an acyl-CoA precursor 
hus, the pmq cluster appears to encode enzymes involved in the formation of two sets of CoA derivatives, one by carboxylation of acetylCoA and the other by decarboxylation of a ketoacid 
he presence of an acyl-CoA-generating system and of an acyltransferase within the pmq cluster are consistent with the possibility that a special polyketide unit is produced by the ketoacid dehydrogenase complex and charged onto the ACP by the acyltransferase NAI13_3487 
ince 1 and 2 contain a hydroxymethyl group at a place equivalent to the polyketide starter unit in tetracenomycin and since the hydroxymethyl is already present in the metabolite 7, it is possible that paramagnetoquinone biosynthesis utilizes a hydroxyacetylCoA as starter unit.  ■  EXPERIMENTAL SECTION  General Experimental Procedures

oreover, a carboxyl signal was detected (167.4 ppm) correlating in the HMBC with the methylene at δH 5.85 
his, in turn, showed a long-range TOCSY correlation with the aromatic CH at δH 7.67 
he 14 amu diﬀerence suggested that the O-methyl group of 2 was lost under these conditions 
owever, the paucity of protons together with the abundance of nonprotonated carbons prevented complete structure elucidation based on the above data 
he blue trace was obtained after precipitation of the cleared broth, while the black trace was from an EtOAc extract of the cleared broth (see Experimental Section).  chromic shift from 455 nm to 550 nm when the pH was raised above 7.0 
he 1/2 mixture showed the total absence of NMR signals, suggesting the presence of a free radical as previously reported for the so-called NMR-silent compounds.9 In these molecules, the presence of an extended aromatic system containing quinone moieties can lead to severe line-broadening of the NMR signals due to rapid interconversion of the numerous tautomeric forms 
e thus resorted to remove and/or replace individual components from the complex AF-A production medium in order to render it closer to a chemically deﬁned medium 
uriﬁcation as described above led to 45 mg of the 1/2 mixture, which was then treated with H2O2 to obtain 13C-labeled 5 
ompound 5 was devoid of detectable activity against the strains from Table 3 
s mentioned above, the three Actinoallomurus strains belong to three distinct phylotypes 
urprisingly, 3 was virtually devoid of activity against all tested strains, except for streptococci, for which the observed MICs were 3 orders of magnitude higher than those of the 1/2 mixture (see Table 3) 
hus, the methyl groups present in 1/2 are important for antibacterial activity 
he antibacterial activities of the mixture 1/2 are reported in Table 3 
gainst Streptococcus spp. the MICs were lower than 0.015 μg/mL 
y extracting the cleared broth with ethyl acetate, then back-extracting the organic phase with 0.05 M NaOH, about 2 mg of the purple compound 7 was isolated 
 clear aliphatic spin system evidenced the presence of a nonaromatic hydroxylated ring, carrying a hydroxymethylene 
oreover, one of the protons at C14 (at 3.72 ppm) correlated in the HMBC with a carbon at 133 ppm, which was the same carbon seen by the aromatic proton at 7.53 ppm, demonstrating that the aliphatic ring B was linearly fused with the aromatic ring C 
hese data are consistent with 4 being identical to 1, containing just one of the methyl groups 
owever, this feature was never reported for a tetracenomycin analogue, which only presented a methyl group at the 14-corresponding position, with some congeners carrying a carboxyl group at the 1- corresponding position 
he unique feature of paramagnetoquinones is the existence of two congeners, produced in equivalent amounts, which diﬀer for either an N-methyl or O-methyl group in ring E 
aving established that paramagnetoquinones share the same carbon scaﬀold with the tetracenomycin family, we further looked for related 823  DOI: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b00654 J

nder both conditions, 1 was stable, as was the 3/4 mixture (tested only at 60 °C) 
urprisingly, the acyltransferase NAI113_3487 is more related to the equivalent domains from type I PKSs from Proteobacteria than to actinomycete-derived PKSs (Table 4) 
ass spectrometry analysis was performed using the following sample inlet conditions: sheath gas (N2) 50 psi, dry gas 10 L/min, capillary heater 365 °C; sample inlet voltage settings: positive polarity, capillary voltage −4000 V, end plate oﬀset −500 V; scan conditions: maximum ion time 200 ms, ion time 5 ms, full microscan 3; segment: duration 10 min, scan events positive (100−2400 m/z) 
dentiﬁcation of biosynthetic gene clusters was performed using the Antismash v3.0.1 tool at the default conditions.25 BLAST analysis of individual CDSs was performed against the MIBiG database of known gene clusters.26 The sequence of the pmq cluster has been deposited with accession number KX533975

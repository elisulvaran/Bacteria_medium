 phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain 2614A723T formed a distinct phyletic line in the genus Actinoallomurus, the 16S rRNA gene tree sharing similarities of 98.35 %, 98.07 % and 97.86 % with Actinoallomurus spadix NBRC 14099T, Actinoallomurus purpureus TTN02-30T and Actinoallomurus luridus TT02-15T, respectively 
hese chemotaxonomic data confirmed the affiliation of strain 2614A723T to the genus Actinoallomurus 
t is apparent from the combined phenotypic data, biochemical tests and DNA–DNA hybridization values that strain 2614A723T should be classified in the genus Actinoallomurus as a representative of a novel species 
he name Actinoallomurus acanthiterrae sp. nov. is proposed with strain 2614A723T (5CCTCC AA 2012001T5DSM 45727T) as the type strain.  The genus Actinoallomurus was first established by Tamura et al.(2009) as a member of the family Thermomonosporaceae

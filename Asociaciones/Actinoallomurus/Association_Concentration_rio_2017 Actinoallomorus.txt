 n this case acetylation resulted in the formation of a tetra-acetyl-reduced derivative as the main product with up to ﬁve added acetyls observed in the reaction mixture . 1H and 2D NMR experiments of the puriﬁed major acetylated compound Figures S12 and S13 Supporting Information evidenced the presence of one phenol 14.86 ppm three aromatic protons 8.35 8.14 and 7.34 ppm , and a CH2 5.81 ppm , with the absence of methyl groups , apart from the acetyl-associated methyls 
 2O2 oxidation at room temperature or at 60 °C converted 3 into more hydrophilic products with m/z 385 M + H + or m/z 239 M + H + respectively consistent with compounds 8 and 9 in Scheme 1

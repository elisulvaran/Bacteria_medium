Scheme 1 
 xidative Cleavage of Paramagnetoquinones  puriﬁed 5 was no longer paramagnetic and clear 1H NMR signals were observed (Table 2; Figure S8, Supporting Information): one broad phenolic signal (12.48 ppm), two aromatic protons at 8.14 and 7.81 ppm, one methylene signal at 5.73 ppm, and one methoxy group at 4.18 ppm 
 eplacing soy ﬂour with glutamine and  reducing the yeast extract concentration to 0.5% (resulting in AF-N medium) led to satisfactory growth and paramagnetoquinone production of about 400 μg/mL after 8 days of cultivation 
  quinone moiety was revealed by the presence of an HMBC correlation between the proton at 7.53 and a carbon at 180.6 ppm

 SP medium 4 was used to examine starch hydrolysis, ISP medium 8 (0.5 % peptone, 0.3 % beef extract, 0.5 % KNO3, pH 7.0) for nitrate reduction, gelatin medium (2.0 % glucose, 0.5 % peptone, 20 % gelatin, pH 7.0) for gelatin liquefaction, 10 % skim milk (Difco) for coagulation and peptonization of milk, ISP medium 6 (DAIGO) for H2S production, and skim milk agar (Gordon et al., 1974) for casein hydrolysis 
 orphological characteristics of the aerial mycelium were observed by scanning electron microscopy (JSM-5600, JEOL) after incubation on ISP medium 4 (Difco) for 1 month at 27 uC and fixation with 4 % osmium tetroxide vapour 
 he roots were washed with sterilized water and dried in a chamber with silica gel for several days 
 fter soaking the roots in 70 % ethanol for 30 s and then in 1 % sodium hypochlorite for 30 s, the samples were rinsed in sterilized water before being ground in extraction solution (0.38 % K2HPO4, 0.12 % KH2PO4, 0.51 % MgSO4

 ultural and physiological characteristics were observed after incubation for 3 weeks at 27 uC 
 aCl tolerance, and pH and temperature ranges for growth were determined on ISP medium 2 
 he highest similarity value between the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the isolates and species of the genus Actinoallomurus was 99.0 % (Actinoallomurus iriomotensis TT02-47T), which was shown as the nearest species in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) 
 imilarity values between the three strains and other species were below 98.8 % 
 he isolates grew at temperatures ranging from 12 to 36 uC and at pH 5–7, but not on 2 % NaCl medium

 ifferential physiological characteristics of strains K08-0182T, K08-0178, K08-0195 and A. iriomotensis NBRC 103685T  DNA–DNA hybridization values were 77–100 % among the three isolates and 3–12 % between the isolates and A. iriomotensis TT02-47T (Supplementary Table S2) 
 rowth occurs at pH 5–7 and not with 2 % NaCl 
 tilization of sole carbon sources at 1 % (w/v) was tested using ISP medium 9 (DAIGO) as basal medium according to the method of Pridham & Gottlieb (1948) 
 he sequence similarity among the three strains was 100 % 
 he latter values are considered to be sufficiently below the 70 % threshold required for assigning strains to the same species (Wayne et al., 1987)

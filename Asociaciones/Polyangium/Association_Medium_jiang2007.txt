ntroduction Myxobacteria are Gram-negative gliding bacteria McCurdy 1989 whose cells grow cooperatively on a food source and can then form multi-cellular myxospore-containing fruiting bodies after exhaustion of the food supply Dworkin 1996 Shimkets 1990 
hey prefer to grow in the soil the dung of herbivores in bark and in rotting wood Dawid 2000 Reichenbach 1999 
ultivation strategies for myxobacteria usually involve incubation of natural samples on a selective agar-containing medium followed by cell swarming and fruiting body formation occasionally fruiting bodies themselves can be collected from nature Dawid 2000 Reichenbach and Dworkin 1992 
owever fruiting body formation is but one stage of their life cycle and these Corresponding author 
ll rights reserved . doi:10.1016/j.ympev.2007.04.004 structures often quickly collapse after their formation Reichenbach and Dworkin 1992 
s a result the distribution and diversity of myxobacteria in nature is still substantially unclear more than a century after they were ﬁrst described by Thaxter in 1892 
fter several updates the recognized myxobacteria are now classiﬁed into three suborders six families 17 genera and approximately 50 species Reichenbach 2004 Shimkets et al. 2005 
ompared to previous classiﬁcations McCurdy 1989 Reichenbach 1993 new myxobacterial taxa have recently been described either from new isolates reclassiﬁcation of misplaced taxa after phylogenetic analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences , or identiﬁcation of novel and distinguishing morphological characteristics 
or instance the present suborder Sorangineae contains six genera Haploangium now identiﬁed as Polyangium by Reichenbach in 2004 Chondromyces Polyangium , Sorangium and two new genera Byssophaga a cellulose-degrading myxobacterium 546 D.-M 
iang et al . / Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 44 2007 545–552 initially identiﬁed by Thaxter in 1897 and rediscovered by Reichenbach in 2004 and Jahnia Jahnia thaxteri previously termed Polyangium thaxteri 
or instance Sanford et al . 2002 isolated anaerobic myxobacteria strains from soil which were classiﬁed as members of the suborder Cystobacterineae based on their ability to grow using acetate as an electron donor and 2-chlorophenol as an electron acceptor 
hese and other unusual myxobacteria have broadened our understanding of the taxonomy of the group which has yet to be explored in detail 
n the one hand from the soil sample we were able to isolate only ﬁve Cystobacterineae strains two Myxococcus spp. two Corallococcus spp . and a Cystobacter sp . using classical isolation techniques in addition a Nannocystis sp . and a Sorangium sp . of the suborder Sorangineae were also identiﬁed 
y contrast cloning and sequencing 16S rRNA gene sequences from the same soil sample using myxobacteria-speciﬁc primers revealed that far greater diversity was present 
ifty-three Cystobacterineae-related clones were sequenced and could be divided into at least 12 subgroups with 95 % or less sequence similarity , of which four spanned the diversity of all previously described members of this suborder 
n the present study after a further molecular survey of the suborder Sorangineae in soil we carried out a detailed phylogenetic analysis of both cultured and uncultured myxobacteria 
ur data suggest that the myxobacteria exist in nature in two forms fruiting and nonfruiting types which probably correspond to cultured and uncultured myxobacteria 
he phylogenetic diversity molecular taxonomy and classiﬁcation of this interesting bacterial group is also discussed . 2 
aterials and methods 2.1 
rieﬂy the soil sample was ground with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen 
ollowing extraction with chloroform–isopentanol total DNA was precipitated with 0.6 vol of cold isopentanol washed with 70 % ice-cold ethanol and puriﬁed on a Sephedex G-200 column 
e designed speciﬁc primers Wu et al. 2005 for 16S rRNA genes of the suborders Cystobacterineae and Sorangineae to determine the diversity of myxobacteria in the environment 
embers of the Nannocystineae are more diverse in both 16S rDNA sequence content and fruiting body morphology Reichenbach 2004 
he primer set of Sorangineae speciﬁc W4 GTA AGA CAG AGG GTG CAA ACG T corresponding to positions 492–510 of the 16S rRNA in Escherichia coli Brosius et al. 1978 and bacterial universal Pr GGC TGG ATC ACC TCC TTT CT corresponding to the position of 1524–1541 bp was evaluated initially by using DNA from pure bacterial cultures as references 
t an annealing temperature of 69 C all the Sorangineae cultures were ampliﬁed whereas the Cystobacterineae strains and the negative controls E. coli and Methylobacterium sp . 0093-1 were not ampliﬁed 
. coli produced positive signals with the primer set at an annealing temperature lower than 64 C and Methylobacterium sp . 0093-1 at a temperature lower than 67 C 
he ampliﬁed products containing 16S rRNA gene sequences were puriﬁed using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit Qiagen USA and were ligated with pGEM-T easy Vector Promega USA following the protocols recommended by the manufacturer 
hey were electroporated into E. coli JM109 using the published procedure Sambrook and Russell 2001 . D.-M 
iang et al . / Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 44 2007 545–552 About 3000 white transformants were collected and stored as a Sorangineae-enriched 16S rRNA gene library . 2.2 
n situ colony hybridization and sequencing The oligonucleotide probe W5 GTA AGA CAG AGG GTG CAA ACG T corresponding to positions 529-550 of 16S rRNA in E. coli speciﬁc for the suborder Sorangineae was labeled at the 30 -end with ﬂuorescein-dUTP by terminal transferase in accordance with the manufacturer ’ s instructions for the Gene Image 30 -oligolabeling module Amersham Biosciences USA 
o evaluate and optimize conditions for in situ colony hybridization slot blot hybridization was performed with W5 
he membrane was soaked in the hybridization buﬀer 5· SSC 0.1 % w/v SDS 20-fold dilution of liquid block supplied with the kit and 0.5 % w/v dextran sulphate MW 500,000 ] for 1 h at a selected temperature 
fter hybridization the membrane was washed twice in 5· SSC 0.1 % w/v SDS at room temperature for 5 min each time and then washed twice in 1· SSC 0.1 % w/v SDS at 50 C for 15 min each time 
fter a complete alignment using clustalX version 1.83 Thompson et al. 1997 , corresponding parts of 16S rRNA gene sequences from cultured and uncultured myxobacteria were used for inferring phylogenetic relation- 547 ships 
hylogenetic relationships were also conﬁrmed by the likelihood and parsimony programs in the same software package 
esults and discussion 3.1 
mong the sequenced clones six fragments had no relationship to myxobacteria and were not studied further 
nterestingly and despite some morphological diversity sequences of all cultured Sorangineae were limited to a clade that included only 16 of the 74 Sorangineae-related sequences from soil 
hondromyces spp. Polyangium spp. Sorangium spp . and Byssophaga spp . Fig . 1 
mong the 33 uncultured sequences ﬁve clones 9-96 13-17 14-33 208 20-2 shared > 96 % similarity with the genus Sorangium four clones 9-15 13-73 16-60 21-42 were Polyangiumrelated seven clones 9-66 10-37 13-5 13-27 14-7 15-11 21-33 were Byssophage-related and the others were of unknown subgroups

phylogenetic tree inferred from clones of 16S rRNA gene sequences related to the Sorangineae and those from cultured myxobacteria in boldface

roups III and IV were composed of 4 and 13 clones respectively 5.4 % and 17.6 % , and the three clones in Group V represented 4.1 % of the total 74 sequences derived from soil 
his last group was distantly related less than 85 % sequence similarity to Group I and may represent a newly discovered suborder 
he number of cloned sequences aﬃliated with each group in Groups II–V was inversely proportional to the evolutionary distance between any one of them and Group I which may reﬂect the fact that the Sorangineae speciﬁc primer W4 and probe W5 were designed from the available sequenced data of the cultured Sorangineae strains which were after all only present in Group I . 3.2 
olecular taxonomy of cultured and uncultured myxobacteria An earlier phylogenetic analysis of 12 representative myxobacteria strains revealed three distinct clades Myxococcus Chondromyces and Nannocystis Shimkets and Woese 1992 
fter that time many myxobacteria strains with halophilic or slightly halophilic Iizuka et al. 1998 2003a b Fudou et al. 2002 halotolerant Li et al. 2002 Zhang et al. 2002a b psychrophilic Dawid , 2000 , and anaerobic Sanford et al. , 2002 characteristics have been discovered 
ig . 2a is a comprehensive phylogenetic tree inferred by using all the available cultured and uncultured myxobacteria 16S rRNA gene sequences 
lmost all cultured myxobacteria including the common and more unusual were found to members of one of the three clades which are now known as the three myxobacterial suborders Cystobacterineae Sorangineae and Nannocystineae Reichenbach 2004 
UST 6 and NU-2 the only two strains not included in the three suborders were described as salt-tolerant myxobacterial isolates but no further information is available Zhang et al. 2002a b 
he study by Stackebrandt and Päuker 2005 of 33 strains of Corallococcus coralloides isolated from 14 countries and ﬁve continents supported that the strains with this 549 type of fruiting body structure also had highly similar 16S rRNA gene sequences 
hus our study and that of Stackebrandt and Päuker 2005 suggest that shape and structure of the fruiting body is a good taxonomic character , although there are some exceptions 
lthough the suborder Nannocystineae was not explored a few uncultured Nannocystineae sequences discovered during our survey of the diversity of Cystobacterineae and Sorangineae were also characterized in this study 
omparing the phylogenies of the cultured and uncultured myxobacteria we can see that there are many uncultured myxobacteria in nature which are often signiﬁcantly distinct from the cultured myxobacteria in their 16S rRNA gene sequences 
ased on the tree topologies of the cultured and uncultured myxobacteria we suggest that the sequences recovered directly from soil by using a cultivation-independent approach cultured may represent myxobacteria which are incapable of forming fruiting bodies 
ince the ﬁrst report by Thaxter 1892 , myxobacteria have been isolated from many diﬀerent samples and places by many diﬀerent research groups 
ost recently obtained new isolates have been shown to be members of previously described genera not new and divergent taxa 
hat is to say the myxobacteria that have been isolated to date represent most of the fruiting myxobacteria which exist in nature and these have been used in the construction of the present myxobacterial taxonomy 
y carefully comparing the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the uncultured and cultured myxobacteria we can see that most of the sequences obtained directly from soil were not similar to those from cultivated taxa Fig . 1 Wu et al. 2005

orphogenesis of a fruiting body is a complicated developmental process which is genetically regulated and controlled 
hey may however still survive in nature together with their fruiting ancestors and thus form the basis for our sequences of uncultured myxobacteria 
he uncultured myxobacteria that have high sequence similarity to the cultured fruiting myxobacteria may be those cells that are deﬁcient in the formation of fruiting bodies whereas the uncultured myxobacteria that are distinctly diﬀerent from the cultured fruiting myxobacteria and located in unique phylogenetic linaeges may be those cells that are truly the non-fruiting myxobacteria 
ompared with the other members of the this division myxobacteria show complicated social behavior at least among those species that have been isolated and cultured 
he sociality of Myxococcus xanthus and particularly the ability to form fruiting bodies can rapidly degrade under asocial growth conditions Velicer et al. 1998 
elicer et al . 2002 suggested that there is a direct trade-oﬀ between competitive ﬁtness in one particular environment and the maintenance of a social trait 
he isolation and culture of the non-fruiting types myxobacteria would not only oﬀer the opportunity to conﬁrm our hypothesis but it would lead to a better understand of myxobacteria and their evolution

olecular systematic analyses also revealed that myxobacterial genera described to date on the basis of the morphology of multi-cellular fruiting bodies were mostly monophyletic 
owever these known taxa comprised only in a small part of the sequences recovered directly from soil in a cultivation-independent approach indicating that the group is much more diverse than previously thought 
ost of the uncultured myxobacteria may represent taxa which rarely form fruiting bodies or may lack some or all of the developmental genes needed for fruiting body formation 
he genus Nannocystis which had been placed in the suborder Sorangineae has now been elevated to form a new suborder Nannocystineae together with the halophilic or slightly halophilic myxobacterial strains that were recently isolated from Japanese coastal areas Iizuka et al. 1998 2003a b Fudou et al. 2002 as well as a newly renamed species Koﬂeria ﬂava previously Polyangium vitellinum Pl vt1 ( Reichenbach , 2004 
or example even when using conventional methods Watve et al . 1999 found that the number of myxobacteria in soil samples from India was probably several-fold higher than the number of samples typically recovered elsewhere 
e surmise that there may be many other bacteria within the myxobacterial clade that have yet to be discovered because they form fruiting bodies rarely or not at all 
n our previous work we explored the diversity of the myxobacterial suborder Cystobacterineae in soil by using both conventional isolation as well as cultivation-independent molecular phylogenetic methods Wu et al. 2005 
onstruction of a Sorangineae-enriched 16S rRNA gene library from a soil sample The total DNA surveyed for the construction of a Sorangineae-enriched 16S rRNA gene library was the same as that used in the surveying of uncultured Cystobacterineae sequences reported previously Wu et al. 2005 
y contrast it was not possible to design a primer set speciﬁc for 16S rRNA genes of members of the new suborder Nannocystineae only 19 entries in GenBank due to our inability to identify conserved sequence that was diagnostic for the group 
ccordingly the primer set W4/Pr was used to amplify Sorangineaeenriched 16S rRNA gene sequences from the soil community DNA using a touchdown PCR protocol Wu et al. 2005 to increase the diversity of Sorangineae products 
fter the addition of 5 ng/ml of labeled oligonucleotide probe the hybridization process was performed overnight 
hen the hybridization temperature was 61 C the 16S rRNA gene PCR products from Sorangineae strains produced obvious hybridization signals while there were no signals for Cystobacterineae strains E. coli or Methylobacterium sp . 0093-1 
hen the hybridization temperature was reduced to 58 C the Cystobacterineae strains produced weak signals while there were still no signals for E. coli or Methylobacterium sp . 0093-1 
o obtain maximum diversity the lower stringency hybridization temperature of 58 C was employed 
he Gene Image CDP-Star detection module Amersham Biosciences USA was used to detect the hybridization signal following the manufacture ’ s instruction 
ODAK X-OMAT AR XAR5 ﬁlms were exposed to the blots between intensifying screens for 1 h 
ighty-ﬁve positive clones were randomly selected for sequencing which was carried out in the Shanghai Sangon Sequencing Center Shanghai China 
fter BLAST analysis against the GenBank database the sequences that were related to the myxobacteria were sequenced from the other direction to obtain the sequence of the whole segment 
hylogenetic analysis For phylogenetic analyses the 16S rRNA gene sequences of all myxobacteria available in GenBank were extracted 
hylogenetic trees were inferred using the interior branch test of the Neighbor-Joining method in MEGA version 3.1 Kumar et al. 2004 
he bootstrapping supports for the trees were calculated from a sample of 1000 replicates 
he 16S rRNA gene sequence of the d-protoebacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans GenBank Accession No 
34113 , was used as an outgroup to root the tree . 3 
hylogenetic diversity of uncultured Sorangineae 16S rRNA gene sequences In situ colony hybridization was performed on more than 1000 clones of the Sorangineae-enriched 16S rRNA gene library 
pproximately 20 % of the samples produced a signal from which 85 clones were randomly chosen for sequencing 
eventyfour of the 77 unique myxobacteria-related clones belonged to the suborder Sorangineae Fig . 1 
he uncultured Sorangineae sequences in the campus garden soil exhibited a similar diversity to that of the uncultured Cystobacterineae described previously Wu et al. 2005 
ased on the phylogeny of the 74 unique Sorangineae sequences we suggest that this particular soil habitat contained at least ﬁve major clades of the suborder Sorangineae having 90 % or less sequence similarity with one another i.e. at the depth of separate families 
roup I contained 33 uncultured sequences accounting for 44.6 % of the total 74 sequences in two diﬀerent branches one of which included all of the reported cultured Sorangineae strains i.e 
here was no clone that was aﬃliated with the genus Chondromyces suggesting that members of this genus were probably not present in the campus garden soil 
he other four groups in the suborder Sorangineae were comprised exclusively of uncultured 548 D.-M 
epresentative reference taxa were chosen following the pruning of a much larger tree using all of the cultured Sorangineae sequences available in GenBank 
roup II was composed of 21 clones 28.4 % of the total 74 sequences with sequence similarity values of 89 to 98 % 
his group was more closely related to Group I than the other groups 
undreds of 16S rRNA gene sequences of cultured myxobacteria are now available in GenBank which enables detailed phylogenetic analyses of the myxobacteria 
he most signiﬁcant characteristic of the tree in Fig . 2a is that the cultured myxobacteria represent only a small portion of the group ’ s diversity with respect to 16S rRNA gene sequences 
espite this diversity most of the myxobacterial genera which were originally classiﬁed by their fruiting body morphology constituted monophyletic clades in this molecular systematic analysis 
he expansion of the tree in Fig . 2b illustrates the phylogenetic relationships of members of the genus Myxococcus 
or example the morphologically distinct genus Melittangium appears to be polyphyletic in that the 16S rRNA gene sequences of its diﬀerent members are 99 % or more similar to that of either Corallococcus or Cystobacter each of which is also polyphyletic in Fig . 2 
ven in the Mx-Fruiting group the Myxococcus-related sequences derived from soil were not only distributed in the cultured Myxococcus branches but also formed separate uncultured branches Fig . 2b 
he isolation techniques have been modiﬁed many times but all involved the collection and/or growth promotion of fruiting bodies 
t is therefore reasonable to suggest that the morphology-based isolation techniques have allowed the discovery of most types of the fruiting myxobacteria 
lternatively these myxobacteria might have been previously overlooked because their growth requirements were not met by the laboratory cultivation methods 
n fact we examined the soil sample about 0.5 g carefully under a dissecting microscope to establish if myxobacterial fruiting bodies existed but found no visible fruiting bodies 
ll of the available cultured myxobacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were used in this analysis 
he detailed construction of the Mx-Fruiting group is shown for demonstration 
ccording to Dawid ’ s studies on the isolation of myxobacteria from 1398 soil samples from 64 countries or states in all continents one to ten fruiting myxobacterial species can be found in a soil sample Dawid 2000 
eichenbach ’ s experiences in the recent decades also indicate that 0.5–1 g of the richest myxobacterial biota may yield 5–10 myxobacterial species deﬁned by their morphological characteristics Reichenbach 1993 
aken together with results of the current study it appears that some myxobacteria survive in nature without forming fruiting bodies . 2 
hylogenetic analysis of cultured myxobacteria indicates that the taxa described in part using fruiting body morphology are mostly monophyletic 
small change in the morphogenesis-related genes may result in deﬁciencies in fruiting body formation Guo et al. 1996 Lu et al. 2005 , which then renders the myxobacteria undetectable with classical isolation techniques 
he uncultured myxobacteria may be truly uncultivable or the optimum culture conditions have not yet been established 
s for the taxonomy of myxobacteria the isolated fruiting myxobacteria represent only a small fraction of the diversity of this phylogenetic group 
o isolate the uncultured but cultivable myxobacteria will require the development of new morphogenesis-independent isolation techniques . 3 
yxobacteria are phylogenetically placed in the d-division of the proteobacteria 
he phylogenetic analysis of the uncultured soil myxobacteria 16S rRNA gene sequences described in this paper not only supports the suggestions of Velicer et al . 1998 2002 , but also may indicate that the myxobacteria include non-fruiting types . 551 Our studies of uncultured myxobacteria in soil greatly expand the phylogenetic breadth of this group 
he appearance of the fruiting ability in myxobacteria is relatively recently derived trait that is found only in the myxobacteria 
hether fruiting body formation is an ancestral trait for the group that along with gliding motility deﬁnes the myxobacteria or whether it has evolved independently in diﬀerent clades is an interesting question that the current study has not resolved

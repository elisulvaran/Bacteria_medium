he ground soil was mixed with an extraction buﬀer 100 mM Tris–HCl 100 mM EDTA 100 mM sodium phosphate 1.5 M NaCl 1 % w/v CTAB pH 8.0 containing 1 mg/ml protease K and was then subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles followed by incubation at 65 C for 2 h 
 ifty-three Cystobacterineae-related clones were sequenced and could be divided into at least 12 subgroups with 95 % or less sequence similarity , of which four spanned the diversity of all previously described members of this suborder 
 ollowing extraction with chloroform–isopentanol total DNA was precipitated with 0.6 vol of cold isopentanol washed with 70 % ice-cold ethanol and puriﬁed on a Sephedex G-200 column 
 he membrane was soaked in the hybridization buﬀer 5· SSC 0.1 % w/v SDS 20-fold dilution of liquid block supplied with the kit and 0.5 % w/v dextran sulphate MW 500,000 ] for 1 h at a selected temperature 
 fter hybridization the membrane was washed twice in 5· SSC 0.1 % w/v SDS at room temperature for 5 min each time and then washed twice in 1· SSC 0.1 % w/v SDS at 50 C for 15 min each time 
 fter a complete alignment using clustalX version 1.83 Thompson et al. 1997 , corresponding parts of 16S rRNA gene sequences from cultured and uncultured myxobacteria were used for inferring phylogenetic relation- 547 ships 
 mong the 33 uncultured sequences ﬁve clones 9-96 13-17 14-33 208 20-2 shared > 96 % similarity with the genus Sorangium four clones 9-15 13-73 16-60 21-42 were Polyangiumrelated seven clones 9-66 10-37 13-5 13-27 14-7 15-11 21-33 were Byssophage-related and the others were of unknown subgroups 
 roups III and IV were composed of 4 and 13 clones respectively 5.4 % and 17.6 % , and the three clones in Group V represented 4.1 % of the total 74 sequences derived from soil 
 his last group was distantly related less than 85 % sequence similarity to Group I and may represent a newly discovered suborder 
 he bar in a is equivalent to two and in b to one nucleotide changes per 100 bp 
 pproximately 20 % of the samples produced a signal from which 85 clones were randomly chosen for sequencing 
 ased on the phylogeny of the 74 unique Sorangineae sequences we suggest that this particular soil habitat contained at least ﬁve major clades of the suborder Sorangineae having 90 % or less sequence similarity with one another i.e. at the depth of separate families 
 roup I contained 33 uncultured sequences accounting for 44.6 % of the total 74 sequences in two diﬀerent branches one of which included all of the reported cultured Sorangineae strains i.e 
 roup II was composed of 21 clones 28.4 % of the total 74 sequences with sequence similarity values of 89 to 98 % 
 or example the morphologically distinct genus Melittangium appears to be polyphyletic in that the 16S rRNA gene sequences of its diﬀerent members are 99 % or more similar to that of either Corallococcus or Cystobacter each of which is also polyphyletic in Fig . 2 
 he bar is equivalent to two nucleotide changes per 100 bp

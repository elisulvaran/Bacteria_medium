equences obtained were compared to the non-redundant nucleotide database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information by using their World Wide Website, and the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm. 1.5 Heavy metal tolerance of isolated strains To examine the ability of the isolate strains to resist heavy metals, cells of strains CD01, CD06 and CD08 were grown in 250-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 50 ml of LB medium supplemented with 500 mol/L of heavy metals (Cd in CdCl2 , Cr in K2 Cr2 O7 , Ni in NiSO4 , Zn in ZnSO4 , Pb in Pb(NO3 )2 , and Cu in CuSO4 ) 
 he concentration of heavy metals was 3 mg/kg for cadmium and 115 mg/kg for chromium 
 e also examined A. radioresistence ATCC15425 for its ability to resist cadmium and a much lower minimum inhibitory concentration was observed (500 µmol/L) compared to that of strain CD06 (1500 µmol/L)

(–) indicates a measured value less than 0.1 after 5-d incubation 
 he pH of the collected sample was 4.6 and the organic carbon content was 3.7% 
 oil (0.5 g) was inoculated into 250-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂask containing 50 ml medium and incubated at 30°C with shaking (150 r/min) to maintain aerobic conditions 
 CR conditions were as follows: 95°C for 5 min followed by ampliﬁcation in which the following conditions were used: denaturation at 95°C for 45 s, annealing at 55°C for 60 s and elongation for 90 s at 72°C with an additional 10 min at 72°C for each cycle for the 30 cycles 
 or pure cultures, cells were harvested and washed twice with 1 ml of sterile phosphate-buﬀered saline and the DNA was extracted from cell pellets by Triton-Prep method. 1.4 Ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analysis of the PCR products The 16S rDNA genes were ampliﬁed with bacterial  2 Results and discussion 2.1 Bacterial diversity determined by culture-independent 16S rDNA analysis From the selected clones with insertion of direct ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA from soil, seventeen diﬀerent microbial types (genera and/or species) were identiﬁed from 40 random selected clones 
 rowth after 24 h in the medium without heavy metal was 5.7 as measured by OD600 nm .  362  CHIEN Chihching et al.  Vol. 20  Fig. 1 Growth curves of strain CD06, CD08 and an Escherichia coli in the medium with and without the addition of heavy metals 
 ll the isolates showed robust-growth in the medium containing relative high concentration of heavy metals 
 ell growth was determined as measurements of optical density at 600 nm (OD600 nm )

he PCR products obtained from DNA extracted from soil were ﬁrst analyzed by electrophoresis in 1 % agarose gel and was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under short-wavelength UV light 
 equences obtained were compared to the non-redundant nucleotide database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information by using their World Wide Website and the BLAST Basic Local Alignment Search Tool algorithm . 1.5 Heavy metal tolerance of isolated strains To examine the ability of the isolate strains to resist heavy metals cells of strains CD01 CD06 and CD08 were grown in 250-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 50 ml of LB medium supplemented with 500 mol/L of heavy metals Cd in CdCl2 Cr in K2 Cr2 O7 Ni in NiSO4 Zn in ZnSO4 Pb in Pb NO3 2 and Cu in CuSO4 
 he concentration of heavy metals was 3 mg/kg for cadmium and 115 mg/kg for chromium 
 e also examined A. radioresistence ATCC15425 for its ability to resist cadmium and a much lower minimum inhibitory concentration was observed 500 µmol/L compared to that of strain CD06 1500 µmol/L 
 he pH of the collected sample was 4.6 and the organic carbon content was 3.7 % 
 he composition of the sample was 28 % sand 42 % silt and 30 % clay 
 oil 0.5 g was inoculated into 250-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂask containing 50 ml medium and incubated at 30°C with shaking 150 r/min to maintain aerobic conditions 
 CR conditions were as follows 95°C for 5 min followed by ampliﬁcation in which the following conditions were used denaturation at 95°C for 45 s annealing at 55°C for 60 s and elongation for 90 s at 72°C with an additional 10 min at 72°C for each cycle for the 30 cycles 
 or pure cultures cells were harvested and washed twice with 1 ml of sterile phosphate-buﬀered saline and the DNA was extracted from cell pellets by Triton-Prep method . 1.4 Ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA genes by polymerase chain reaction PCR and analysis of the PCR products The 16S rDNA genes were ampliﬁed with bacterial 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Bacterial diversity determined by culture-independent 16S rDNA analysis From the selected clones with insertion of direct ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA from soil seventeen diﬀerent microbial types genera and/or species were identiﬁed from 40 random selected clones 
 he results showed that compared to the heavy metal resistant strains E. coli did not grow in the medium containing Cd and Cr and also had remarkably reduced growth in the medium Table 1 List of the selected clones and their closest genera identiﬁed by 16S rDNA sequences Clone Most closely related strain by 16S rDNAa GenBank accession number MB-01 1 b MB-02 2 MB-03 4 MB-04 1 MB-06 1 MB 5-02 1 A-04 1 A-05 2 A-07 2 B-15 3 MB 36 3 MB 43 1 MB 49 12 MB 52 1 MB 56 2 MB 57 1 MB 67 2 α-Proteobacterium AB121772 c 96 % Hafnia alvei Z83203 98 % Uncultured bacterium CCM6b AY221067 97 % Variovorax paradoxus DQ256487 98 % Uncultured bacterium clone DQ537533 95 % Uncultured bacterium clone AF507681 92 % Polyangium cellulosum AF467674 96 % Uncultured Enterobacteriaceae AY635972 98 % Sphingomonas sp .

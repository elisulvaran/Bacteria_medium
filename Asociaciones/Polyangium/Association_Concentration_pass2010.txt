 he sediments were maintained in slurries in presence or absence of crude oil and the kinetic study was carried out 14 days 
 owever information on the early response within the first hours and days of a complex bacterial community to oil exposure is still scarce 
 aining insights into the bacterial abundance phylogenetic structure changes and degradation activity occurring in the first stage of oil contamination would be of great interest since it is hypothesised that the hydrocarbonoclastic populations are established within 2 weeks in the community related to fast biodegradation events 14 
 hus combining gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GC-MS analysis culture-dependant and molecular approaches terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism TRFLP , 16S rRNA gene and transcript libraries , the response of whole microbial community and its active members was screened throughout a slurry experiment during the first hours and days after crude oil input . 395 Materials and Methods Sediment Sampling The subsurface sediments 0–2 cm were collected from the station EDB1 43°29′05″N 5°11′17″E of the Berre brackish lagoon bordering the Mediterranean Sea on October 2005 24 
 lurry Set-up The sediment samples were homogenised through a 3 mm sieve and maintained for 4 weeks under daylight condition and at room temperature in order to remove low-molecular weight hydrocarbons boiling point c.a . 50 and < 200°C 
 riplicate microcosms were then set up in 100 ml sterile vial bottles containing 16 ml of the stabilised slurry and incubated for 2 days at room temperature in daylight prior oil addition

 ydrocarbon-growing Bacteria Enumeration Hydrocarbon-growing bacteria enumeration of the B−OIL and B+OIL microcosms was performed by the plate-count method in triplicates after 0 7 and 14 days 
 lates were prepared with washed agar 20 % and sterile synthetic seawater supplemented or not with hexadecane or naphthalene as sole carbon source 
 exadecane 750 μl was distributed on a sterilised filter paper placed in the Petri dish lid and in contact with agar surface to allow agar covering by capillarity 
 hirty colonies from 0 7 and 14 days enumeration plates were selected for their different morphology and isolated 
 olecular Analysis DNA and RNA Extraction Total genomic DNA extractions from the IS and the slurry microcosms were performed in triplicates at day 0 7 and 14 using the alternative lysis method of the UltraClean™ Soil DNA isolation kit MOBIO Laboratories Inc. USA 
 urified DNA was 397 suspended in 50 μl of sterile water and examined by agarose gel electrophoresis 
 otal RNA extraction of the slurry microcosms were performed in triplicates using the FastRNA Pro Soil-Direct kit Q-Biogen following manufacturer ’ s instructions after a first step of lysis three times for 1 min at 30 Hz in a bead beater TissueLyser Qiagen and without a matrix purification step 
 NA pellets were suspended in 100 μl sterile water and controlled on 1.2 % formaldehyde agarose gel

 he fluorescent PCR products were cleaned with GFX DNA and Gel Band Purification kit GE Healthcare and 100 ng of purified product digested separately with 3 U of enzyme HaeIII and HinfI in a final volume of 10 μl for 3 h at 37°C New England Biolabs 
 1 μl of restriction digests were then mixed with 20 μl of deionized formamide and 0.5 μl of a TAMRA labelled Genescan 500 bp internal size standard Applied Biosystems denatured for 5 min at 95°C , and immediately transferred to ice 
 equences with similarity over 97 % were considered to represent one phylotype and were grouped for statistical analysis 
 he most dominant hydrocarbon compounds were n-alkanes ranging from C10 to C20 constituting 90 % of the aliphatics and the 2- and 3-ring PAHs including naphthalene dibenzothiophene phenanthrene and their alkylated forms as well as fluorene and fluoranthene 88 % of PAHs for the aromatics 
 C-MS analysis of the B + OIL slurries revealed significant degradation of aliphatic F=7.548 p < 0.001 and aromatic F=57.488 p < 0.001 hydrocarbons after 14 days Fig . 1 
 he total extractable hydrocarbons were reduced to 69 % and 46 % of their initial amount after 7 and 14 days respectively 
 ukey 's multiple comparisons test showed that biodegradation of the aliphatics was however not significant between 7 and 14 days q=2.472 p > 0.05 
 t further showed that biodegradation of the aromatic hydrocarbons was significant between T0 and 14 days q=0.3683 p < 0.05 
 ore than 60 % of the most toxic PAH compounds including naphthalene fluorene fluoranthene and pyrene were degraded in 14 days Fig . 1

Discussion Heavily petroleum-contaminated sediment was chosen for this study since the community inhabiting these sediments is adapted to the presence of oil 24 and consequently its bacterial community presents more potential abilities than those from pristine environments to cope with oil hydrocarbons 
 hus this study reinforces the concept that important processes in response to oil contamination occur within few hours following an oil Table 1 Characteristics of the 0h B−OIL DNA and 0h B−OIL 9d B−OIL 9d B+OIL 12d B−OIL 12d B+OIL cDNA clone libraries Sample 0h B−OIL DNA 0h B−OIL cDNA 9d B−OIL cDNA 12d B−OIL cDNA 9d B+OIL cDNA 12d B+OIL cDNA a Singletons not sequenced Total no . of clones No . of taxa No . of singletons Coverage Shannon index 364 86 79 54 60 57 285 61 57 47 44 46 240a 46 46 41 36 37 0.34 0.45 0.42 0.24 0.36 0.35 5.511 3.946 3.838 3.800 3.625 3.757 402 S

 ollowing this first step of adaptation the communities were stable during 3 days 
 he two last clusters included the communities from day 12 to 14 cluster D was formed by communities from oiled microcosms while the cluster E contained the communities from unoiled microcosms 
 he RFLP analysis of the initial DNA community library revealed that 84 % of the clones analysed were singletons 
 n contrast the Gammaproteobacteria group reached 58 % of the active members of the oiled slurry at the end of the experiment while its abundance decreased significantly in the unoiled slurry Table 3

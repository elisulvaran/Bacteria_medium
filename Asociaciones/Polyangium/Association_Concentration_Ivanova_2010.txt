 NSDC databases indicate as of December 2009 that members of Haliangium are very rare in the environment with the most closely related The Genomic Standards Consortium Haliangium ochraceum type strain SMP-2T 16S rRNA gene sequences from uncultured bacteria being less than 94 % similar to H. ochraceum SMP-2T . Classification and features At the time of species description of the two Haliangium species the most similar 16S rRNA gene sequence from cultivated strains originated from strain Pl vt1T 
 he 16S rRNA gene sequences of the two Haliangium species were less than 94 % similar to this nearest neighbor 1 , and thus far no sequences of cultivated or uncultivated bacteria with higher similarities to SMP-2T were deposited in GenBank 
 heir second distinctive characteristic is their morphogenesis i.e . the formation of fruiting bodies and development of myxospores that is based on cell-to-cell signaling among the single cells of the population in a swarm 
 he myxospores tolerate heat treatment at 55-60°C for 5 minutes and storage in a desiccated stage for at least 3 months 23 
 he strain requires NaCl for growth with an optimum concentration of 2 % and good growth in the range of 0.5-4 % NaCl in agar or in liquid medium 1,2,23 
 dditional gene prediction analysis and functional annotation was performed within the Integrated Microbial Genomes Expert Review http //img.jgi.doe.gov/er platform 34 . Genome properties The genome is 9,446,314 bp long and comprises one main circular chromosome with a 69.5 % GC content Table 3 and Figure 3 
 second species of the genus Haliangium H. tepidum was described along with H. ochraceum 1

 he majority of the protein-coding genes 100 Haliangium ochraceum type strain SMP-2T ( 62.1 % were assigned with a putative function while the remaining ones were annotated as hypothetical proteins 
 he percentage of genes which were not assigned to COGs is relatively high 42 % a proportion similar to that in the ge- Table 2 
 search for PKS in different myxobacteria using PCR unfortunately did not include H. ochraceum but it included a strain representing the second species in the genus H. tepidum 40 
 he authors found the highest percentage of yet unde- scribed PKS sequences 50 % of all newly detected PKS sequences in the marine myxobacteria as compared to terrestrial myxobacteria

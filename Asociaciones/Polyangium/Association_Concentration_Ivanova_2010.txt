  Standards in Genomic Sciences  Ivanova et al.  summary of the project information is shown in Table 2.  Growth conditions and DNA isolation  H. ochraceum SMP-2T, DSM 14365, was grown in CY medium with seawater salts (in grams per liter: casitone 3.0, yeast extract 1.0, NaCl 21.1, KCl  0.6, CaCl2 × 2 H2O 1.2, MgCl2 × 6 H2O 3.6, NaHCO3 0.09, MgSO4 × 7H2O 2.6, agar 15 g) [26] at 28°C 
 heir second distinctive characteristic is their morphogenesis, i.e. the formation of fruiting bodies and development of myxospores, that is based on cell-to-cell signaling among the single cells of the population in a swarm 
 he myxospores tolerate heat treatment at 55-60°C for 5 minutes and storage in a desiccated stage for at least 3 months [23] 
 he strain requires NaCl for growth with an optimum concentration of 2% and good growth in the range of 0.5-4% NaCl in agar or in liquid medium [1,2,23] 
  second species of the genus Haliangium, H.  tepidum, was described along with H. ochraceum [1] 
 he branches are scaled in terms of the expected number of substitutions per site 
  search for PKS in different myxobacteria using PCR unfortunately did not include H. ochraceum but it included a strain representing the second species in the genus, H. tepidum [40]

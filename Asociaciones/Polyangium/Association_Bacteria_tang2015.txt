o better understand the glidobactin biosynthesis mechanism and to aid further studies of this strain we report the annotated complete genome sequence of DSM7029 which is 6,476,147 bp in length . © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. Polyangium brachysporum DSM 7029 =K481-B101 = ATCC 53,080 was ﬁrst isolated from a soil sample in Greece Oka et al. 1988 
hylogenetic analysis of the 16S ribosomal rRNA gene of strain DSM 7029 indicates that “ Polyangium brachysporum ” was misclassiﬁed and should be placed in the Burkholderiales Schellenberg et al. 2007

nhanced production of the minor components of glidobactins in Polyangium brachysporum 
train DSM 7029 can produce a novel type of antifungal and antitumor antibiotic complex, consisting of glidobactins Aâ€“C (Oka et al., 1988), which are hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetasepolyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) natural products, as proteasome inhibitors (Bian et al., 2014; Imker et al., 2010) 
here may be 14 putative gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of different natural products (Table 1)

umigel is a dark brown col loidal gel of potassium humate with pH 7.0, a density of 1.1 g/cm3, and a mass humate fraction of 5% 
 tepanov, and L 
 asoline AI95 at a concentration of 4% and Pb(CH3COO)2 at a concentration of 5MPC were applied as pollutants 
 al’tseva, and L 
 odel tests were per formed in vessels with a volume of 0.3 L to study the effect of the bacterial–humus preparations on the bio logical activity of the soils 
 n order to inhibit the development of fungi, 50 mg of nystatin was added for 0.5 L of the medium 
 he Pb(CH3COO)2 pollution decreased the catalase activity to a lesser degree than in the case with the gasoline pol lution.  402  KOZLOVA et al. billion cell/g soil 4.5 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0  G + HA +MC  G + MC  G + HA + BS  G + BS  G + HA  G  Pb + HA + MC  Pb + MC  Pb + HA + BS  Pb + BS  Pb + HA  Pb  HA + MC  MC  HA + BS  BS  HA  0  C  0.5  mg TPhF/10 g 24 h  (c)  14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0  (b)  (d)  C HA BS HA + BS MC HA + MC Pb Pb + HA Pb + BS Pb + HA + BS Pb + MC Pb + HA + MC G G + HA G + BS G + HA + BS G + MC G + HA +MC  45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0  (a)  mg P2O5/10 g soil h  7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  C HA BS HA + BS MC HA + MC Pb Pb + HA Pb + BS Pb + HA + BS Pb + MC Pb + HA + MC G G + HA G + BS G + HA + BS G + MC G + HA +MC  mL NH3/10 g 4 h  mL О2/ g min  Fig. 1

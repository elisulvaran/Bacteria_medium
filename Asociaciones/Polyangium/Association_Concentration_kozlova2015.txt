umigel is a dark brown col loidal gel of potassium humate with pH 7.0 a density of 1.1 g/cm3 and a mass humate fraction of 5 % 
 tepanov and L 
 asoline AI95 at a concentration of 4 % and Pb CH3COO 2 at a concentration of 5MPC were applied as pollutants

 hanges in the share of Bacillus a , Pseudomo nas b , and Rhodococcus c bacteria in the structure of the saprotroph bacterial complex . the genera studied was used for the characterization of the saprotrophic bacterial complex structure accord ing to the following gradations dominants—more than 30 % of the total number of bacteria counted on the applied medium subdominants—20–30 % the group of medium abundance—10–20 % and the minor components—less than 10 % 
 he introduction of bacterial suspensions to the soil increased the share of Pseudomonas bacteria up to 0.9 and 2.0 % in the pure Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas cultures and in the soil microbial com plex respectively 
 al ’ tseva and L 
 odel tests were per formed in vessels with a volume of 0.3 L to study the effect of the bacterial–humus preparations on the bio logical activity of the soils 
 n order to inhibit the development of fungi 50 mg of nystatin was added for 0.5 L of the medium 
 he 4 % gas oline pollution of the soil has led to a reduction in the total bacterial number by 3 times Fig . 1 
 he intro duction of the bacterial–humus preparations to the polluted soil promoted the increase in the number of soil bacteria by 70 % 
 he application of bacterial–humus prepa rations increased the catalase activity by 60–80 % 
 he Pb CH3COO 2 pollution decreased the catalase activity to a lesser degree than in the case with the gasoline pol lution . 402 KOZLOVA et al . billion cell/g soil 4.5 4.0 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 G + HA +MC G + MC G + HA + BS G + BS G + HA G Pb + HA + MC Pb + MC Pb + HA + BS Pb + BS Pb + HA Pb HA + MC MC HA + BS BS HA 0 C 0.5 mg TPhF/10 g 24 h c 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 b d C HA BS HA + BS MC HA + MC Pb Pb + HA Pb + BS Pb + HA + BS Pb + MC Pb + HA + MC G G + HA G + BS G + HA + BS G + MC G + HA +MC 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 ( a mg P2O5/10 g soil h 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 C HA BS HA + BS MC HA + MC Pb Pb + HA Pb + BS Pb + HA + BS Pb + MC Pb + HA + MC G G + HA G + BS G + HA + BS G + MC G + HA +MC mL NH3/10 g 4 h mL О2/ g min Fig . 1

 he Pb CH3COO 2 pollution reduced the biomass by 25 % 
 he applica tion of the bacterial–humus preparations favored the increase in the plant biomass by 40–50 % a faster tran sition from the stage of vegetation to the flowering stage was observed 
 he bacterial– humus preparations stronger increased the plant bio mass by 10–20 % than the introduction only of the bacterial suspensions

 n addition the biosynthetic origin of this hybrid PKS-NRPS natural product was unraveled by the in silico analysis of its biosynthetic gene cluster . M yxobacteria are known to be a reliable source of novel natural products with often unique structural features that are rarely observed in other organisms.1,2 To date more than 100 secondary metabolites with diﬀerent core structures and various biological activities have been isolated from myxobacterial sources.3 A majority of these metabolites derive from nonribosomal peptide synthetases polyketide synthases or are hybrids thereof.4,5 Already in 2001 we isolated antalid from Polyangium sp. strain Pl 4620 and determined its constitution.6 In the course of our current HPLC−MS based screening project the crude extract from a liquid culture of the same Polyangium sp . was re-evaluated and showed a secondary metabolite with m/z = 528.2518 for the M + H + ion 
 fter several extraction steps and puriﬁcation using RP-MPLC a total of 30 mg of the pure compound 1 was isolated see Supporting Information SI 
 tructure of antalid 1 : a planar structure and key 2D NMR correlations ( b absolute conﬁguration of the stereogenic centers . ppm 3J = 9.2 3.8 Hz in combination with the corresponding COSY and HMBC correlations indicated the presence of a Phe and a Val residue 
 MBC signals from 12-H 13-H 19-H and NHPhe and a downﬁeld shifted proton s 8.34 ppm to three diﬀerent quaternary carbons suggested the presence of a heteroaromatic ﬁve-membered ring which was identiﬁed as a thiazole in direct neighborhood to a carbonyl group 
 he PKSderived part of the molecule as inferred from COSY and HMBC couplings is terminated by a triple substituted double bond 8-H dd 6.60 ppm 3J = 8.5 1.3 Hz 
 he desired product was obtained in 63 % yield and was transformed to antalid 1 by removing the remaining TBS group with HF-pyridine in 90 % Scheme 3

n addition, the biosynthetic origin of this hybrid PKS-NRPS natural product was unraveled by the in silico analysis of its biosynthetic gene cluster.  M  yxobacteria are known to be a reliable source of novel natural products with often unique structural features that are rarely observed in other organisms.1,2 To date, more than 100 secondary metabolites with diﬀerent core structures and various biological activities have been isolated from myxobacterial sources.3 A majority of these metabolites derive from nonribosomal peptide synthetases, polyketide synthases, or are hybrids thereof.4,5 Already in 2001 we isolated antalid from Polyangium sp., strain Pl 4620, and determined its constitution.6 In the course of our current HPLC−MS based screening project, the crude extract from a liquid culture of the same Polyangium sp. was re-evaluated and showed a secondary metabolite with m/z = 528.2518 for the [M + H]+ ion 
 fter several extraction steps and puriﬁcation using RP-MPLC, a total of 30 mg of the pure compound (1) was isolated (see Supporting Information, SI)

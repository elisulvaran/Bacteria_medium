hese isolates included strains of Acinetobacter (strain CD06), Enterobacter sp. (strains CD01, CD03, CD04 and CD08) (similar strains also identiﬁed in culture-independent approach) and a strain of Stenotrophomonas sp 
he other strains were identiﬁed as Enterobacter sp. (designed as strain CD01, CD03, CD04 and CD08) and Acinetobacter sp. (designed as strain CD06), respectively 
train CD06 was identiﬁed as an Acinetobacter sp., and is most closely related to Acinetobacter radioresistens by 16S rDNA sequence alignment

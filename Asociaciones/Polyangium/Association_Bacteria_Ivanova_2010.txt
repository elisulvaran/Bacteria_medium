he number of hits in COG is less than 10 in bacteria except for the myxobacteria, Burkholderia mallei, B. pseudomallei, Mycobacterium spp. and members of the Streptomyces

enome evolution and the emergence of fruiting body development in Myxococcus xanthus 
hus they resemble the myxospores of Nannocystis species in being very tiny [1] 
n members of the genus Nannocystis and Polyangium, true steroids were detected, a very unusual trait among prokaryotes [6,29] 
his strain was published with the name Polyangium vitellinum [5], hence the accession entry of its sequence (AJ233944) was also registered with this species name up to November 2009 
owever, Reichenbach perceived that these organisms meet perfectly Kofler’s description of “Polyangium flavum”, but do not conform to the description of the genus Polyangium

 novel pathway for the biosynthesis of iso-even fatty acids (by α-oxidation of iso-odd fatty acids) was detected for the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca [28] 
s the genes most similar to the H. ochraceum RCC1-like proteins, as determined by protein BLAST with the NCBI database, derive exclusively from other myxobacteria such as P. pacifica or Stigmatella aurantiaca, it seems plausible that they build a myxobacterial branch within the RCC1 superfamily

he cells of the species follow a multicellular lifestyle in highly organized biofilms, called swarms, they decompose bacterial and yeast cells as most myxobacteria do 
 Standards in Genomic Sciences  Ivanova et al.  summary of the project information is shown in Table 2.  Growth conditions and DNA isolation  H. ochraceum SMP-2T, DSM 14365, was grown in CY medium with seawater salts (in grams per liter: casitone 3.0, yeast extract 1.0, NaCl 21.1, KCl  0.6, CaCl2 × 2 H2O 1.2, MgCl2 × 6 H2O 3.6, NaHCO3 0.09, MgSO4 × 7H2O 2.6, agar 15 g) [26] at 28°C 
he cells are equipped to decompose cells of other bacteria or yeasts [1] 
he fruiting bodies of strain SMP-2T are light yellow to yellowish-brown, irregular, sessile knobs with a diameter of 50-200 µm and contain one or more oval-shaped sporangioles, each 20-60 µm in size [1,2]

hylogenetic tree highlighting the position of H. ochraceum SMP-2T relative to the other type strains within the genus and the type strains of the other genera within the order Myxococcales 
he tree was inferred from 1,463 aligned characters [12,13] of the 16S rRNA gene sequence under the maximum likelihood criterion [14] and rooted in accordance with the current taxonomy 
NSDC databases indicate (as of December 2009) that members of Haliangium are very rare in the environment, with the most closely related The Genomic Standards Consortium  Haliangium ochraceum type strain (SMP-2T)  16S rRNA gene sequences from uncultured bacteria being less than 94% similar to H. ochraceum SMP-2T.  Classification and features  At the time of species description of the two Haliangium species, the most similar 16S rRNA gene sequence from cultivated strains originated from strain Pl vt1T

ruiting body formation was observed at salt concentrations corresponding to 40-100% sea water concentration but not at lower salt concentrations [23] 
he attempt to isolate halophilic myxobacteria was initiated by the detection of myxobacterial phylotypes in marine sediments [2] 
nly two other genera of marine myxobacteria, each comprising one species, have been described to date: Plesiocystis pacifica and Enhygromyxa salina [3,4] 
ll marine myxobacteria are phylogenetically grouped within one of the three suborders within the order Myxococcales, the Nannocystineae 
hile the two Haliangium species http://standardsingenomics.org  also contain anteiso-branched fatty acids as distinctive compounds [1], the specific feature of the two other marine genera Plesiocystis and Enhygromyxa is the presence of polyunsaturated C20:4 acids [3,4] 
t is noteworthy that the members of the other marine genera Plesiocystis and Enhygromyxa contain MK-8(H2) and MK-7, respectively [3,4]

train SMP-2T and P. pacifica, another rare marine myxobacterium, together with Salinispora arenicola are the prokaryotes with the highest degree of similarity of these genes, 15, 12, 14 and 15, respectively 
he authors found the highest percentage of yet unde-  scribed PKS sequences (50% of all newly detected PKS sequences) in the marine myxobacteria (as compared to terrestrial myxobacteria) 
ther promising fields of gene mining in H. ochraceum, as a representative of the marine myxobacteria, most likely are the genes of energy metabolism and the genes coding for the coordinated movement of cells during fruiting body and myxospore formation

he PCR products obtained from DNA extracted from soil were ﬁrst analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel and was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under short-wavelength UV light 
he analysis of the soil was conducted by soil survey and testing center, “National” Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan, China. 1.2 Isolation of cadmium resistant bacteria Bacteria were isolated from soil described above using Luria Bertani (LB) broth medium supplemented with 500 µmol/L CdCl2 (Lennox, 1955) 
equences obtained were compared to the non-redundant nucleotide database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information by using their World Wide Website, and the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm. 1.5 Heavy metal tolerance of isolated strains To examine the ability of the isolate strains to resist heavy metals, cells of strains CD01, CD06 and CD08 were grown in 250-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 50 ml of LB medium supplemented with 500 mol/L of heavy metals (Cd in CdCl2 , Cr in K2 Cr2 O7 , Ni in NiSO4 , Zn in ZnSO4 , Pb in Pb(NO3 )2 , and Cu in CuSO4 ) 
icrobes able to tolerate high concentrations of cadmium (500 µmol/L and above) were also isolated from the soil 
gricultural ﬁelds contaminated with the heavy metal cadmium have been a particular concern since it results in the contamination of the agricultural products such as rice 
he concentration of heavy metals was 3 mg/kg for cadmium and 115 mg/kg for chromium

ne of the isolates was identiﬁed as a Stenotrophomonas sp. and was published elsewhere since it has peculiar characteristics for cadmium resistance and antibiotic resistance (Chien et al., 2007) 
e also examined A. radioresistence ATCC15425 for its ability to resist cadmium and a much lower minimum inhibitory concentration was observed (500 µmol/L) compared to that of strain CD06 (1500 µmol/L) 
urther investigation is required for the conﬁrmation of the presence of the plasmids as well as the mechanisms of heavy metals resistance of these isolates.  3 Conclusions The microbial diversity in a soil sample from a site next to a chemical industrial factory previously heavily contaminated with cadmium was examined by both culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches

hey included Polyangium spp., Sphingomonas spp., Variovorax spp., Haﬁna spp., Clostridia, Acidobacteria, the enterics and some uncultured strains 
hese isolates included strains of Acinetobacter (strain CD06), Enterobacter sp. (strains CD01, CD03, CD04 and CD08) (similar strains also identiﬁed in culture-independent approach) and a strain of Stenotrophomonas sp 
he results indicated that the species identiﬁed from direct analysis of 16S rDNA of the soil can be quite diﬀerent from those strains obtained from enrichment cultures and the microbial activities for heavy metal resistance might be more appropriately addressed by the actual isolates 
ey words: cadmium; heavy metal; heavy metal resistant; microbial diversity; soil bacteria  Introduction Heavy metal contamination is a common environmental problem which presents a signiﬁcant health hazard and requires expensive cleanup costs 
dditionally, heavy metals can accumulate in biological systems and ultimately be introduced into food web via diﬀerent mechanisms (Giller et al., 1998) 
owever, studies on bacterial diversity in heavy metal contaminated sites still demonstrated a high diversity of microorganisms (Dean-Ross and Mills, 1989; Hattori 1992; Gelmi et al., 1994; Roane and Kellogg, 1996; Filali et al., 2000; Ellis et al., 2003; Konstantinidis et al., 2003) 
hey are indigenous organisms that have not only adapted to the new environments but have also ﬂourished under them (Haq and Shakoori, 2000; Roane and Pepper, 2000) 
icroorganisms possess a variety of mechanisms to deal with high concentrations of heavy metals and often are speciﬁc to one or a few metals * Corresponding author

herefore, speciﬁc heavy metal resistant determinants can be used as parameters for environmental forensic as biosensors (Haq and Shakoori, 2000; Zhou, 2003; Verma and Singh, 2005) 
n the other hand, the use of nucleic acidbased methods including biochips is believed to be more appropriate for the assessment of microbial community than those based on culturing techniques (Ovreas and Torsvik, 1998) 
tudy on the relationship between the diversity of the culturable portion of the microbial community and the microbial diversity obtained by direct ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA genes from soil have been discussed (Ellis et al., 2003) 
lso from the application of bioremediation point of view, the isolation of the microorganisms and the bacterial eﬀects in the removal of heavy metals is essential 
his suggests that from the application point of view, only the “actual” isolation of microorganisms may provide the ability to study the relationship between in situ microbial activities and those isolates able to be used for bioremediation applications.  1 Materials and methods 1.1 Experimental soil The experiment was conducted with soil from an agricultural ﬁeld contaminated with heavy metals in Lu-Chu, Taoyuan, Taiwan, due to the wastewater discharged to irrigation channel from a chemical industrial factory nearby in 1980s 
he pH of the collected sample was 4.6 and the organic carbon content was 3.7% 
he composition of the sample was 28% sand, 42% silt and 30% clay 
oil (0.5 g) was inoculated into 250-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂask containing 50 ml medium and incubated at 30°C with shaking (150 r/min) to maintain aerobic conditions 
ure cultures were obtained on the same medium solidiﬁed by addition of Bacto agar (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD, USA).  Vol. 20  universal primers F24 (Forward AGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG) and F25 (Reverse, AAGGAGGTGWTCCARCC) as described (Dewhirst et al., 1999) 
he PCR (20 µl) contained 1 µl of the DNA preparation, 1X Taq polymerase buﬀer (provided by the manufacturer), 1 mmol/L of each forward and reverse primer, 200 mmol/L of each deoxynucleotide (ddATP, ddGTP, ddCTP and ddTTP) and Taq polymerase (Yeastern Biotech Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) 2.5 U 
CR conditions were as follows: 95°C for 5 min followed by ampliﬁcation in which the following conditions were used: denaturation at 95°C for 45 s, annealing at 55°C for 60 s and elongation for 90 s at 72°C with an additional 10 min at 72°C for each cycle for the 30 cycles 
o., Ltd., Taiwan) and then transformed into competent Escherichia coli DH5α 
nother isolate (a strain of Stenotrophomonas) possess a peculiar ability for heavy metal resistance and was published elsewhere (Chien et al., 2007).  1.3 DNA extraction from the soil and bacterial isolates Bacterial DNA was extracted directly from soil using the SoilMaster™ DNA extraction kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
NA was also extracted directly from soil using bead beater and hot detergent treatment (Kuske et al., 1998) 
or pure cultures, cells were harvested and washed twice with 1 ml of sterile phosphate-buﬀered saline and the DNA was extracted from cell pellets by Triton-Prep method. 1.4 Ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and analysis of the PCR products The 16S rDNA genes were ampliﬁed with bacterial  2 Results and discussion 2.1 Bacterial diversity determined by culture-independent 16S rDNA analysis From the selected clones with insertion of direct ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA from soil, seventeen diﬀerent microbial types (genera and/or species) were identiﬁed from 40 random selected clones 
hey include bacteria belong to genera Polyangium, Sphingomonas, Variovorax, Haﬁna, Clostridia, Acidobacteria, bacteria belonging to the members of Enteribacteriaceae and some uncultured strains 
he identities were determined by partial 16S rDNA sequence analysis of these representative clones and sequence accession numbers are shown in Table 1 
he other strains were identiﬁed as Enterobacter sp. (designed as strain CD01, CD03, CD04 and CD08) and Acinetobacter sp. (designed as strain CD06), respectively 
he nucleotide sequence of partial 16S rDNA of strains CD06 and CD08 have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers EF198175 and EF198176, respectively. 2.3 Heavy metal resistance levels of strains CD01, CD06 and CD08 Strains CD01, CD06 and CD08 were able to resist to a variety of heavy metals 
trains CD01 and CD08 showed  361  the same pattern of heavy metal resistance, which also indicated these isolates maybe the same strains (Enterobacter sp.) 
train CD06 was identiﬁed as an Acinetobacter sp., and is most closely related to Acinetobacter radioresistens by 16S rDNA sequence alignment 
. radioresistens capable of degrading aromatic compounds has been reported to be sensitive to heavy metals regardless the bacterium possessed abundant plasmids (Pessione and Giunta, 1997) 
he growth curves of strain CD06, CD08 and an E. coli in the medium without addition of heavy metals in comparison to the growth curve in the medium supplemented with selected concentrations of diﬀerent heavy metals are shown in Fig.1 
he results showed that compared to the heavy metal resistant strains, E. coli did not grow in the medium containing Cd and Cr, and also had remarkably reduced growth in the medium  Table 1 List of the selected clones and their closest genera identiﬁed by 16S rDNA sequences Clone  Most closely related strain by 16S rDNAa  GenBank accession number  MB-01 (1)b MB-02 (2) MB-03 (4) MB-04 (1) MB-06 (1) MB 5-02 (1) A-04 (1) A-05 (2) A-07 (2) B-15 (3) MB 36 (3) MB 43 (1) MB 49 (12) MB 52 (1) MB 56 (2) MB 57 (1) MB 67 (2)  α-Proteobacterium (AB121772)c (96%) Hafnia alvei (Z83203) (98%) Uncultured bacterium CCM6b (AY221067) (97%) Variovorax paradoxus (DQ256487) (98%) Uncultured bacterium clone (DQ537533) (95%) Uncultured bacterium clone (AF507681) (92%) Polyangium cellulosum (AF467674) (96%) Uncultured Enterobacteriaceae (AY635972) (98%) Sphingomonas sp.

e did not employ anaerobic culturing techniques for our enrichment culture isolation, therefore, no Clostridium and related microorganisms were isolated in this study 
owever, anaerobic microorganisms unquestionably are one of the most signiﬁcant communities in such environment, and may also valuable for further bioremediation applications 
nterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella sp. isolated from industrial eﬄuents capable to resist to heavy metals were demonstrated to harbor related plasmids (Haq et al., 1999) 
he diﬀerent results between  culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches were due to both enrichment culture techniques bias and the relevance of the microbial resistant to the metal pollutants may not be totally relevant in culture-independent results 
owever, from the application of bioremediation point of view, the isolation of the microorganisms and the bacterial eﬀects on the removal of heavy metals are essential

etals are a signiﬁcant toxic factor to biota in the environment in their free ionic forms 
he required methods to most reliably determine the bacterial diversity of an environment is often hotly debated 
t is widely accepted that the enrichment culture approach only identiﬁes a small proportion of microorganisms in any given sample 
nd these are usually the organisms that grow best under the enrichment conditions provided 
nfortunately, there are drawbacks of these culture-independent approaches such as the relevance of the microbial activities to the metal pollutants can not be totally elucidated 
n this study, we studied the bacterial diversity of a soil  360  CHIEN Chihching et al.  sample from an agricultural ﬁeld previously contaminated with heavy metals 
xamination of the microbiota was carried out both by direct ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA genes from the sample as well as cultivation of the microorganisms 
s expected, our result indicated that the species identiﬁed from direct analysis of 16S rDNA genes of the soil was quite diﬀerent from those strains obtained from enrichment cultures 
ll the isolates showed robust-growth in the medium containing relative high concentration of heavy metals 
lthough the ﬁeld was under remediation process in late 1990s, the farmland is still not available for agriculture until recently 
he sample was collected from the top 5– 20 cm layer of the ﬁeld 
uriﬁed PCR products obtained from pure cultures of the isolates were also subjected for sequencing as described 
he partial 16S rDNA sequences of these bacteria were compared with the 16S rDNA sequences available in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD, USA) public database 
he results showed that the six isolates belonged to three different groups of bacteria

his has been also noticed in Stenotrophomonas sp. in which the strain isolated from heavy metal contaminated soil demonstrated much higher tolerance to heavy metals than those obtained from culture collection (Chien et al., 2007) 
rom the enrichment culture, four out of six isolates were identiﬁed as Enterobacter sp. according to the 16S rDNA sequence similarity 
acteria belong to Enterobacteriaceae were also identiﬁed in the culture-independent approach in higher proportion compared to many other type of microorganisms 
he other microorganism that was identiﬁed from culture-independent approach with the highest proportion was bacteria belong to Clostridiales

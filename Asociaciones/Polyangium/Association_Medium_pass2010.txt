evertheless this shift was quickly reversed highlighting a fast adaptative and efficient response of the metabolically active bacterial population 
oulon Centre for Resource Management and Efficiency School of Applied Sciences Department of Sustainable Systems Cranfield University Cranfield Bedfordshire MK43 0AL UK “ Etang-de-Berre ” bacterial communities inhabiting oiled sediments for decades adopted a specific structure depending on oil presence and were able to face hydrocarbon contamination quickly and efficiently . Introduction Oil pollutes by entering ecosystems naturally by seepage from reservoirs and through anthropogenic activities including the extraction of oil from reservoirs transportation processing in refineries and handling and disposal by end users 
il pollution of the sea and coastlines is difficult to contain and causes significant ecological perturbations leading to negative impacts on local fishing aquaculture and tourist industries 10 
ome oil components accumulate and biomagnify through the food chain and those that are mutagenic or carcinogenic are prejudicial to the long term health of marine organisms and their predators including humans 15 
ortunately a substantial proportion of the oil entering marine habitats is degraded by indigenous microorganisms and their use in bioremediation processes has proven to be an effective method for cleaning up residual oil in a variety of coastal environments 5 13 27 
great deal of research on the diversity and the metabolic activities of complex microbial communities able to cope with oil compounds in environment has been carried out but many unknowns persist and more work is needed to elucidate and understand their complexity 
he impact of oil on complex bacterial community structures and the bacterial capacity to degrade hydrocarbons has been mainly examined under mineral nutrient and/or bioremediation agent treatments 
ost of the pristine communities exposed to petroleum contamination presented a decrease in diversity associated with the selection of tolerant populations and then a resilience phenomenon 2 8 27 
n contrast the response of indigenous communities previously exposed to petroleum compounds dominated by organisms able to utilise and/or survive to toxic hydrocarbons is expected to occur faster and more specifically 4 14 
he bacterial community diversity may also be influenced by the complexity of chemical mixtures present and the length of the exposure time 
owever information on the early response within the first hours and days of a complex bacterial community to oil exposure is still scarce 
aining insights into the bacterial abundance phylogenetic structure changes and degradation activity occurring in the first stage of oil contamination would be of great interest since it is hypothesised that the hydrocarbonoclastic populations are established within 2 weeks in the community related to fast biodegradation events 14 
he aim of the present study was to determine the short- and mid-term modifications occurring on the preestablished bacterial communities from coastal sediment in response to a simulated oil spill 
he Etang-de-Berre a brackish lagoon bordering the Mediterranean Sea in the South of France is characterised by important industrial activities and receives important amounts of hydrocarbons from refineries petrochemical plants and transportation systems in addition to biogenic inputs 16 
hus combining gas chromatography-mass spectrometry GC-MS analysis culture-dependant and molecular approaches terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism TRFLP , 16S rRNA gene and transcript libraries , the response of whole microbial community and its active members was screened throughout a slurry experiment during the first hours and days after crude oil input . 395 Materials and Methods Sediment Sampling The subsurface sediments 0–2 cm were collected from the station EDB1 43°29′05″N 5°11′17″E of the Berre brackish lagoon bordering the Mediterranean Sea on October 2005 24

he UPGMA cluster analysis was performed using square root transformation of T-RFLP data and the Bray Curtis similarity index 
herefore the DNA based analysis did not show clear modifications in the total bacterial communities structure related to the incubation conditions B+OIL and B−OIL over the time days 0 7 and 14 ( Fig . 3

acterial Community Composition and Dynamics In order to further characterise the metabolically active communities 16S rRNA transcript libraries were constructed for a representative sample of each cluster identified by T-RFLP 
he analysis of the five libraries 0h B−OIL cluster A , 9d B+OIL cluster B , 9d B−OIL cluster C , 12d B+OIL cluster D and 12d B−OIL cluster E , allowed the identification of the dominant metabolically active populations associated to the presence of crude oil 
equences from patterns with more than one clone were mainly related to Gamma- 49 % and Deltaproteobacteria 35 % , followed by Diatom chloroplast 11 % , Alpha- 2 % , Epsilonproteobacteria 2 % and Acidobacteria 2 % sequences 
he comparison of the cDNA clone libraries with the LIBSHUFF method revealed that 12d B−OIL and 12d B+OIL libraries were composed of significantly different phylotypes XY p value=0.004 YX p value=0.021 while no difference could be observed between the 9d B−OIL and 9d B+OIL cDNA clone libraries XY p value=0.034 YX p value=0.174 , confirming the T-RFLP results Fig . 5 
he Deltaproteobacteria subclass maintained the same relative abundance from 0 h to 12 days in the B-OIL condition around 20 % whilst its abundance decreased until 11 % and 14 % at respectively 9 and 12 days of incubation in the B+OIL slurry Table 2 
he relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria sequence increased during the experiment period from 4 % at 0 h to respectively 14 % and to 23 % in oiled and unoiled conditions at 12 days Table 2

Discussion Heavily petroleum-contaminated sediment was chosen for this study since the community inhabiting these sediments is adapted to the presence of oil 24 and consequently its bacterial community presents more potential abilities than those from pristine environments to cope with oil hydrocarbons 
n order to reduce the low molecular-weight hydrocarbon content of sediment and to adapt the bacterial communities to laboratory conditions the collected sediments were weathered 
ndeed the metabolically active bacterial communities changed quickly and differentially depending on the incubation conditions 
or instance the unoiled community was rapidly modified during the experiment probably due to the depletion of hydrocarbon compounds mainly alkanes and low molecular weight PAHs and the ageing conditions of the microcosms whereas the B+OIL community structure was maintained closer to the original community due to the oil addition 
evertheless this shift was reversed after 1 h highlighting a fast adaptative and efficient response of the metabolically active bacterial population 
hus this study reinforces the concept that important processes in response to oil contamination occur within few hours following an oil Table 1 Characteristics of the 0h B−OIL DNA and 0h B−OIL 9d B−OIL 9d B+OIL 12d B−OIL 12d B+OIL cDNA clone libraries Sample 0h B−OIL DNA 0h B−OIL cDNA 9d B−OIL cDNA 12d B−OIL cDNA 9d B+OIL cDNA 12d B+OIL cDNA a Singletons not sequenced Total no . of clones No . of taxa No . of singletons Coverage Shannon index 364 86 79 54 60 57 285 61 57 47 44 46 240a 46 46 41 36 37 0.34 0.45 0.42 0.24 0.36 0.35 5.511 3.946 3.838 3.800 3.625 3.757 402 S

hese processes lead to an efficient biodegradation which probably include many other biological processes such as remarkable bacterial resilience to toxicity and physico-chemical modifications of the oil degrading matrix 
he significant increase in numbers of hydrocarbondegrading bacteria the high proportion of sequences affiliated to hydrocarbon-degrading strains in the initial community and the high abundance of highly specialised metabolically active oil-degrading populations confirmed the adaptation of this community to the oil presence 
oth oil amended and unamended microcosms showed a high proportion of active bacteria related to hydrocarbon degraders as expected since these specialised bacteria were found dominant in the community present in the slurry 
his observation suggests that essential mechanisms take place during the early period however further investigations are requested to understand and characterise them

n order to examine the early structural response of a complex bacterial community to oil pollution a kinetic study of the crude oil impact on bacterial communities inhabiting sediments from the contaminated Etang-de-Berre lagoon was performed 
uring this period 54 % of crude oil was biodegraded showing the importance of the early degradation step 
he metabolically active community 16S rRNA transcript analysis was immediately impacted by the oil input observed as an apparent decrease of species richness in the first hour of incubation 
he high proportion of sequences related to hydrocarbonoclastic strains or petroleum-associated clones in active oiled community was consistent with significant increasing numbers of cultivable hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria at the end of the experiment 
lthough some studies showed that these treatments Coastal bacterial Community Dynamic to Oil Response improved significantly the oil biodegradation 7 27 , other studies demonstrated either no effect of nutrient addition 20 or that the nutrients have a greater impact on the bacterial community than the oil alone 8 
oreover the bioremediation agents produce residues that showed a relatively high toxicity 7 
n addition oil impact on the bacterial community depends on the history of the site pollution 
ecent works showed that the study of the metabolically active populations provides new insights for the characterization of the bacterial community response to oil contamination 2 21 
he bacterial communities inhabiting these sediments being well-adapted to the oil presence seemed to carry all the metabolic machinery for coping with hydrocarbon exposure 
hus these bacterial communities constitute an interesting environmental model to gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of biodegradation in contaminated coastal environments 
his level of contamination was chosen to simulate an oil spill that is likely to induce a perturbation in the bacterial communities 
he remaining slurries were defined as the bioticunamended condition B − OIL 
29 to C39 aliphatic compounds were also found representing around 1 % of the total aliphatics Table S1 Electronic supplementary material 
ach percentage represents the mean of hydrocarbon fractions from replicate samples S 
or molecular analysis the slurry samples were centrifuged at 8,000×g for 5 min at 4°C 
or each compound quantification was performed by integrating the peak at specific m/z 
he significance of hydrocarbon degradation relative to controls was determined by repeated measures of analysis of variance followed by the post-hoc Tukey 's multiple comparison test when P < 0.05 
he manufacturer instructions were followed except for the initial step of lysis in which each sediment sample were vortexed horizontally during 20 min 
o remove any genomic DNA contamination the samples were treated with Turbo DNase Ambion 
equences were first analysed using the CHECK CHIMERA programme on the RDP Database Project website http //rdp8.cme.msu.edu/ html/ [ 6 
hen sequences were compared with the GenBank nucleotide database library by BLAST on-line searches 1 
he significance of the branching order was determined by bootstrap analysis with 1000 resampled data sets 
n The total hydrocarbon concentration of the sediment slurries before Vic Bilh oil addition was 5 mg/kg of dried weight sediment 
nce Vic Bilh crude oil was added to the slurries as expected the oil fraction mass balance was reverted to a dominance of aliphatic hydrocarbons 76 % over aromatics 24 % ( Fig.1 
or the oiled slurry the same trend was Coastal bacterial Community Dynamic to Oil Response 399 observed for the beginning of the experiment but the number of oil-degraders increased significantly 1×108 to 1.67×108 CFU/ml after 14 days of incubation 
fter successive cultures of the 30 strains isolated from agar plate to liquid medium two were able to grow quickly on hexadecane as sole carbon source 
he low similarity 37 % between these two community profiles based on the relative abundance of terminal-restriction fragments T-RFs confirmed the structure modifications induced by the experimental procedures 
icrocosm triplicate averages were used for the cluster analysis microcosm communities were higher than 67 % which were similar to those obtained between replicates up to 70 % 
temporal modification is observed in both microcosms that were related to the well known bottle effect 
il addition induced an immediate shift within 1 h in the metabolically active bacterial community structure Fig . 4a 
owever the metabolically active community was restored 1 h later 
ollowing this first step of adaptation the communities were stable during 3 days 
hus the T-RFLP analysis showed five main clusters the first cluster A 400 S 
he two last clusters included the communities from day 12 to 14 cluster D was formed by communities from oiled microcosms while the cluster E contained the communities from unoiled microcosms 
s expected the Shannon diversity indices indicated a higher diversity at DNA level than RNA Table 1 
he RFLP analysis of the initial DNA community library revealed that 84 % of the clones analysed were singletons 
he Gammaproteobacteria group was also dominant in all the RNA libraries throughout the experiment 
hanges in the relative abundance of the main groups composing the metabolically active communities were observed 
n contrast the Gammaproteobacteria group reached 58 % of the active members of the oiled slurry at the end of the experiment while its abundance decreased significantly in the unoiled slurry Table 3 
his important proportion of sequences related to highly specialised bacteria in the community studied was also observed in the metabolically active bacterial community 
hese abilities include not only biodegradation capacities 3 , but also a higher resistance potential to the toxic effect of the pollutant 
hus after this treatment the observed bacterial community response would be specifically linked with the crude oil addition 
he slurry setting also promotes aerobic metabolisms that are well-known to be more efficient in hydrocarbon biodegradation process nevertheless because the oxygenation was exclusively performed by air diffusion we assume that anoxic niches can not be excluded 
uring the slurry experiment no significant change in the total bacterial community structure was observed in response to oil input despite the fact that an important part of the hydrocarbon compounds was biodegraded in 7 days 
hus the short 2 3 4 5 7 9 12 14 Incubation time day incubation period performed in this study allowed to describe the fast response of the community present in the slurry by analysing the active community rRNA transcripts analysis 
revious studies performed at DNA level on pristine or low contaminated communities indicated that after an important lag period 2 12 oil contamination induced drastic changes in the bacterial community structure associated with a decrease of diversity 27 31 
hese modifications were either attributed to a strong selection for petroleum-degrading bacteria 13 17 31 , or to toxic effect of oil on the growth of certain microorganisms 12 
n our case i.e . a bacterial community inhabiting heavily contaminated sediments with a long history of contamination , oil appeared necessary for maintaining the metabolically active populations 
il addition induced a qualitative shift specific richness decrease in the metabolically active community after 1 h 
he percentage includes only the patterns with more than one clone spill event 
lthough increases of the proportion of hydrocarbon–degraders in response to hydro- carbon contamination have been previously observed 4 , such a high proportion of hydrocarbon-degrading organisms detected within sediment bacterial community have not previously been described 
he sediments of the retention basin of the Berre lagoon represent an exceptional environment associated to crude oil pollution 
evertheless it is important to note that both communities are significantly different since the gammaproteobacteria responded faster to the 404 hydrocarbon input suggesting that they have probably an important role in hydrocarbon depletion 
nterestingly the relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria increased during the course of the experiment irrespective of the slurry condition 
his finding is in agreement with other studies that suggest that these bacterial groups succeed to Gammaproteobacteria in the process of bioremediation 2 27 
his is further supported by the higher relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria observed in the unoiled slurry compared with the oiled slurry since the bioremediation process in the unoiled slurry was ahead compared to the oiled slurry 
o the best of our knowledge the present work is the first study reporting the succession of metabolically active bacterial populations occurring during the early stage of the response to oil contamination 
he T-RFLP fingerprints revealed an important modification of the metabolically active bacterial community structure within the first hours following oil addition 
he bacterial communities from the sediment of the Etang de Berre ecosystem exhibited several properties that are suitable for studying the early response at the functional level to fully understand the metabolic strategy developed by the whole community to face crude oil contamination

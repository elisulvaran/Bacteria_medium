he objective of this work is to study the effect of bacterial–humus preparations based on Gumigel (Agros  OBJECTS AND METHODS The studies were conducted with two bacterial– humus preparations representing a solution of potas sium humate isolated from brown coal (Gumigel, Agrosintez Company) enriched with the following: (1) a mixture of pure Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas bacterial cultures (further HA + BC), and (2) a complex of microorganisms (HA + SC) isolated from a mucky– gley soil (Training and Experimental Soil–Ecological Center Chashnikovo, Moscow State University) and containing bacteria of the Bacillus, Arthrobacter, Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas, Cytophaga, Myxococcus, and Aquaspirillum genera 
hanges in the share of Bacillus (a), Pseudomo nas (b), and Rhodococcus (c) bacteria in the structure of the saprotroph bacterial complex.  the genera studied was used for the characterization of the saprotrophic bacterial complex structure accord ing to the following gradations: dominants—more than 30% of the total number of bacteria counted on the applied medium; subdominants—20–30%; the group of medium abundance—10–20%; and the minor components—less than 10% 
he soil pollution caused an increase in the share of Bacillus bacteria capable of enduring unfavorable conditions by forming spores 
n order to determine the contribution of the humic and bacterial components to the biological activ  400  THE INFLUENCE OF BACTERIAL–HUMUS PREPARATIONS  ity of the soils, experiments with the application of bacterial Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas suspensions, suspensions of the microbial complex from the mucky–gley soil (the bacterial titer is 109 cell/ml), and a sterile preparation of humic acid (Gumigel) were performed 
 total of 18 variants were tested in the model experiment: (1) C—the control soil; (2) HA—the soil with the application of sterile humic acid; (3) BS—the soil with the application of Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas bacterial suspensions; (4) MC—the soil with the appli cation of the microbial complex of the mucky–gley soil; (5) HA + BS—the soil with the application of humic acids enriched with Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas bacteria; (6) HA + MC—the soil with the application of humic acids enriched with the microbial complex of the mucky–gley soil; (7) Pb—the soil contaminated with Pb(CH3COO)2; (8) Pb + HA—the soil contami nated with Pb(CH3COO)2 and sterile humic acid; (9) Pb + BS—the soil contaminated with Pb(CH3COO)2 and the application of Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas bacterial suspensions; (10) Pb + MC—the soil contaminated with Pb(CH3COO)2 and the application of the microbial complex of the mucky–gley soil; (11) Pb + HA + BS—the soil con taminated with Pb(CH3COO)2 and the application of the humic acid preparation enriched with Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas bacteria; (12) Pb + HA + MC—the soil contaminated with Pb(CH3COO)2 and the applica tion of the humic the humic acid preparation enriched with the microbial complex of the mucky–gley soil; (13) G—the soil contaminated with gasoline; (14) G + HA—the soil contaminated with gasoline with the application of sterile humic acid; (15) G + BS—the soil contaminated with gasoline with the application of Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas bacterial suspensions; (16) G + MC—the soil contaminated with gasoline and the application of the microbial complex of the mucky–gley soil; (17) G + HA + BS—the soil contam inated with gasoline and the application of the humic acid preparation enriched with Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas bacteria; and (18) G + HA + MC—the soil contaminated with gasoline and the application of humic acid preparation enriched with the complex of microorganisms from the mucky–gley soil 
acte ria of the Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas genera that often are present in the preparations used for the remediation of oilpolluted soils are of a special interest 
he studies showed that Pb(CH3COO)2 in the polluted soils inhibited the development of Pseudomonas bacteria to a great extent (Fig. 5c) 
he introduction of bacterial suspensions to the soil increased the share of Pseudomonas bacteria up to 0.9 and 2.0% in the pure Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas cultures and in the soil microbial com plex, respectively 
n this case, Pseudomonas bacteria are in the group of minor components 
he use of the bacterial–humus preparations also promoted the increase in the pro portion of Pseudomonas bacteria 
he soil pollution less adversely affected the devel opment of Rhodococcus bacteria than that of the Pseudomonas representatives 
or studying the effect of the bacterial–humus prep arations on the structure of the bacterial community, the method of plating on an agar glucose–peptone– yeast medium was applied [8]

he very first AT domain of module 1 is likely a remnant of an old version of the cluster where the KS Q was still able to catalyze the condensation reaction 
fter MUSCLE alignment, the resulting alignment file was forwarded to the PhyML3.0 pipeline for refinement (JTT amino acid substitution model, bootstrap = 100).4 The resulting tree is visualized as unrooted tree with transformed branches (cladogram) using Geneious 9.0.4 (Biomatters). 21  Figure 15: Phylogenetic tree of C-domain amino acid sequence alignment using MUSCLE for alignment and PhyML3.0 for tree creation and refinement. (JTT amino acid substitution model, bootstrap = 100) 
he first domain ant-m1-KS lacks the active site cysteine at position 163.  Note that this KS domain lacks the cys to glu replacement which is typical for KS Q domains found in loading modules of modular PKS but rather features the cys to ser replacement often found in trans-AT-related KS0 domains.5–7 However, a KS domain alignment and subsequent calculation of a phylogenetic tree revealed that AntA-KS1 is closer to KSQ than to KS0 domains which is in line with the modular PKSI architecture of the antalid cluster 
pecial CT domains which are able to cyclize NRPS-based compounds from the assembly line are known from several fungal gene clusters.1 For PKS-based compounds, only FK520 and rapamycin biosynthesis feature a terminal C domain that are likely involved in cyclization of the natural products.1 However, in both natural products the terminal amino acid is an uncommon pipecolate which may have caused yet another special type of CT domain

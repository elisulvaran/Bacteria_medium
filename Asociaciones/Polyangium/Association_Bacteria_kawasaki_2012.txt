acillus appeared to respond indirectly to pyrene stress via the plant, as the proportion of Bacillus sequences increased from 3% in Hom-C to 9% in Het-Cpyr (Table 3), and members of this genus may be responding to specific metabolites released by the plant when subjected to pyrene stress.  Discussion Enhanced microbial PAH degradation in plant rhizospheres has been demonstrated before, but the complex interactions between the plant and the rootcolonizing microbes that occur during the rhizoremediation process still remain unclear

his result indicates that the indirect PAH contamination effect on the rhizosphere community via the plant is not observed in all plants, and more work is required to delineate the range of this phenomenon.

lant growth conditions and construction of the split-root system White clover (Trifolium repens), ryegrass (Lolium perenne), red fescue (Festuca rubra), Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum), red lentil (Lens culinaris var. microsperma), and chickpea (Cicer arietinum) seeds were purchased from Emorsgate Seeds (Norfolk, UK) or Heritage Seeds (Mulgrave, Vic., Australia) 
he split root systems were done in Lansdowne farm soil, and contained a white clover with pyrene; b white clover with phenanthrene; c chickpea with pyrene; d subterranean clover with pyrene; e red lentil with pyrene contamination 
MDS based on the DGGE banding pattern showed that in chickpea and subterranean clover, indirect PAH contamination affected the bacterial community structure of the Het-C pyr rhizospheres (Fig. 2c & d), since the Het-Cpyr communities were significantly different from those of Hom-C (p00.0364 and 0.0106 respectively, for the two species) 
rowth of both chickpea and subterranean clover was significantly affected by the pyrene contamination, with 27% (p00.005, n05) and 31% (p00.001, n05) reduction in their shoot dry weights respectively 
hen white clover, chickpea and subterranean clover were cultivated with pyrene contamination in one side of the split-root system, the microbial population in the counterpart uncontaminated rhizosphere (Het-Cpyr) was significantly different from that observed when the plants were grown in homogeneous uncontaminated control conditions (Hom-C) (Fig. 2a, c & d, Fig. 3a) 
ome of these compounds are known human carcinogens (Schneider et al. 2002) and 16 PAHs have been prioritized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for environmental regulation (Habe and Omori 2003)

MDS results were further subjected to analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) with the Euclidean distance using Palaeontological Statistics (PAST) package to assess the similarities between the rhizosphere microbial communities.  Results Impact of heterogeneous PAH contamination on the bacterial community structure of white clover rhizospheres In order to examine indirect, plant-mediated effects of soil contamination on rhizosphere microbial communities, we constructed a split root experiment with white clover (T. repens) grown in Lansdowne Farm soil, and treated with either pyrene (500 μg/g soil) or phenanthrene (1,000 μg/g soil) under homogeneous or heterogeneous treatment conditions 
sing HPLC and fluorometric detection, we were unable to detect plant-mediated transfer of pyrene from the Het-Pyr rhizosphere into the Het-Cpyr rhizosphere, and this suggests that the effect must be an indirect one, with the white clover plant itself responding to pyrene-contamination stress in a systemic manner to influence the composition of the rhizosphere bacterial community 
t the level of plant yield, white clover also displayed a much greater level of growth inhibition in response to pyrene contamination than for phenanthrene contamination, with 51% (p00.038) and 28% (p00.226) reduction in the shoot dry weights respectively (n05), suggesting that the plants were less susceptible to PAH stress from phenanthrene

his confirms the effect that was seen in the white clover pyrene split-root system (Fig. 2a) 
s for white clover, the indirect PAH contamination effect on the rhizosphere microbes is most apparent when the plant also shows a growth phenotype caused by the level of PAH applied 
o test whether the indirect PAH response observed above was a general phenomenon, we performed the white clover split-root experiment in a second soil (Lindow soil), which was obtained from Lindow Turf, Cheshire, UK 
his confirmed the result seen after growth in Lansdowne Farm soil and demonstrated that the white clover response to pyrene stress and the subsequent effect on the rhizosphere bacterial community is not specific to the soil tested 
he fungal community in white clover half-rhizospheres was also analyzed, using T-RFLP targeting the ITS region

nalysis of the bacterial communities in the white clover rhizospheres by tag-pyrosequencing (Fig. 4) identified several groups of bacteria that are directly enhanced by pyrene contamination, and others that are indirectly enhanced by pyrene contamination via the plant

anger et al. (2010) used a split-root system to study  the effect of heterogeneous hydrocarbon pollution and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization on bush bean growth and root morphology, by contaminating one side of the split-root system with crude oil, or inoculating it with AMF 
n this study, plant effects on the development of rhizosphere microbial communities in heterogeneously contaminated soils were assessed for three grasses (ryegrass, red fescue and Yorkshire fog) and four legumes (white clover, chickpea, subterranean clover and red lentil) 
hickpea, subterranean clover and red lentil were cultivated using the split-root system in Lansdowne Farm soil with or without 500 μg pyrene per gram soil 
n the rhizospheres of chickpea, subterranean clover and red lentil, by contrast, 16.1%, 22.1% and 32.9% of pyrene, respectively, had been degraded after 21 days of incubation 
n alfalfa rhizosphere, for example, removal of anthracene was enhanced 28% compared to the unplanted control soil, and alfalfa root exudates were shown to increase the solubilization of anthracene by 50% (Kim et al. 2004), confirming the  Plant Soil (2012) 358:169–182  important part that the plant plays in increasing pollutant bioavailability to the soil microbes 
his is contrary to our finding that Verrucomicrobia were stimulated in the presence of pyrene, and also to another study which reported that PAH-contaminated soil planted with alfalfa specifically favoured the development of Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria (Cébron et al. 2009) 
n ryegrass rhizosphere, removal of eight PAHs ranging from three to six aromatic rings in size was significantly higher than in unvegetated soil, and the number of culturable PAH degraders was also increased (Binet et al. 2000) 
eterogeneous PAH contamination does not control the rhizosphere community structure of grass species In order to test whether the indirect PAH contamination effect observed above for legumes is also seen in other plants, we conducted split-root experiments on three grass species, ryegrass (Lolium perenne), red fescue (Festuca rubra) and Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus) 
nitially, we tested ryegrass for the indirect PAH contamination effect by cultivating it in the splitroot system using Lindow soil with pyrene contamination (500 μg/g soil) for 21 days 
-RFLP analysis of the ryegrass rhizosphere bacterial communities showed that the community structures were not affected by pyrene treatment of the other half of the plant (Het-Cpyr was not significantly different from Hom-C, Fig. 3b) 
t this concentration of pyrene (500 μg/g soil), ryegrass growth showed a 23% reduction in the shoot dry weight, but it was not significantly inhibited (p00.084, n05), and we postulated that the absence of an indirect PAH contamination effect might be due to insufficient inhibition of ryegrass by pyrene at this level 
hen ryegrass root exudates were added to a phenanthrene-contaminated soil, the population of Gram negative bacteria possessing PAH ring hydroxylating dioxygenase genes was significantly increased compared to the same contaminated soil without addition of exudates, and the diversity of the genes also differed between the exudate-treated and untreated soils (Cébron et al. 2011)

nce the root system had grown sufficiently, the seedling was transferred into a small plastic pot (27×27×45 mm) in such a way that the root system extended from two holes (approx. 10×25 mm) at the bottom of the pot 
fter 10 days, the split-root system was constructed by fixing the small pot containing the plant onto the middle of two larger pots (38 × 38×50 mm) (Fig. 1) with the roots extending into the pots on either side, which contained either PAHcontaminated soil or uncontaminated soil (Table 2) 
his may explain the absence of the indirect contamination effect on microbial communities in phenanthrene-treated clover plants.  Plant Soil (2012) 358:169–182  175  a

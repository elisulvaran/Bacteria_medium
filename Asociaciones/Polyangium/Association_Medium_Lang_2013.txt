or a species of the genus Melittangium and two species of the genus Polyangium, no physical type material was assigned at the time of validation of the names or later on 
n accordance with rule 18f of the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria the following type strains are designated for these species: strain Cm a14T (5DSM 14605T5JCM 12615T) as the type strain of Chondromyces apiculatus, strain Cm c5T (5DSM 14714T5JCM 12616T) as the type strain of Chondromyces crocatus, strain Sy t2T (5DSM 14631T5JCM 12617T) as the type strain of Chondromyces lanuginosus, strain Cm p51T (5DSM 14607T5JCM 12618T) as the type strain of Chondromyces pediculatus, strain Me b8T (5DSM 14713T5JCM 12633T) as the type strain of Melittangium boletus, strain Pl s12T (5DSM 14670T5JCM 12637T) as the type strain of Polyangium sorediatum and strain Pl sm5T (5DSM 14734T5JCM 12638T) as the type strain of Polyangium spumosum 
urthermore, the type strains given for three species of the genera Cystobacter and Polyangium had been kept at one university institute and have been lost according to our investigations 
n accordance with Rule 18c of the Bacteriological Code, we propose the following neotype strains: strain Cb fe18 (5DSM 14716 5JCM 12624) as the neotype strain of Cystobacter ferrugineus, strain Cb m2 (5DSM 147515JCM 12627) as the neotype strain of Cystobacter minus and strain Pl fu5 (5DSM 146685JCM 12636) as the neotype strain of Polyangium fumosum 
he proposals of the strains are based on the descriptions and strain proposals given in the respective chapters of Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (2005).  An exceptionally high number of myxobacterial species descriptions is not supported by the availability of formally acknowledged living type strain material 
hese are the most frequently used guides in taxonomy currently, and for that reason, great efforts are taken to fill the sequencing gaps (Yarza et al., 2013) 
n this communication, we formally designate type strains for seven and formally propose neotype strains for three species of the order Myxococcales 
he present wording of Rule 18f of the International Code is: ‘If a description or illustration constitutes, or a dead preserved specimen has been designated as the type of a species [Rule 18a(1)] and a later strain of this species is cultivated, then the type strain may be designated by the  Downloaded from www.microbiologyresearch.org by 056440 G 2013 IUMS IP: 189.155.188.202 On: Sat, 17 Feb 2018 05:03:38  Printed in Great Britain  http://ijs.sgmjournals.org  Table 1

our species of the genus Chondromyces are represented by dead herbarium samples as the type material 
ecause of this lack of material, the species could not be included, for example, in species-representing 16S rRNA gene sequence databases 
he International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (Lapage et al., 1992) allows for the designation of type strains in cases where descriptions or dead specimens represent the type given for species with validly published species names. 3Retired 
wo supplementary tables are available with the online version of this paper.  4354  The code also allows for the proposal of neotype strains if a specimen of the strain on which the original description was based cannot be found 
hese measures have been installed in order to clear the way for inclusion of such species in future examinations, in particular in studies including ‘new’ methods which had not been applied at the time of the species description 
his type strain shall then replace the description, illustration or preserved specimen as the nomenclatural type

he designation of the type strains is based on the descriptions given in the respective chapters of Bergey’s Manual (Reichenbach 2005a, c, d) 
n order to facilitate the comparison of these recent descriptions with those of the authors who originally proposed, revived or emended the species these original descriptions are assembled in Table S1 available in IJSEM Online

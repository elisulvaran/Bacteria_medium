 n the pyrene-contaminated bulk soil pyrene remained stable over the time period and after 30 days of soil incubation only 4.9 % had been degraded

 t this concentration of pyrene 500 μg/g soil ryegrass growth showed a 23 % reduction in the shoot dry weight but it was not significantly inhibited p00.084 , n05 , and we postulated that the absence of an indirect PAH contamination effect might be due to insufficient inhibition of ryegrass by pyrene at this level

 he most dominant bacterial group in all rhizospheres was Proteobacteria Alpha Beta Gamma and Deltaproteobacteria , which represented 55–70 % of the total bacterial community 
 acillus appeared to respond indirectly to pyrene stress via the plant as the proportion of Bacillus sequences increased from 3 % in Hom-C to 9 % in Het-Cpyr Table 3 and members of this genus may be responding to specific metabolites released by the plant when subjected to pyrene stress . Discussion Enhanced microbial PAH degradation in plant rhizospheres has been demonstrated before , but the complex interactions between the plant and the rootcolonizing microbes that occur during the rhizoremediation process still remain unclear

 owever phenanthrene contamination showed a greater effect on the plant growth reducing red fescue shoot dry weight by 56 % p00.001 n05 and Yorkshire fog shoot dry weight by 47 % p00.000 n05 
 he plants were cultivated for 30 days and the rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed with T-RFLP

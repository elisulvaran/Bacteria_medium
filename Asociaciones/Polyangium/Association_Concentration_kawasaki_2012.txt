 hickpea, subterranean clover and red lentil were cultivated using the split-root system in Lansdowne Farm soil with or without 500 μg pyrene per gram soil 
 n the pyrene-contaminated bulk soil, pyrene remained stable over the time period, and after 30 days of soil incubation only 4.9% had been degraded 
 n the rhizospheres of chickpea, subterranean clover and red lentil, by contrast, 16.1%, 22.1% and 32.9% of pyrene, respectively, had been degraded after 21 days of incubation 
 t this concentration of pyrene (500 μg/g soil), ryegrass growth showed a 23% reduction in the shoot dry weight, but it was not significantly inhibited (p00.084, n05), and we postulated that the absence of an indirect PAH contamination effect might be due to insufficient inhibition of ryegrass by pyrene at this level

 rifolium is indeed known to be able to uptake PAH to their roots, but translocation to the shoots is very restricted and the concentration of PAH in the shoots is 100 times lower than in the roots (Gao et al. 2008) 
 o test whether the indirect PAH response observed above was a general phenomenon, we performed the white clover split-root experiment in a second soil (Lindow soil), which was obtained from Lindow Turf, Cheshire, UK 
 nitially, we tested ryegrass for the indirect PAH contamination effect by cultivating it in the splitroot system using Lindow soil with pyrene contamination (500 μg/g soil) for 21 days 
  study on the effect of phenanthrene contamination on sorghum root exudation showed that when the plant was grown in a high concentration of phenanthrene (100 mg/kg), the total amount of exuded compounds decreased by 78%, due to phenanthrene damaging the root system 
 n this study, we confirmed that only legume species whose growth was inhibited by the PAH concentration tested showed responses to the PAH contamination by modifying their rhizosphere microbial populations 
 nitial PAH concentrations were  500 μg pyrene/g soil or 1,000 μg phenanthrene/g soil

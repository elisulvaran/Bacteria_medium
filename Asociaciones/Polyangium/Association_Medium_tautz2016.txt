imilar to the biosynthetic route our initial strategy for the synthesis of antalid 1 was to establish the macrocyclization of seco acid 2 through an ester linkage as the pivotal step Scheme 1 
n order to liberate the amino and acid functionalities we relied on the alloc protecting group and an allyl ester which could be removed selectively under the same reaction conditions in a single transformation 
he allyl ester allowed mild deprotecting conditions and established acid 6 in high yields through deprotection with palladium and N-methylaniline Scheme 2 
he synthesis of thiazole 5 started out from known ester 1530,31 and introduced an allyl moiety to selectively deprotect both the acid and the amine under mild conditions at the end of the synthesis 
ext acid 6 was brought to reaction with thiazole 5 employing EDC and HOBt which removed the TES group simultaneously 
he removal of both protecting groups was a clean transformation and we therefore subjected the corresponding amino acid directly to cyclization conditions utilizing HATU

he structure elucidation of 1 was performed with the aid of mass spectrometry high ﬁeld NMR experiments and crystal structure analysis 
he absolute conﬁguration of antalid was conﬁrmed through the Mosher ester method and ultimately by total synthesis 
n addition the biosynthetic origin of this hybrid PKS-NRPS natural product was unraveled by the in silico analysis of its biosynthetic gene cluster . M yxobacteria are known to be a reliable source of novel natural products with often unique structural features that are rarely observed in other organisms.1,2 To date more than 100 secondary metabolites with diﬀerent core structures and various biological activities have been isolated from myxobacterial sources.3 A majority of these metabolites derive from nonribosomal peptide synthetases polyketide synthases or are hybrids thereof.4,5 Already in 2001 we isolated antalid from Polyangium sp. strain Pl 4620 and determined its constitution.6 In the course of our current HPLC−MS based screening project the crude extract from a liquid culture of the same Polyangium sp . was re-evaluated and showed a secondary metabolite with m/z = 528.2518 for the M + H + ion 
ubsequent dereplication based on retention time accurate mass and isotope pattern using our in-house database for myxobacterial compounds indicated that the respective peak could be identical with antalid 
fter several extraction steps and puriﬁcation using RP-MPLC a total of 30 mg of the pure compound 1 was isolated see Supporting Information SI 
he exact twodimensional structure was elucidated using 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy Figure 1a 
tructure of antalid 1 : a planar structure and key 2D NMR correlations ( b absolute conﬁguration of the stereogenic centers . ppm 3J = 9.2 3.8 Hz in combination with the corresponding COSY and HMBC correlations indicated the presence of a Phe and a Val residue 
MBC signals from 12-H 13-H 19-H and NHPhe and a downﬁeld shifted proton s 8.34 ppm to three diﬀerent quaternary carbons suggested the presence of a heteroaromatic ﬁve-membered ring which was identiﬁed as a thiazole in direct neighborhood to a carbonyl group 
he PKSderived part of the molecule as inferred from COSY and HMBC couplings is terminated by a triple substituted double bond 8-H dd 6.60 ppm 3J = 8.5 1.3 Hz 
inally HMBC correlations from 5-H/19-H to 20-C and 10 H/12-H to 11-C determined the cyclic structure of antalid 
yntheses of Segments 6 and 5 reductase and enoyl reductase domains in the past,7 we identiﬁed and sequenced the biosynthetic gene cluster Ant-m2-KR and Ant-m3-KR 
xamination of the conﬁguration at hydroxyl branches 3-C 5-C was performed using our statistical method10 since typical identiﬁers such as the LDD motif or the indicative tryptophan that are required according to Caﬀrey8 and McDaniel9 were missing SI 
n order to ﬁnalize the structure the absolute conﬁguration of 3-C was clariﬁed by preparing S - and R Mosher esters of the alcohol at the respective carbon which unambiguously revealed the 3D structure of antalid as shown in Figure 1b.11 Detailed preparation protocols and all MS and NMR data are included in the SI 
XXX XXX XXX−XXX Letter Organic Letters product by special terminal C domains CT .17 Bacterial C domains of similar function have been reported for the pipecolate-containing compounds FK520 and rapamycin.18 In addition a recently characterized new type of terminal C domain can release linear carboxylic acids from the assembly line.19 Protein sequence alignment using the NaPDoS web tool resulted in a clear grouping of the pipecolate-related CT domains in a single clade while the terminal antalid C domain is located among the fungal CT Figure 2C and SI .20 This ﬁnding is supported by a more comprehensive alignment which revealed distinct groups for all three atypical C domains and even indicated a subgrouping of the antalid domain slightly apart from the fungal CT SI 
n the forward direction the synthesis of the polyketide fragment started with a Nagao aldol reaction using reagent 7 and propanal.25,26 Subsequent conversion to the Weinreb amide followed by TBS protection provided compound 8.27 Reduction to the corresponding aldehyde28 and Evans aldol reaction established the remaining two chiral centers of the polyketide segment 
ransformation to aldehyde 11 was achieved with the established sequence of Weinreb amide formation TES protection and DiBAl-H reduction 
herefore we prepared Wittig reagent 12 from α-bromo allylester 1329 and tri-n-butylphosphine which reacted satisfyingly in the oleﬁnation reaction that led to the polyketide fragment 
ompound 16 could therefore directly be used in the condensation step with alloc-protected D-phenylalanine 4 .32,33 Now the stage was set for the removal of both protecting groups allyl ester and alloc and subsequent macrocycle formation 
he desired product was obtained in 63 % yield and was transformed to antalid 1 by removing the remaining TBS group with HF-pyridine in 90 % Scheme 3 
ragment Coupling and Endgame in the Synthesis of Antalid 1 In the course of the project we used our myxobacterial crude extract LC−MS database to identify several other P . spec. which also produce antalid.12 Since we had achieved sequencing of the genome of one of the alternative antalid producers P. spumosum MSr6761 we were able to search for the respective biosynthetic gene cluster 
n line with retrobiosynthetic considerations we expected a PKS-NRPS hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster featuring a characteristic heterocyclization domain to form the thiazole moiety of antalid . 13 By using a known myxobacterial heterocyclization domain as query sequence we identiﬁed a modular PKS-NRPS cluster with the necessary modules spanning 36,889 bp Figure 2A .14 The cluster is organized in two genes antA and antB with the PKS modules located on antA and the NRPS modules on antB 
omologues of a serine proteinase inhibitor upstream to antA and an active transporterrelated protein downstream to antB may be involved in resistance and transport respectively 
t should be noted though that the peptide sequence of AntA-m3-DH has no obvious deviation in the typical motifs that would indicate an inactive domain.16 The forthcoming NRPS modules incorporate valine cysteine and phenylalanine with the cysteine of module 6 being cyclized and oxidized to form a thiazole 
ett . 2008 10 2601. data of synthetic and authentic antalid were in good agreement and thus conﬁrm the proposed structure 
n summary we have isolated and characterized the novel secondary metabolite antalid 1 from Polyangium spec . and P. spumosum Pl 4620 
orth mentioning is the fact that the macrocyclization could not be achieved by joining both the polyketide and the peptidic portion but through amide formation between both amino acids which were liberated through simultaneous allyl ester and alloc cleavage . ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT S Supporting Information The Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI 10.1021/acs.orglett.6b00810

ur statistical method calculated a score diﬀerence value of 7.2 for the conﬁguration at 3-C which is too low in order to be reliable 
he score diﬀerence value of 85.98 for the conﬁguration at 5-C however was of such a large absolute value that the D-conﬁguration could be deduced with very high conﬁdence 
ased on the D-conﬁguration of the alcohol at 5-C the statistical analysis of the conﬁguration of the methyl branch at 6-C gave a score diﬀerence value of −124.7 indicating an L- conﬁguration with very high conﬁdence 
his analysis was conﬁrmed by a crystal structure analysis which established the relative conﬁguration of all ﬁve stereogenic centers unambiguously 
espite extensive experimentation with various established macrocyclization conditions Yamaguchi,21 Shiina,22 KeckBoden,23,24 etc . we were not able to obtain the desired cyclization product 
s an alternative we envisioned to establish the macrocycle through peptide bond formation of intermediate 3 
ith respect to the biosynthesis only three PKS modules would be necessary to form the PKS subunit of antalid whereas four modules are found on AntA Figure 2B 
owever analyzing the ﬁrst ketosynthase KS reveals that the active site cysteine is substituted by a serine 
uch KS frequently decarboxylate the extender unit without actually catalyzing the condensation step SI .15 Consequently AntA-m1-KS most likely acts by decarboxylating an initially loaded methylmalonate to form the starter unit an ACP-bound propionate 
n line with this the double-AT could be a remnant of a former biosynthetic pathway version that had an elongating KS domain rather than a decarboxylating one 
iosynthesis continues with two methylmalonyl-CoA extensions to form the PKS backbone of antalid 
he dehydratase DH of module 3 is inactive as inferred from the structure of antalid 1 
n epimerase in module 7 is in agreement with the R -Phe moiety found in antalid 1 
he intriguing aspect of antalid biosynthesis is however the lack of a terminal thioesterase TE domain which releases the product 
nstead the cluster ends with a condensation C domain 
ollowing retrobiosynthetic considerations we identiﬁed the PKS-NPRS hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster by mining the genome of the antalid 1 producer P. spumosum MSr6761 for thiazole forming modules 
inally we conﬁrmed the assigned structure by total synthesis which provides antalid 1 in a longest linear sequence of 15 steps 
he GenBank accession number for the nucleotide sequence is KU245058

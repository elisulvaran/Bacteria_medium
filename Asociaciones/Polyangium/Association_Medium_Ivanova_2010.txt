ere we describe the features of this organism together with the complete genome sequence and annotation 
his is the first complete genome sequence of a member of the myxococcal suborder Nannocystineae and the 9,446,314 bp long single replicon genome with its 6,898 protein-coding and 53 RNA genes is part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project . Introduction Strain SMP-2T DSM 14365 = CIP 107738 = JCM 11303 is the type strain of the species Haliangium ochraceum and was first described in 2002 by Fudou et al . 1 
nly two other genera of marine myxobacteria each comprising one species have been described to date Plesiocystis pacifica and Enhygromyxa salina 3,4 
NSDC databases indicate as of December 2009 that members of Haliangium are very rare in the environment with the most closely related The Genomic Standards Consortium Haliangium ochraceum type strain SMP-2T 16S rRNA gene sequences from uncultured bacteria being less than 94 % similar to H. ochraceum SMP-2T . Classification and features At the time of species description of the two Haliangium species the most similar 16S rRNA gene sequence from cultivated strains originated from strain Pl vt1T 
hus Reichenbach revived Kofler ’ s “ Polyangium flavum ” in a new genus Kofleria and designated strain Pl vt1T the type strain of the species Kofleria flava 6 
he 16S rRNA gene sequences of the two Haliangium species were less than 94 % similar to this nearest neighbor 1 , and thus far no sequences of cultivated or uncultivated bacteria with higher similarities to SMP-2T were deposited in GenBank 
n 2005 the family Kofleriaceae was created by Reichenbach containing the single species K. flava 6 , and the author mentioned in a note added during the edition of Bergey ’ s Manual that he regarded the two Haliangium species as members of the family Kofleriaceae 
rom a phylogenetic point of view the genera Kofleria terrestrial and Haliangium marine should be members of a single family 
he first is their high potential to produce secondary metabolites most of them affecting prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells and hence awaiting exploitation for pharmaceutical applications or in plant protection 
hey encode genes for key enzymes in the biosynthesis of polyketide and peptide metabolites polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases respectively 9 
heir second distinctive characteristic is their morphogenesis i.e . the formation of fruiting bodies and development of myxospores that is based on cell-to-cell signaling among the single cells of the population in a swarm 
he genetic background of the so called ‘ social motility ’ and 97 morphogenesis is understood best for Myxococcus xanthus 10 
he sequences of the two 16S rRNA gene copies in the genome of do not differ from each other and do not differ from the previously published 16S rRNA sequence of DSM 14365 AB016470 
egetative cells of H. ochraceum stain Gramnegative and form cylindrical rods with blunt ends Table 1 
hey are embedded in an extracellular matrix and measure 0.5-0.6 by 3-8 µm Figure 2 
he colonies exhibit spreading on solid surfaces such as agar as filmlike layers and thus are called ‘ swarms ’ 
he fruiting bodies of strain SMP-2T are light yellow to yellowish-brown irregular sessile knobs with a diameter of 50-200 µm and contain one or more oval-shaped sporangioles each 20-60 µm in size 1,2 
he myxospores tolerate heat treatment at 55-60°C for 5 minutes and storage in a desiccated stage for at least 3 months 23 
he strain requires NaCl for growth with an optimum concentration of 2 % and good growth in the range of 0.5-4 % NaCl in agar or in liquid medium 1,2,23 
hylogenetic tree highlighting the position of H. ochraceum SMP-2T relative to the other type strains within the genus and the type strains of the other genera within the order Myxococcales 
he tree was inferred from 1,463 aligned characters 12,13 of the 16S rRNA gene sequence under the maximum likelihood criterion 14 and rooted in accordance with the current taxonomy 
ineages with type strain genome sequencing projects registered in GOLD 15 are shown in blue published genomes in bold . Cells of strain SMP-2T are strictly aerobic with weak oxidase and catalase reactions 
o hydroxylated fatty acids were detected a feature shared with members of the genera Nannocystis Sorangium 1 , Plesiocystis 4 and Enhygromyxa 3 
hile the two Haliangium species http //standardsingenomics.org also contain anteiso-branched fatty acids as distinctive compounds 1 , the specific feature of the two other marine genera Plesiocystis and Enhygromyxa is the presence of polyunsaturated C20:4 acids 3,4 
n members of the genus Nannocystis and Polyangium true steroids were detected a very unusual trait among prokaryotes 6,29 
t is noteworthy that the members of the other marine genera Plesiocystis and Enhygromyxa contain MK-8 H2 and MK-7 respectively 3,4

Genome sequencing and annotation Genome project history This organism was selected for sequencing on the basis of its phylogenetic position and is part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project 30 
he genome project is deposited in 99 the Genome OnLine Database 15 and the complete genome sequence is deposited in GenBank 
equencing finishing and annotation were performed by the DOE Joint Genome Institute JGI 
canning electron micrograph of H. ochraceum SMP-2T Genome sequencing and assembly The genome was sequenced using a combination of Sanger and 454 sequencing platforms 
ll general aspects of library construction and sequencing performed at the JGI can be found at the JGI website http //www.jgi.doe.gov/ . 454 Pyrosequencing reads were assembled using the Newbler assembler version 1.1.02.15 Roche 
arge Newbler contigs were broken into 10,273 overlapping fragments of 1,000 bp and entered into the final assembly as pseudo-reads 
he sequences were assigned quality scores based on Newbler consensus q-scores with modifications to account for overlap redundancy and to adjust inflated qscores 
total of 2,013 Sanger finishing reads were produced to close gaps to resolve repetitive regions and to raise the quality of the finished sequence 
he final assembly contains 90,757 Sanger and 689,516 pyrosequencing reads . Genome annotation Genes were identified using Prodigal 32 as part of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory genome annotation pipeline followed by a round of manual curation using the JGI GenePRIMP pipeline http //geneprimp.jgi-psf.org/ [ 33 
he predicted CDSs were translated and used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI nonredundant database UniProt TIGRFam Pfam PRIAM KEGG COG and InterPro databases 
dditional gene prediction analysis and functional annotation was performed within the Integrated Microbial Genomes Expert Review http //img.jgi.doe.gov/er platform 34 . Genome properties The genome is 9,446,314 bp long and comprises one main circular chromosome with a 69.5 % GC content Table 3 and Figure 3

he number of COG genes involved in “ Replication recombination and repair ” however are remarkably increased in H. ochraceum 439 genes were assigned to this category in S. cellulosum there are 541 whereas P. putida only contains 157 genes assigned to this category . Insights from genome sequence The genomes of two other myxobacteria M. xanthus DK1622 and S. cellulosum strain So ce56 were analyzed in depth 11,35-37 and may serve as a roadmap to explore the genome of strain SMP-2T 
ifteen of the cytoskeleton genes of SMP-2T belong to COG 5184 ’ Alpha-tubulin suppressor and related RCC1 domain-containing proteins ‘ 
train SMP-2T and P. pacifica another rare marine myxobacterium together with Salinispora arenicola are the prokaryotes with the highest degree of similarity of these genes 15 12 14 and 15 respectively 
he bacterial functional and structural homologues to the eukaryotic actin compound are the proteins MreB and ParM 39 
n contrast the sequence detected in H. ochraceum shows a striking sequence similarity to actin and is the very first report of an actin homolog in a bacterial genome 
he genomic 103 context of barP its sequence the putative structure of the protein and evidence that the gene is expressed were recently described by Wu et al . 30 
olyketide synthases PKS and nonribosomal peptide synthetases play the key role in the building pathways 37 
he sum of automatic assignments to this category is not extraordinarily increased for H. ochraceum in comparison to other bacteria 174 hits as compared to e.g. 136 in P. putida strain F1 , and the search for the gene product Standards in Genomic Sciences Ivanova et al . ‘ polyketide synthase ’ does not find any gene for H. ochraceum 
he number of hits in COG is less than 10 in bacteria except for the myxobacteria Burkholderia mallei B. pseudomallei Mycobacterium spp . and members of the Streptomyces 
ther promising fields of gene mining in H. ochraceum as a representative of the marine myxobacteria most likely are the genes of energy metabolism and the genes coding for the coordinated movement of cells during fruiting body and myxospore formation 
his morphogenesis is conducted by cell-to-cell cross-talk signal transduction and induction of ‘ social motility ’ 10,41 . We would like to gratefully acknowledge the help of Susanne Schneider DSMZ for DNA extraction and quality analysis

embers of the genus Haliangium are the first halophilic myxobacterial taxa described 
. ochraceum encodes the first actin homologue identified in a bacterial genome 
he attempt to isolate halophilic myxobacteria was initiated by the detection of myxobacterial phylotypes in marine sediments 2 
second species of the genus Haliangium H. tepidum was described along with H. ochraceum 1 
ll marine myxobacteria are phylogenetically grouped within one of the three suborders within the order Myxococcales the Nannocystineae 
his strain was published with the name Polyangium vitellinum 5 , hence the accession entry of its sequence AJ233944 was also registered with this species name up to November 2009 
owever Reichenbach perceived that these organisms meet perfectly Kofler ’ s description of “ Polyangium flavum ” but do not conform to the description of the genus Polyangium 
ubsequently the species name was changed in the Genbank entry for AJ233944 
lbeit Haliangium ochraceum is listed in the Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes 8 as member of the family “ Haliangiaceae ” that has no standing in nomenclature 
igure 1 shows the phylogenetic neighborhood of H. ochraceum SMP-2T in a 16S rRNA based tree 
his cell form is characteristic for members of the suborder Nannocystineae 6 
n aging culture plates the cells do no more spread to explore new substrates so called adventurous or A motility but also gather on specific points of the swarms to form fruiting bodies social or S motility [ 10 
he spherical to ovoid myxospores within the sporangioles measure 0.5-0.7 µm 
hus they resemble the myxospores of Nannocystis species in being very tiny 1 
orresponding to the multicellular lifestyle new agar or liquid cultures of strain SMP-2T can only be successfully started with very high inoccula

ixteen genes of strain SMP-2T were putatively assigned to the COG category ‘ Cytoskeleton ’ 
his fact suggests that the genome harbors many yet unknown genes 
uture studies will have to elucidate whether the SMP-2T sequences automatically assigned to a RCC1 domain are related to these repeats in particular 
s the genes most similar to the H. ochraceum RCC1-like proteins as determined by protein BLAST with the NCBI database derive exclusively from other myxobacteria such as P. pacifica or Stigmatella aurantiaca it seems plausible that they build a myxobacterial branch within the RCC1 superfamily

KS multidomain complexes are listed in COG 3221 in the category ‘ Secondary metabolites ’ 
owever the genome of H. ochraceum like the other myxobacteria studied contains a high number of stretches assigned to COG 3321 
he annotations in COG 3321 for H. ochraceum identify the homologues as known domains of PKS for example acyltransferases or ketoreductases or of a distinct PKS synthesizing the aglycone precursor of erythromycin B 
search for PKS in different myxobacteria using PCR unfortunately did not include H. ochraceum but it included a strain representing the second species in the genus H. tepidum 40

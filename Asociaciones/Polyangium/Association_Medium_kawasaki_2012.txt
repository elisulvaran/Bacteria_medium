n this study plant effects on the development of rhizosphere microbial communities in heterogeneously contaminated soils were assessed for three grasses ryegrass red fescue and Yorkshire fog and four legumes white clover chickpea subterranean clover and red lentil

n the contaminated rhizospheres Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria showed increased populations and there was a dramatic increase in Denitratisoma numbers suggesting that this genus may be important in rhizoremediation processes 
onclusion Our results show that Trifolium and other legumes respond to PAH-contamination stress in a systemic manner to influence the microbial diversity in their rhizospheres 
icrobial community Introduction Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs are a group of hazardous organic contaminants which are largely anthropogenic in nature and are ubiquitous in the environment especially in industrial soils Habe and Omori 2003 Johnsen et al . 2005 
ome of these compounds are known human carcinogens Schneider et al . 2002 and 16 PAHs have been prioritized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency USEPA for environmental regulation Habe and Omori 2003 
AH-contaminated soils can be remediated by a variety 170 of physical and chemical processes but microbial biodegradation is increasingly the remediation method of choice Haritash and Kaushik 2009 
ompared to more traditional bioremediation techniques such as biostimulation and bioaugmentation rhizoremediation possesses several advantages 
hese populations are supported by the plants which release 10–20 % of their photosynthate as root exudates containing sugars amino acids and proteins that serve as nutrient sources for the rhizosphere microbial community Kuiper et al . 2004 Salt et al . 1998 
urfactant-active compounds in the root exudates increase the solubility of the contaminant and make it more bioavailable to root colonizing microorganisms 
n addition the soil water flux towards the roots driven by plant transpiration provides an effective means by which the contaminant is translocated to the microbial community in the rhizosphere Child et al . 2007 , and higher PAH degradation is observed closer to the root surface Corgie et al . 2003 
n ryegrass rhizosphere removal of eight PAHs ranging from three to six aromatic rings in size was significantly higher than in unvegetated soil and the number of culturable PAH degraders was also increased Binet et al . 2000 
n alfalfa rhizosphere for example removal of anthracene was enhanced 28 % compared to the unplanted control soil and alfalfa root exudates were shown to increase the solubilization of anthracene by 50 % Kim et al . 2004 , confirming the Plant Soil 2012 358:169–182 important part that the plant plays in increasing pollutant bioavailability to the soil microbes 
oot colonizing microorganisms play a major role in the rhizoremediation process but the complex interactions that exist between plants and microbes are not fully understood Siciliano and Germida 1998 
lant root exudates contain many substrates which are chemically similar to pollutants and these substrates may act as pollutant analogues to nonspecifically enhance the rhizoremediation process Siciliano and Germida 1998 
llelopathic chemicals released by plant roots such as flavonoids and salicin are known to induce catabolic enzymes in microorganisms—these enzymes also enhance the degradation of structurally similar pollutants through cometabolic processes Wenzel 2009 
owever this is not always the case and a range of plant root extracts that enhanced growth and naphthalene degradation by the naphthalene degrader Pseudomonas fluorescens HK44 did not lead to increased specific expression of nahG encoding naphthalene dioxygenase 
n addition to the nonspecific enhancement of PAH degradation described above there may also be a specific three-way interaction between plants microorganisms and PAHs i.e . plants may utilize root colonizing microorganisms to protect themselves from PAH contamination and may actively stimulate such organisms in the rhizosphere by manipulation of exudate flux and composition 
n the presence of a chemical stressor plants may change the composition or the amount of root exudation Walton et al . 1994 and these changes may be specific drivers in enhancing pollutant degradation by altering the microbial community structure stimulating the growth of microorganisms , or increasing microbial catabolic activities 
n addition specific bacteria may themselves alter the rhizosphere microbial community indirectly by influencing plant root exudation flux Plant Soil 2012 358:169–182 171 and composition Matilla et al . 2010 Meharg and Killham 1995 Siciliano and Germida 1997 In this study we adopted a split-root model to examine the ability of a range of grass and legume species to influence the composition of the fungal and bacterial rhizosphere communities in response to PAH stress 
evelopment of total microbial communities in PAH-contaminated and uncontaminated halves of the split-rhizospheres was studied and characterized 
ignificant differences in the plant response were seen for legumes and grasses in two different soils and bacterial genera that appeared to be responding to plant PAH-stress signalling were identified

Results Impact of heterogeneous PAH contamination on the bacterial community structure of white clover rhizospheres In order to examine indirect plant-mediated effects of soil contamination on rhizosphere microbial communities we constructed a split root experiment with white clover T. repens grown in Lansdowne Farm soil and treated with either pyrene 500 μg/g soil or phenanthrene 1,000 μg/g soil under homogeneous or heterogeneous treatment conditions 
irect effects of contamination on the microbial community were investigated in the homogeneous split root systems while system effects were studied in the heterogeneous Plant Soil 2012 358:169–182 systems by assessing the rhizosphere microbial community structure of each half rhizosphere by DGGE Fig . 2a and b 
or homogeneous split-root systems the bacterial communities present in the pyrenecontaminated and uncontaminated control rhizospheres Hom-Pyr and Hom-C after 30 days were significantly different from each other p00.0016 ( Fig . 2a 
his is an expected result and the change in community structure over this time is likely to represent enrichment in the contaminated rhizosphere of microbial strains that are either pyrene-resistant or able to degrade the compound 
owever when the plant was grown in the heterogeneous split-root system one side contaminated with pyrene and the other side uncontaminated , the community structure of Het-Cpyr was significantly different from that of Hom-C p00.025 , and the microbial communities in the two halves of the heterogeneous system were much more similar to each other than to the corresponding Hom-C and Hom-Pyr controls Fig . 2a 
sing HPLC and fluorometric detection we were unable to detect plant-mediated transfer of pyrene from the Het-Pyr rhizosphere into the Het-Cpyr rhizosphere and this suggests that the effect must be an indirect one with the white clover plant itself responding to pyrene-contamination stress in a systemic manner to influence the composition of the rhizosphere bacterial community 
y contrast in split-root systems contaminated with phenanthrene the rhizosphere bacterial communities were grouped entirely by the presence or absence of the phenanthrene with Hom-Phe and Het-Phe showing significantly different communities from Hom-C and Het-Cphe Fig . 2b 
t the level of plant yield white clover also displayed a much greater level of growth inhibition in response to pyrene contamination than for phenanthrene contamination with 51 % p00.038 and 28 % p00.226 reduction in the shoot dry weights respectively n05 , suggesting that the plants were less susceptible to PAH stress from phenanthrene

hickpea subterranean clover and red lentil were cultivated using the split-root system in Lansdowne Farm soil with or without 500 μg pyrene per gram soil 
NA was extracted from the half rhizospheres and DGGE analyses were conducted to assess the rhizosphere bacterial community structures 
MDS based on the DGGE banding pattern showed that in chickpea and subterranean clover indirect PAH contamination affected the bacterial community structure of the Het-C pyr rhizospheres Fig . 2c & d since the Het-Cpyr communities were significantly different from those of Hom-C p00.0364 and 0.0106 respectively , for the two species 
n the red lentil split-root system a separation of the bacterial community structure between Het-Cpyr and Hom-C can also be seen in the NMDS plot Fig . 2e , but is not statistically significant p00.1084 ( Fig . 2e 
rowth of both chickpea and subterranean clover was significantly affected by the pyrene contamination with 27 % p00.005 n05 and 31 % p00.001 n05 reduction in their shoot dry weights respectively 
n the pyrene-contaminated bulk soil pyrene remained stable over the time period and after 30 days of soil incubation only 4.9 % had been degraded 
n the rhizospheres of chickpea subterranean clover and red lentil by contrast 16.1 % 22.1 % and 32.9 % of pyrene respectively had been degraded after 21 days of incubation 
hizospheres were harvested Plant Soil 2012 358:169–182 after 30 days and total rhizosphere DNA was extracted 
he robustness of the analytical method used was also tested in this case by conducting the community analysis with T-RFLP rather than DGGE followed by a binary analysis of the T-RFs present and ordination analysis as before with NMDS and ANOSIM 
his confirmed the result seen after growth in Lansdowne Farm soil and demonstrated that the white clover response to pyrene stress and the subsequent effect on the rhizosphere bacterial community is not specific to the soil tested 
rdination analysis NMDS/ANOSIM showed an apparent separation between the Het-Cpyr and Hom-C fungal communities Fig . 3a ITS just as it had for the corresponding bacterial communities Fig . 3a , 16S , but the difference in the fungal community structures was not statistically-significant p00.0911 
eterogeneous PAH contamination does not control the rhizosphere community structure of grass species In order to test whether the indirect PAH contamination effect observed above for legumes is also seen in other plants we conducted split-root experiments on three grass species ryegrass Lolium perenne , red fescue Festuca rubra and Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus 
t this concentration of pyrene 500 μg/g soil ryegrass growth showed a 23 % reduction in the shoot dry weight but it was not significantly inhibited p00.084 , n05 , and we postulated that the absence of an indirect PAH contamination effect might be due to insufficient inhibition of ryegrass by pyrene at this level

total of 9,052 valid sequences were obtained from Het-Pyr Het-Cpyr Hom-Pyr and Hom-C rhizosphere samples 
he most dominant bacterial group in all rhizospheres was Proteobacteria Alpha Beta Gamma and Deltaproteobacteria , which represented 55–70 % of the total bacterial community 
ncreased Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia populations were observed in Het-Pyr and Hom-Pyr suggesting that these two phyla respond directly to the pyrene contamination 
eanwhile a decrease in Gammaproteobacteria was observed in Het-Pyr and Hom-Pyr Fig . 4 , suggesting that members of this taxon have higher sensitivity to pyrene contamination than other phyla 
t the genus level Denitratisoma genotypes were enriched in the presence of pyrene and made up the most abundant genus in Het-Pyr and Hom-Pyr 
acillus appeared to respond indirectly to pyrene stress via the plant as the proportion of Bacillus sequences increased from 3 % in Hom-C to 9 % in Het-Cpyr Table 3 and members of this genus may be responding to specific metabolites released by the plant when subjected to pyrene stress . Discussion Enhanced microbial PAH degradation in plant rhizospheres has been demonstrated before , but the complex interactions between the plant and the rootcolonizing microbes that occur during the rhizoremediation process still remain unclear

ed fescue and Yorkshire fog growth was significantly affected by the pyrene contamination which resulted in 34 % p00.007 n05 and 37 % p00.016 n05 reduction in their shoot dry weights respectively 
owever phenanthrene contamination showed a greater effect on the plant growth reducing red fescue shoot dry weight by 56 % p00.001 n05 and Yorkshire fog shoot dry weight by 47 % p00.000 n05 
herefore we conducted split-root experiments on red fescue and Yorkshire fog in the Lindow soil with 1,000 μg/g soil phenanthrene contamination 
he plants were cultivated for 30 days and the rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed with T-RFLP 
lthough growth of both grass species was significantly affected by the phenanthrene contamination ordination analysis NMDS/ANOSIM showed that bacterial and fungal community structures could only be grouped by the presence or absence of phenanthrene Hom-Phe and Het-Phe were significantly different from Hom-C and Het-Cphe p < 0.05 ( Fig . 3c & d 
his result indicates that the indirect PAH contamination effect on the rhizosphere community via the plant is not observed in all plants and more work is required to delineate the range of this phenomenon .

he concept of the split-root system has been used in a wide range of studies mainly investigating plant responses to environmental biotic and abiotic stressors and for elucidating shoot-root signalling in nutrient uptake and transport 
or instance split-root systems have been applied to study the rhizodeposition of legume-derived N into the soil Schmidtke 2005 , and the suppression of nodule development on soybeans Kosslak and Bohlool 1984 
anger et al . 2010 used a split-root system to study the effect of heterogeneous hydrocarbon pollution and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi AMF colonization on bush bean growth and root morphology by contaminating one side of the split-root system with crude oil or inoculating it with AMF 
n the heterogeneous polluted condition increases in root biomass root length and foliar phosphorus content were observed compared to the homogeneous conditions 
hen white clover chickpea and subterranean clover were cultivated with pyrene contamination in one side of the split-root system the microbial population in the counterpart uncontaminated rhizosphere Het-Cpyr was significantly different from that observed when the plants were grown in homogeneous uncontaminated control conditions Hom-C ( Fig . 2a c & d Fig . 3a 
rifolium is indeed known to be able to uptake PAH to their roots but translocation to the shoots is very restricted and the concentration of PAH in the shoots is 100 times lower than in the roots Gao et al . 2008 
n our heterogeneous contaminated splitroot system we were unable to detect PAH in the uncontaminated rhizosphere and it is therefore unlikely that the change in microbial community was due to direct PAH transfer from one side of the plant to the other in the split-root system 
plausible alternative mechanism is that leguminous plants change their exudation qualitatively or quantitatively in response to the PAH stress and that this specifically influences the rhizosphere microbial community 
he composition of the root exudates was however qualitatively the same as for the control plant Muratova et al . 2009a though the activities of three oxidoreductases oxidase peroxidase , and tyrosinase were increased in the presence of phenanthrene Muratova et al . 2009b 
he composition and flux of exudate is also strongly dependent on the presence of microbes in the rhizosphere Meharg and Killham 1995 Siciliano and Germida 1997 , and these microbe-induced changes in exudate quality may also directly affect pollutant degradation in the rhizosphere 
his stimulatory effect observed for Trifolium exudates may be related to the indirect PAH-induced community shift we report in this paper since it was very much stronger for legumes than for other plant species Shaw and Burns 2004 
he effect was clearly linked to an exudate or root-debris associated factor and the authors proposed that flavonoids Plant Soil 2012 358:169–182 might play an integral role but this could not be directly confirmed 
n contrast to the results reported here the increase in 2,4-D degradation varied greatly between soil types Shaw and Burns 2005b and no change in the diversity of 2,4-D degrading rhizosphere bacteria was observed , at least at the level of the tfdA gene Shaw and Burns 2004 
hen ryegrass root exudates were added to a phenanthrene-contaminated soil the population of Gram negative bacteria possessing PAH ring hydroxylating dioxygenase genes was significantly increased compared to the same contaminated soil without addition of exudates and the diversity of the genes also differed between the exudate-treated and untreated soils Cébron et al . 2011 
his response was clearly seen in the significant differences observed between Hom-C microbial communities and Het-Cpyr communities in the heterogeneous split-root systems which suggests that the plant senses PAH contamination at Het-Pyr and releases stress response signals to modify the microbial community structure of Het-Cpyr even when there is no PAH present there 
nalysis of the bacterial communities in the white clover rhizospheres by tag-pyrosequencing Fig . 4 identified several groups of bacteria that are directly enhanced by pyrene contamination and others that are indirectly enhanced by pyrene contamination via the plant 
n the pyrene-contaminated rhizospheres HetPyr and Hom-Pyr increased Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia populations were observed Fig . 4 , indicating that these two phyla were benefiting from Plant Soil 2012 358:169–182 pyrene or pyrene degradation products 
t is not surprising that Actinobacteria were enriched in the presence of pyrene since many Mycobacterium species are well known PAH degraders and also colonize plant roots Child et al . 2007 
ycobacterium was one of the 15 commonest genera observed in Het-Pyr and Hom-Pyr rhizospheres but it was not found in the uncontaminated Het-Cpyr and Hom-C rhizospheres Table 3 
heir ecological roles remain unclear but it has previously been reported that they are negatively affected by PAH contamination and do not survive in PAH-contaminated soil Yrjälä et al . 2010 
his is contrary to our finding that Verrucomicrobia were stimulated in the presence of pyrene and also to another study which reported that PAH-contaminated soil planted with alfalfa specifically favoured the development of Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria Cébron et al . 2009 
his plant response is presumably local and not systemic since we did not observe stimulation of Verrucomicrobia in the Het-Cpyr rhizosphere 
n the pyrene-contaminated rhizospheres Het-Pyr and Hom-Pyr , the bacterial population was dominated by the Denitratisoma genus Table 3 
his genus was first reported in 2006 as the new species Denitratisoma oestradiolicum a denitrifying organism related to Azoarcus and Thauera that was isolated from activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant with 17-β-estradiol as the sole carbon source Fahrbach et al . 2006

esults In legume rhizospheres the microbial community structure in the uncontaminated part of the Responsible Editor Bernard Glick 
hizoremediation processes are driven by the native microbial community colonizing the rhizosphere Kuiper et al . 2004 , which is generally two to four orders of magnitude greater than in the surrounding bulk soil Salt et al . 1998 
arious studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of rhizoremediation in PAH-contaminated soils but the efficiency of the process varies greatly with plant species Lee et al . 2008 Siciliano et al . 2003 
he simplest explanation of these interactions is that PAH degradation in the rhizosphere is enhanced “ nonspecifically ” by the rhizosphere effect i.e . higher microbial activity in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil affords higher PAH-degradation activity Siciliano et al . 2003 
he higher naphthalene degradation rates observed were due entirely to the growth stimulation provided by the root extracts Kamath et al . 2004 
lants are known to be able to modify rhizosphere conditions depending on the environment in which they are growing 
he results suggest that legume species respond to PAH-contamination stress in a systemic manner to help determine the rhizosphere community composition under these conditions 
haracterization of critical soil parameters for the two soils including mineral nutrient content is given in Table 1 
he water content of the soil was adjusted to 35 % of water-holding capacity WHC before use by addition of sterile tap water 
nce the root system had grown sufficiently the seedling was transferred into a small plastic pot 27×27×45 mm in such a way that the root system extended from two holes approx . 10×25 mm at the bottom of the pot 
fter 10 days the split-root system was constructed by fixing the small pot containing the plant onto the middle of two larger pots 38 × 38×50 mm Fig . 1 with the roots extending into the pots on either side which contained either PAHcontaminated soil or uncontaminated soil ( Table 2 
he dominant bacterial taxa in the rhizosphere communities were identified by tag-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplification products obtained from triplicate samples 
apillary electrophoresis of the samples was carried out using an ABI 3730 automated DNA sequencer Applied Biosystems with two technical replicates for each sample University of Manchester sequencing unit 
el image analysis was carried out with the Quantity One V4.6.9 software Biorad 
his suggested that pyrene contamination of one half of the root system was able to influence microbial community development in the other half of the system 
he indirect contamination effect that was seen in the pyrene split-root systems i.e 
etCpyr significantly different from Hom-C was not observed in the phenanthrene split-root system 
his may explain the absence of the indirect contamination effect on microbial communities in phenanthrene-treated clover plants . Plant Soil 2012 358:169–182 175 a 
he plants were In order to examine the plant specificity of the effect observed in white clover split-root experiments were 176 harvested at 21 days when they reached maturity 
his confirms the effect that was seen in the white clover pyrene split-root system Fig . 2a 
s for white clover the indirect PAH contamination effect on the rhizosphere microbes is most apparent when the plant also shows a growth phenotype caused by the level of PAH applied 
yrene degradation in the legume rhizospheres was also examined using HPLC with fluorometric detection 
pecificity of the indirect PAH rhizosphere response to soil source Plant-microbe interactions are often decisively influenced by the particular soil in which the plants are grown 
o test whether the indirect PAH response observed above was a general phenomenon we performed the white clover split-root experiment in a second soil Lindow soil which was obtained from Lindow Turf Cheshire , UK 
n the split-root system set up with Lindow soil the indirect contamination effect on the rhizosphere bacterial community was once again evident Fig . 3a 16S Het-Cpyr significantly different from Hom-C p 00.0081 
he fungal community in white clover half-rhizospheres was also analyzed using T-RFLP targeting the ITS region 
nitially we tested ryegrass for the indirect PAH contamination effect by cultivating it in the splitroot system using Lindow soil with pyrene contamination 500 μg/g soil for 21 days 
-RFLP analysis of the ryegrass rhizosphere bacterial communities showed that the community structures were not affected by pyrene treatment of the other half of the plant Het-Cpyr was not significantly different from Hom-C Fig . 3b 
he split-root models were cultivated in the Lindow soil with pyrene contamination 
he phylum Proteobacteria was further sub classified into classes Plant Soil 2012 358:169–182 179 Table 3 Dominant bacterial genera found in the white clover split-root rhizospheres 
he split-root models were cultivated in the Lindow soil with pyrene contamination as appropriate 
he Het-Pyr dominant genera were identified by tag-pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene in DNA isolated directly from the rhizosphere soil 
n this study we show that legumes demonstrate considerable influence over the microbial community composition in their rhizospheres in response to PAH contamination while this effect was much less pronounced for the three grasses studied 
n this study we assessed the shift in the rhizosphere microbial population in various plant species during rhizoremediation of PAH-contaminated soils 
n principle this 180 could be explained by a transfer of contaminant from one side of the plant to the other either through capillary action or plant-mediated transfer 
similar effect also occurs in wheat with no phenanthrene transported to the shoots from the roots Li et al . 2001 
study on the effect of phenanthrene contamination on sorghum root exudation showed that when the plant was grown in a high concentration of phenanthrene 100 mg/kg the total amount of exuded compounds decreased by 78 % , due to phenanthrene damaging the root system 
imilarly the diversity of aromatic ring-cleavage genes in PAH-contaminated birch rhizospheres was double that found in the surrounding PAH-contaminated bulk soils Sipilä et al . 2008 
lants only show their responses to the contaminant when they are exposed to levels above a “ threshold concentration ” of the contaminant Muratova et al . 2009a 
n this study we confirmed that only legume species whose growth was inhibited by the PAH concentration tested showed responses to the PAH contamination by modifying their rhizosphere microbial populations 
his result provides clear experimental evidence for the importance of a three-way plant-microbe-pollutant interaction during the rhizoremediation process as suggested by Walton et al . 1994 
his may suggest that although Verrucomicrobia are inhibited by PAH contamination in the bulk soil they are stimulated by compounds that the plant releases in response to PAH stress 
ittle is yet known about this genus but a related strain with 95 % 16SrRNA gene sequence identity to Denitratisoma oestradiolicum was shown to utilize p-xylene as the sole carbon source under denitrifying conditions Rotaru et al . 2010 
ince the genus Denitratisoma was considerably enriched in our heterogeneously contaminated rhizospheres in the presence of pyrene Table 3 , this may suggest a potential of this genus for rhizoremediation applications

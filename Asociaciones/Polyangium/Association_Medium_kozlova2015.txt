n the gasolinepolluted soils the CO2 emission increased by 1.5 times due to the use of an additional carbon source 
he low difference in the CO2 emissions between the test variants can be also explained by the considerable contribution of fungi to the soil respiration 
his fact agrees with the above described changes in the CO2 emission

The continuously increasing anthropogenic impact on the environment is accompanied by entering of toxic compounds to ecosystems 
mong the priority pollutants are oil hydrocarbons and heavy metals 
he capability of humic acids to exhibit protective properties relative to soil microorganisms and plants is well known 3 7 10 
acterial–humus preparations combine the properties of humic acids and bacterial cultures 
he objective of this work is to study the effect of bacterial–humus preparations based on Gumigel Agros OBJECTS AND METHODS The studies were conducted with two bacterial– humus preparations representing a solution of potas sium humate isolated from brown coal Gumigel Agrosintez Company enriched with the following 1 a mixture of pure Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas bacterial cultures further HA + BC and 2 a complex of microorganisms HA + SC isolated from a mucky– gley soil ( Training and Experimental Soil–Ecological Center Chashnikovo Moscow State University and containing bacteria of the Bacillus Arthrobacter Rhodococcus Pseudomonas Cytophaga Myxococcus , and Aquaspirillum genera

ESULTS AND DISCUSSION The studies conducted showed that the pollution of the soils with gasoline and Pb CH3COO 2 significantly affected all the indices of the soil biological activity except for the respiration of the soil microorganisms 
nzymes of oxidoreductases catalase and dehydrogenase and hydrolases urease and phosphatase are considered in this work 
hanges in the activity of the soil enzymes catalase a dehydrogenase b , urease c , and phosphatase d . By the dehydrogenase activity , the control soil was referred to those with the medium content of this enzyme Fig . 2b 
owever in this case both the bacterial–humus prep arations and bacterial suspensions did not positively affect the enzyme activity 
hus the dehydrogenase and phosphatase activi ties turned out to be the most sensitive characteristics 
b CH3COO 2 little influ enced the catalase and urease activities but noticeably affected the dehydrogenase and phosphatase activi ties 
he use only of bacterial cultures did not positively affect the urease and phosphatase activ ities in the gasolinecontaminated soils and the urease activity in the Pb CH3COO 2 polluted soil 
hanges in nitrogen fixation and denitrification 
hanges in the activity of nitrogen fixation a and denitrification b . the bacterial–humus preparations was twice higher than that of the bacterial suspensions 
hanges in the share of Bacillus a , Pseudomo nas b , and Rhodococcus c bacteria in the structure of the saprotroph bacterial complex . the genera studied was used for the characterization of the saprotrophic bacterial complex structure accord ing to the following gradations dominants—more than 30 % of the total number of bacteria counted on the applied medium subdominants—20–30 % the group of medium abundance—10–20 % and the minor components—less than 10 % 
acte ria of the Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas genera that often are present in the preparations used for the remediation of oilpolluted soils are of a special interest 
he introduction of bacterial suspensions to the soil increased the share of Pseudomonas bacteria up to 0.9 and 2.0 % in the pure Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas cultures and in the soil microbial com plex respectively 
he variance analysis of the results was per formed to reveal what factors type of pollution appli cation of humic acids introduction and type of micro bial complex affect some characteristics of the soil biological activity 
he most sensitive characteristics of the soil biological activity turned out to be the total number of bacteria the enzyme activity and the denitrification

s com pared to the control soil the dehydrogenase activity decreased almost by 2 times it was poor in terms of the enrichment with this enzyme 
he application of the bacterial–humus preparations in the Pb CH3COO 2 polluted soil 5–6 times increased the dehydrogenase activity

he control soil was medium in terms of the urease content Fig . 2c 
he gasoline pollution decreased the urease activity by 2.5 times 
he application of the bacterial–humus preparations increased the urease activity by 2–3 times while the introduction of simple bacterial suspensions to the contaminated soil did not positively affect them 
he character of the influence of Pb CH3COO 2 on the urease activity was similar to that of catalase 
he application of bacterial suspensions as in the case with gasoline pollution did not have any significant influence 
n terms of the phosphatase content the control soil was rich Fig . 2d

hus bacteria of this group could be referred to the group of medium abundance 
he gasoline contamination exerted a less adverse effect on the development of Pseudomo nas bacteria as compared to the influence of Pb CH3COO 2 since gasoline components can be used as a substrate 
he use of the bacterial–humus preparations also promoted the increase in the pro portion of Pseudomonas bacteria 
he soil pollution less adversely affected the devel opment of Rhodococcus bacteria than that of the Pseudomonas representatives 
owever in this case the positive influence of the bacterial–humus prepara tions was also visible Fig . 5c 
he effect from using the bacterial–humus preparations was 3–5 times higher than the positive action from the application of the bacterial suspensions 
he 4 % gasoline contamina tion of the soils reduced the biomass of the cresssalad by an order of magnitude

his analysis also enables one to divide the variants into conventional groups Fig . 7 unpolluted soil contains 3 objects C HA HA + BS ; restored soil contains 10 objects BS MC HA + MC Pb + HA Pb + HA + BS Pb + MC Pb + HA + MC G + HA + BS G + MC G + HA + MC ; polluted soil contains 5 objects : Pb Pb + BS G G + HA G + BS 
hus the cluster analysis has confirmed the effi ciency of using bacterial–humus preparations for the restoration of the biological activity of contaminated soils 
he respira tion intensity by the soil microorganisms turned out to be the most resistant to soil pollution 
he type of pol lution also influenced the soil biological activity 
n all the test variants the application of the bacterial–humus prep arations had the highest positive effect on the biologi cal activity 
esults of the cluster analysis 
he gasoline contamination ten times low ered the plant biomass while Pb CH3COO 2 inhibited the growth of plants to a lesser extent 
he bacterial– humus preparations stronger increased the plant bio mass by 10–20 % than the introduction only of the bacterial suspensions 
n addition humic acids enriched with the complex of microorganisms of the mucky–gley soil accelerated the transition of plants from the vegetation stage to the flowering stage

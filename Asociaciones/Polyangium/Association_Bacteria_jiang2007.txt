n the one hand, from the soil sample we were able to isolate only ﬁve Cystobacterineae strains (two Myxococcus spp., two Corallococcus spp. and a Cystobacter sp.) using classical isolation techniques (in addition a Nannocystis sp. and a Sorangium sp. of the suborder Sorangineae were also identiﬁed)

ig. 2a is a comprehensive phylogenetic tree inferred by using all the available cultured and uncultured myxobacteria 16S rRNA gene sequences 
he most signiﬁcant characteristic of the tree in Fig. 2a is that the cultured myxobacteria represent only a small portion of the group’s diversity with respect to 16S rRNA gene sequences 
ased on the tree topologies of the cultured and uncultured myxobacteria, we suggest that the sequences recovered directly from soil by using a cultivation-independent approach cultured may represent myxobacteria which are incapable of forming fruiting bodies

etailed phylogenetic analysis of cultured and uncultured myxobacteria 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that many undescribed relatives of the myxobacteria exist in nature 
ost of the uncultured myxobacteria may represent taxa which rarely form fruiting bodies, or may lack some or all of the developmental genes needed for fruiting body formation 
n the present study, after a further molecular survey of the suborder Sorangineae in soil, we carried out a detailed phylogenetic analysis of both cultured and uncultured myxobacteria 
ur data suggest that the myxobacteria exist in nature in two forms: fruiting and nonfruiting types, which probably correspond to cultured and uncultured myxobacteria 
onstruction of a Sorangineae-enriched 16S rRNA gene library from a soil sample The total DNA surveyed for the construction of a Sorangineae-enriched 16S rRNA gene library was the same as that used in the surveying of uncultured Cystobacterineae sequences reported previously (Wu et al., 2005) 
fter a complete alignment using clustalX (version 1.83; Thompson et al., 1997), corresponding parts of 16S rRNA gene sequences from cultured and uncultured myxobacteria were used for inferring phylogenetic relation-  547  ships 
hylogenetic diversity of uncultured Sorangineae 16S rRNA gene sequences In situ colony hybridization was performed on more than 1000 clones of the Sorangineae-enriched 16S rRNA gene library 
he uncultured Sorangineae sequences in the campus garden soil exhibited a similar diversity to that of the uncultured Cystobacterineae, described previously (Wu et al., 2005) 
roup I contained 33 uncultured sequences (accounting for 44.6% of the total 74 sequences) in two diﬀerent branches, one of which included all of the reported cultured Sorangineae strains, i.e 
mong the 33 uncultured sequences, ﬁve clones (9-96, 13-17, 14-33, 208, 20-2) shared >96% similarity with the genus Sorangium, four clones (9-15, 13-73, 16-60, 21-42) were Polyangiumrelated, seven clones (9-66, 10-37, 13-5, 13-27, 14-7, 15-11, 21-33) were Byssophage-related, and the others were of unknown subgroups 
he other four groups in the suborder Sorangineae were comprised exclusively of uncultured  548  D.-M 
lthough the suborder Nannocystineae was not explored, a few uncultured Nannocystineae sequences discovered during our survey of the diversity of Cystobacterineae and Sorangineae were also characterized in this study 
omparing the phylogenies of the cultured and uncultured myxobacteria, we can see that there are many uncultured myxobacteria in nature, which are often signiﬁcantly distinct from the cultured myxobacteria in their 16S rRNA gene sequences 
y carefully comparing the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the uncultured and cultured myxobacteria, we can see that most of the sequences obtained directly from soil were not similar to those from cultivated taxa (Fig. 1; Wu et al., 2005) 
he uncultured myxobacteria may represent groups of myxobacteria that are genetically unable to form fruiting bodies

hylogeny of cultured and uncultured myxobacteria, inferred from 16S rRNA gene sequences 
hey may, however, still survive in nature, together with their fruiting ancestors, and thus form the basis for our sequences of uncultured myxobacteria 
he uncultured myxobacteria that have high sequence similarity to the cultured, fruiting myxobacteria may be those cells that are deﬁcient in the formation of fruiting bodies; whereas the uncultured myxobacteria that are distinctly diﬀerent from the cultured fruiting myxobacteria and located in unique phylogenetic linaeges may be those cells that are truly the non-fruiting myxobacteria 
he uncultured myxobacteria may be truly uncultivable, or the optimum culture conditions have not yet been established 
o isolate the uncultured but cultivable myxobacteria will require the development of new morphogenesis-independent isolation techniques. 3 
he phylogenetic analysis of the uncultured soil myxobacteria 16S rRNA gene sequences described in this paper not only supports the suggestions of Velicer et al. (1998, 2002), but also may indicate that the myxobacteria include non-fruiting types.  551  Our studies of uncultured myxobacteria in soil greatly expand the phylogenetic breadth of this group 
ultivation strategies for myxobacteria usually involve incubation of natural samples on a selective, agar-containing medium, followed by cell swarming and fruiting body formation; occasionally, fruiting bodies themselves can be collected from nature (Dawid, 2000; Reichenbach and Dworkin, 1992)

rieﬂy, the soil sample was ground with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen 
he ground soil was mixed with an extraction buﬀer (100 mM Tris–HCl; 100 mM EDTA; 100 mM sodium phosphate; 1.5 M NaCl; 1% [w/v] CTAB; pH 8.0) containing 1 mg/ml protease K, and was then subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles followed by incubation at 65 C for 2 h 
owever, these known taxa comprised only in a small part of the sequences recovered directly from soil in a cultivation-independent approach, indicating that the group is much more diverse than previously thought 
 small change in the morphogenesis-related genes may result in deﬁciencies in fruiting body formation (Guo et al., 1996; Lu et al., 2005), which then renders the myxobacteria undetectable with classical isolation techniques 
s for the taxonomy of myxobacteria, the isolated fruiting myxobacteria represent only a small fraction of the diversity of this phylogenetic group

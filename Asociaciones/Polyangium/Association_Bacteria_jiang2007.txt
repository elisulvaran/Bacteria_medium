or instance, the present suborder Sorangineae contains six genera, Haploangium (now identiﬁed as Polyangium by Reichenbach in 2004), Chondromyces, Polyangium, Sorangium and two new genera Byssophaga (a cellulose-degrading myxobacterium  546  D.-M 
iang et al. / Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 44 (2007) 545–552  initially identiﬁed by Thaxter in 1897 and rediscovered by Reichenbach in 2004) and Jahnia (Jahnia thaxteri, previously termed Polyangium thaxteri) 
he genus Nannocystis, which had been placed in the suborder Sorangineae has now been elevated to form a new suborder Nannocystineae, together with the halophilic or slightly halophilic myxobacterial strains that were recently isolated from Japanese coastal areas (Iizuka et al., 1998, 2003a,b; Fudou et al., 2002), as well as a newly renamed species Koﬂeria ﬂava (previously Polyangium vitellinum Pl vt1) (Reichenbach, 2004)

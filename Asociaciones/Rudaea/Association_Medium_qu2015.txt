ell viability tests, scanning electron microscopy analysis  24  and DNA leakage data suggested that SWCNTs protected microbes from inactivation possibly by  25  producing more bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which could create a protective  26  barrier for the microbes 
acterial community structure significantly shifted after SWCNTs  29  addition and did not recover afterwards 
t final stage, Rudaea and Mobilicoccus increased, while Burkholderia,  31  Singulisphaera, Labrys and Mucilaginibacter decreased notably 
he shifts of these dominant  32  genera may be associated with altered sludge settling, aromatic degradation and EPS production.  33  This study suggested that SWCNTs exerted protective rather than cytotoxic effects on sludge  34  microbes of phenol wastewater treatment systems and they affected the bacterial community  35  structure and diversity at test concentrations 
hey have been incorporated  41  into a diverse array of commercial products such as pharmaceuticals, optical devices, cosmetics,  42  electronics and antimicrobial coatings.1,2 With the exponential increase in manufacturing and  43  application of CNTs in nanotechnology, they will inevitably enter various environmental  44  matrices.3-6 However, the potential environmental risks are poorly understood and a  45  comprehensive investigation is needed.  INTRODUCTION  46  Cytotoxicity of CNTs to microbes has been demonstrated using pure microbial strains.7-13  47  The underlying molecular mechanisms were proposed to be the synergistic impacts of cell  48  membrane perturbation and oxidative stress 
owever, evidence has shown that CNT toxicity to  49  pure microbial strains is a poor predictor of toxicity to microbial communities.14,15 A number of  50  studies have therefore investigated the effects of CNTs on microbial communities in aquatic and  51  soil environments.16-18 For instance, Chung et al. reported that high concentrations of CNTs  52  significantly lowered biomass and some enzyme activities of microbial communities from an  53  urban soil,19,20 while Shrestha et al. suggested that soil respiration and extracellular enzyme  54  activities were not significantly affected in a sandy loam soil even in the presence of extremely  55  high concentrations of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).21 CNTs were also reported to  56  affect microbial degradation of aromatic pollutants including 2,4-dichlorophenol and  57  phenanthrene.22,23 Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the responses of microbial  58  communities to CNTs from various environments.  59  Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as important receptors and the sink of waste  60  streams, are amongst the most probable CNT recipients of industrial and domestic effluents.24 4 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Page 5 of 32  Environmental Science & Technology  61  Moreover, CNTs are being tailored to work as catalyst supports, composite filters, adsorbents  62  and antimicrobial agents in wastewater treatment processes, increasing the likelihood of contact  63  with microbial communities in activated sludges.2,25 Consequently, they may pose a risk to the  64  microbial populations and their associated functions 
n this respect, the effects of other  65  nanoparticles (Cu-, Zn-, Ag-, Al2O3-, ZnO-, TiO2-, SiO2- nanoparticles), especially Ag-  66  nanoparticles, have been extensively studied and most negatively affected waste removal  67  efficacy.26-28 Only a few studies have examined the effects of CNTs on wastewater microbial  68  communities.29-32 Luongo and Zhang found that MWCNTs inhibited the activated sludge  69  respiration in a dose-dependent manner within three hours,30 and that single-walled carbon  70  nanotubes (SWCNTs) altered the structure of the bacterial communities in the sludge systems  71  within five hours based on automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA).29 Very  72  recently, two studies also revealed that CNTs affected bacterial community structure of activated  73  sludge and its corresponding functions including methane production, nitrogen and phosphorus  74  removal.33,34 Notwithstanding, the ecological effects of CNTs on activated sludge system and  75  microbial survival are far from clear.  76  Recently, reports have demonstrated that CNTs altered the composition and structure of  77  microbial communities based on results from several culture-independent technologies including  78  ARISA, PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), multiplex-terminal restriction  79  fragment length polymorphism (M-TRFLP) and clone library analyses.18,29,35 However, these  80  methods only allowed identification of microbial populations at rather coarse taxonomic levels.  81  Current advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques have not only increased sequencing  82  depth at a lower cost, but also provided higher taxonomic resolution.36-38 Especially, the Illumina  83  MiSeq platform, which is able to achieve comparable or greater sequencing depth than related  5 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Environmental Science & Technology  Page 6 of 32  84  pyrosequencing, has been widely used to examine the phylogenetic/taxonomic diversity,  85  composition and structure of microbial communities from a variety of environments.21,39  86  In this study, we aimed to: (1) explore the impacts of SWCNTs on pollutant removal  87  efficiency in activated sludge systems, (2) investigate the microbial survival and cytotoxic  88  mechanism, (3) monitor diversity and structure shifts of microbial communities, and (4) identify  89  the dominant microorganisms susceptible to SWCNTs 
o achieve these goals, sequencing batch  90  reactors (SBRs) were constructed for treating phenol containing wastewater which were dosed  91  with 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 g/L SWCNTs 
esults demonstrated that SWCNTs played protective  92  roles for sludge microbes, and in the meantime changed the structure of sludge bacterial  93  communities.  94  6 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Page 7 of 32  Environmental Science & Technology  MATERIALS AND METHODS  95    96  SWCNTs and Activated Sludge 
ommercially available SWCNTs (>95%) were purchased  97  from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China) and were suspended in distilled water  98  using ultrasonic treatment for 30 min to obtain a better dispersion 
he reactors were 65 cm tall with an internal diameter of 8 cm and a  102  working volume of 2.5 L 
he synthetic wastewater consisted of 20 mg  104  KH2PO4/L, 90 mg NH4Cl/L, 10 mg NaCl/L, 12.5 mg MgSO4·7H2O/L, 12 mg CaCl2/L, 10 mg  105  FeSO4·7H2O/L, 785 mg glucose/L and 200 mg phenol/L 
he SBRs (n=15) were seeded with  106  activated sludge (2.57 g/L, dry weight at 105 oC), and domesticated with the synthetic  107  wastewater 
ach cycle of SBR was  108  operated for 24 h, including 2 h fill, 18 h aeration, 2 h settling, and 2 h decant 
fter 15 days of domestication, the SBRs  110  were divided into 5 groups, each receiving different concentrations of SWCNT (g/L): 0 (G1), 0.5  111  (G2), 1.5 (G3), 2.5 (G4) and 3.5 (G5) 
uring the two  112  month operation period, phenol concentrations of the influent and effluent were monitored daily,  113  and the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS), the sludge volume after 0.5 h of  114  settling (SV30), pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured every other day 
ince the system  115  was operated in good condition, and there was barely any sludge discharge during the whole  116  process, the MLSS was relatively stable during the process (Figure S1), thus the sludge retention  117  time was not considered herein 
ince activated sludge used in this study was gathered from a municipal  121  WWTPs and aerated immediately which was transparent and colorless after centrifugation, the  122  concentration of phenol was measured directly using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (V-560,  123  JASCO, Japan) 
LSS and SV30 were determined according to standard methods 
he pH and  124  DO were measured using a pH meter (S20, Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland) and a DO meter  125  (FLX310, Flow Electronic, China), respectively 
canning electron microscopy (SEM) images of  126  the SWCNTs and activated sludges were recorded using a Field Emission Scanning Electron  127  Microscope (KYKY-1000B, KYKY Technology, China) 
oncentrations of protein  134  and carbohydrate were measured using the Lowry and anthrone methods, respectively.41  135  DNA Extraction, PCR Amplification and Sequencing 
ctivated sludge samples were  136  collected at Day 1, 20, 40, 60 and 67 before sludge settling, and the genomic DNA was extracted  137  using a protocol based on Purkhold et al.42,43 DNA concentration was measured with Pico Green  138  assays using a FLUOstar OPTIMA fluorescence plate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany) 
or  139  high-throughput sequencing, the primers 515F (5’-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3’) and  140  806R (5’-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3’) were used to amplify the V4 region of the 16S  8 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Page 9 of 32  Environmental Science & Technology  141  rRNA gene.44 PCR was conducted in a 25 µL mixture containing 0.1 µL AccuPrime High  142  Fidelity Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen, USA), 2.5 µL of 10×AccuPrime PCR buffer II, 1 µL of  143  each primer (10 µM), 1 µL template DNA and 19.4 µL nuclease-free water under the following  144  conditions: 94 °C for 1 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 53 °C for 25 s, and 68 °C for 45 s; and a  145  final extension at 68 °C for 10 min 
CR products were  146  pooled, purified through QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and quantified by Pico Green  147  analysis 
fter sequencing, PhiX sequences  150  were removed and primers were trimmed (mismatch 1.5), and the paired-end reads were joined  151  using the Flash program (phredOffset 33, standard deviation of fragment lengths 20).45  152  Sequences containing ambiguous reads (N) and reads shorter than 240 bp were removed.46 The  153  resulting sequences were screened for Chimeras using UCHIME.47 Operational taxonomic units  154  (OTUs) were categorized using CD-HIT at a 97% sequence similarity threshold,48 and the  155  taxonomic assignment of OTUs was performed by RDP classifier with 50% confidence.49 The  156  above processes were performed through a pipeline (http://zhoulab5.rccc.ou.edu/) (not  157  published) 
etrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and correlation tests were calculated  158  using R v2.15.1 (http://www.r-project.org/) 
hree nonparametric tests, including multiple  159  response permutation procedure (MRPP), permutational multivariate analysis of variance  160  (Adonis), and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) were performed to test dissimilarity among  161  treatment  groups  based  on  bray-cutis  distance  index  (http://ieg.ou.edu/).  9 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Environmental Science & Technology  Page 10 of 32  162 163   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  164  Characterization of SWCNTs 
he pristine SWCNTs used here were 5-16 µm in length, and less  166  than 2 nm in diameter, with a surface area of 500-700 m2/g 
EM and TEM micrographs were  167  obtained to confirm the manufacturer’s description.40 The impact of low metal impurities (carbon  168  content > 95%) was not considered since it showed insignificant antibacterial activity on soil and  169  activated sludge communities.15,29,35 With the increasing manufacturing and application of CNTs,  170  more and more CNTs will inevitably enter WWTPs via CNT production facility’s release,  171  manufacturing and disposal of CNT containing products.4,5,50,51 CNTs released from composites  172  such as sports equipment, tires, electronics, etc. have been reported elsewhere.51 CNTs may  173  agglomerate and accumulate in activated sludge due to their high hydrophobic and  174  biodegradation-resistant characteristics.5,34 In previous reports, low concentrations of CNTs have  175  been proven to exert no or little impact on microbial and enzyme activities of soils and activated  176  sludge.19,33,35 Our preliminary experiments also showed that the microbial communities were not  177  changed with 0.1 g/L SWCNT, while a noticeable shift was observed in 2.0 g/L SWCNT group  178  using PCR-DGGE analysis (data not shown) 
cute and chronic influences of SWCNTs on  181  the phenol wastewater treatments were mimicked over a course of two months’ operation.  182  Phenol was almost completely removed after one cycle of operation in all reactors (Figure 1) 
WCNTs have been widely used as adsorbents for heavy  190  metals and aromatics removal by virtue of their unique properties.52-54 Results from this study  191  also indicated a dose-dependent relationship between phenol removal and SWCNTs, and 3.5 g/L  192  SWCNTs could adsorb 58.9% phenol (initial concentration 180 mg/L) within 6 hours (Table S1).  193  Thus, we initially speculated the elevated phenol removal rates on Day 1 and 20 were attributed  194  to phenol adsorption by SWCNTs 
t was previously proven that  196  carbon-based nanomaterials could adsorb free EPS and improve EPS production, which could  197  form a protective barrier for the microbes.12,31,34 Therefore, we determined the bound protein and  198  polysaccharide concentrations of the five groups (Figure S3), which revealed higher bound EPS  199  concentrations in SWCNTs-treated SBRs compared to the control group 
ach  204  group was performed in triplicate with different concentrations of SWCNTs (g/L): 0 (G1), 0.5  205  (G2), 1.5 (G3), 2.5 (G4) and 3.5 (G5).  206  The phenol concentration in the influent was increased to 1000 mg/L on Day 61 to  207  investigate the robustness of the constructed systems 
1 had a similar removal rate compared to  210  Day 61; G2, G3 and G4 showed higher removal rates, in which 96% phenol was removed within  211  10 hours; G5 had a considerably lower removal rate, requiring over 18 hours to achieve 88%  212  phenol removal (Figure S2) 
he percentage of  12 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Page 13 of 32  Environmental Science & Technology  218  inactivated cells in the control group was similar to G2 and was much higher than those in G3,  219  G4 and G5 
hree major cytotoxic mechanisms of CNTs have been  225  recognized in previous studies, i.e. generation of oxidative stress, release of certain impurities  226  and physical perturbation.33,34,55 The reduced cell death and high purity of SWCNTs in the  227  present study implied oxidative stress and metal purities should not be significant 
herefore, the cytotoxicity of SWCNTs on  233  sludge microbial communities was very limited and negligible

he sludge samples from Day 1, 20,  243  40, 60 and 67 were sequenced using the Illumina Miseq platform 
fter removing low quality  244  sequences and chimeras, the sequence number of each sample was rarefied to 15131, resulting in  245  226-579 OTUs at the clustering threshold of 0.97 
WCNTs addition significantly reduced Shannon diversity and  247  evenness (ANOVA P=0.027 and 0.025, respectively) on the first day (Table 1), while the  248  richness (OTU and Chao1) did not change (P>0.05) 
hereafter, the Shannon indices, OTU  249  richness and evenness were similar among all groups (P>0.05), suggesting a shock loading  250  effect upon SWCNTs addition, followed by a gradual recovery of bacterial diversity

n Day 1, more taxa were  259  positively affected than negative ones at phylum, class, genus and OTU levels, whereas the  260  opposite trend was observed at all other sampling time 
or example, the majority of  261  significantly impacted OTUs (78/106) were of lower abundances on Day 1, yet much smaller  262  fractions of those were reduced on other sampling days (32/155, 27/93, 31/98, 55/126 for day 20,  263  40, 60 and 67, respectively) 
ierarchical clustering analysis also showed that the  15 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Environmental Science & Technology  Page 16 of 32  268  triplicate samples of G1 clustered together and separated from the samples of all other groups  269  (Figure S7) 
issimilarity analyses by Adonis, ANOSIM and MRPP confirmed that G1 was  270  significantly distinct from the other samples (data not shown, P<0.01) at all time points 
CA plots of all samples showing the relationships of microbial community structures  277  among different groups at each sampling time (Day 1, 20, 40, 60 and 67) 
 distinct cluster can be defined from the samples of G1 based on  279  the DCA ordination, which suggests the differences in microbial community structures between  280  G1 and other four groups.  281  Susceptible Genera in Response to SWCNTs 
he influences of SWCNTs on dominant genera  282  (relative abundances over 1%) were further assessed at the initial (Day 1) and final (Day 60)  283  stages of SWCNTs addition 
n Day 1, there were 11 dominant genera in all groups, among  284  which only Zoogloea exhibited different abundances among groups (ANOVA, P<0.05) and it  285  did not survive at final stage (Figure S8) 
in et al. also  288  reported SWCNTs addition improved sludge settling ability by 5.7-10.8% within five hours.31  289  Species of Zoogloea (Zoogloea ramigera) were widely spread in activated sludge, and have been  290  regarded as the key populations responsible for the flocculation of activated sludges.37,56,57  291  Therefore, the increased Zoogloea upon SWCNTs addition in this study might have positively  292  influenced the sludge settling ability.  293  There were 19 dominant genera on Day 60 (Figure S10), and 7 of them showed significant  294  shifts (Figure 4) 
he relative abundance of this genus on  296  Day 67 (3.69% in G1, 11.47-26.48% in others) was similar to that of Day 60 (Figure S11).  297  Rudaea has been identified in long-term contaminated soils with biphenyl, benzoate and  298  naphthalene, as well as in a petroleum refinery wastewater treatment plant, thus it is of  17 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Environmental Science & Technology  Page 18 of 32  299  considerable potential for aromatics biodegradation.58,59 Meanwhile, it is also known for  300  cellulose degradation and was detected as the predominate and sensitive genus susceptible to  301  metal nanoparticles, especially nano-TiO2.60,61 In our study, the increase of Rudaea in SWCNTs-  302  treated groups might lead to improved aromatic (such as phenol) degradation capacity.  303  The abundances of Burkholderia, Singulisphaera, Mucilaginibacter and Labrys in  304  SWCNTs-treated groups were notably lower than that in G1 
embers of Burkholderia were  305  known to play important roles in bioremediation of recalcitrant xenobiotics, as well as  306  polyphosphate uptake and accumulation in activated sludge systems.62-64 Type strains of Labrys  307  were reported to be capable of degrading fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene and various  308  pharmaceuticals.65,66 Thus, the changes of these two bacteria might cause the fluctuation of  309  xenobiotic removal performance 
ingulisphaera was a newly established genus belonging to the  310  order  311  Mucilaginibacter including Mucilaginibacter gracilis and Mucilaginibacter paludis were also  312  proficient in degrading various biopolymers (pectin, xylan, laminarin, etc.).68 Therefore, the  313  higher abundances of Singulisphaera and Mucilaginibacter in G1 might result in relatively more  314  EPS degradation, which may explain the higher EPS concentration in SWCNTs-treated groups.  315  Mobilicoccus was another increased genus in response to SWCNTs 
t has so far only been  316  isolated from fish intestinal tracts and its ecological role in WWTPs kept unknown.69 Geothrix  317  was an anaerobic Fe(III)-reducing bacterium which usually existed in hydrocarbon-contaminated  318  matrix.70 The roles of this genus also needed further investigation.  Planctomycetales  with  biopolymers-degrading  ability.67  Certain  species  from  18 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Page 19 of 32  Environmental Science & Technology  319 320  Figure 4 
NOVA analysis was adopted and the 7 genera had  322  P<0.05.  323  Rhodanobacter was another predominant genus with relative abundance of over 10%.  324  Although it showed no significant differences among G1 to G4 (ANOVA, P>0.05), it was  325  significantly lower in G5 (7.54%) compared with G1 (16.73%) at final stage (Figure S11).  326  Rhodanobacter was reported to be capable of aromatics degradation and denitrification.71,72 The  327  decrease in abundance of this genus might negatively affect aromatic degradation and nitrogen  328  removal performance in G5.  329  Most of the previous studies only searched the shifted microbes upon SWCNTs addition at  330  one time point, yet the long-time and termly detection of community changes could bring us  331  more useful insights 
ur results revealed similar responses of Rudaea, Burkholderia, Geothrix,  332  Mobilicoccus and Labrys at any sampling time, indicating that they were more susceptible to  19 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Environmental Science & Technology  Page 20 of 32  333  SWCNTs in phenol wastewater treatment systems (Figure S11) 
owever, SWCNTs exhibited  334  varied or converse effects on some other taxa including Rhodanobacter, Singulisphaer and  335  Mucilaginibacter at different time points 
herefore, the ecological effects of SWCNTs should be  338  investigated case by case.  339  It was previously reported that high concentrations of SWCNTs could significantly reduce  340  urban soil enzyme activity and affect 2,4-dichlorophenol mineralization, possibly by inhibiting  341  the activity of soil endogenous microorganisms, whereas low concentrations of SWCNTs  342  showed no or little influence on the microbes.19,22 Based on our study, 3.5 g/L seemed to be the  343  threshold for SWCNT toxicity, above which the performance of the SBRs could be unstable  344  upon high phenol influent shock 
or controllable engineered system-bioreactors, the  345  performance and stability correlated with functional redundancy.73-75 Hence, the specific  346  contributions and interactions of the community members, and particularly the impacts of  347  SWCNTs on related functional genes need further investigation to obtain an in-depth  348  understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the SWCNT ecological effects 
ince SWCNTs  349  can significantly alter the microbial community structure, both improving and inhibiting  350  wastewater treatment system performance, application of CNTs to wastewater treatment systems  351  should be carefully considered for balancing both positive and negative effects.  352  Implications 
lthough SWCNTs were shown to be toxic to bacteria elsewhere, this study  353  showed that addition of SWCNTs to phenol wastewater treatment systems could reduce  354  cytotoxicity and increase phenol removal rates 
WCNTs addition significantly altered the composition and structure of indigenous  358  activated sludge microbial communities 
oogloea, Rudaea, Mobilicoccus, Burkholderia,  359  Singulisphaera, Labrys and Mucilaginibacter were significantly shifted which might result in  360  microbial community function fluctuations 
he high-throughput sequencing technology has  361  proven to be a feasible method for detecting subtle microbial changes resulting from CNT  362  contamination in realistic environmental matrixes, which will contribute to promoting  363  understanding of SWCNT nanoecotoxicology.  364    ASSOCIATED CONTENT  365  Supporting Information  366  This file contains Figures S1-S11 and Tables S1-S2

astewater treatment systems are potential recipients of SWCNTs  18  containing influent, yet the impacts of SWCNTs on these systems are poorly documented 
n this  19  study, the microbial responses to SWCNTs in simulated phenol wastewater treatment systems  20  were investigated 
he phenol removal rates were improved in all SWCNTs-treated sequencing  21  batch reactors during the first 20 days, but when facing higher phenol concentration (1000 mg/L)  22  after 60 days, reactors with the highest concentration (3.5 g/L) of SWCNTs exhibited a notably  23  decreased phenol removal capacity 
llumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed that the  27  bacterial diversity did not change significantly except for a minor reduction after the immediate  28  addition of SWCNTs 
ore details regarding the  99  SWCNTs have been described previously.40 Activated sludge was gathered from the secondary  100  sedimentation tank of Chunliu River WWTP (Dalian, China).  101  Experimental Design 
ine air bubbles for aeration were supplied through an air pump at the  103  reactor bottom with an airflow rate of 0.4 L/min 
he efflux DNA was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy  131  (Hitachi, Japan) using DAPI as the fluorescent dye (excitation 364, emission 454 nm) after  132  filtration through a 0.22 µm membrane 
he 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing was conducted on Illumina MiSeq platform  148  at the Institute for Environmental Genomics, University of Oklahoma.  149  Sequencing data analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons 
ytotoxicity of CNTs was closely related to the  165  physicochemical properties 
herefore, the concentrations of SWCNTs used in  179  the present study were set at a relative high level from 0.5 to 3.5 g/L.  180  Effects of SWCNTs on Reactor Performances 
n  183  the first 20 days, phenol removal rates were SWCNT-dose-dependent with the order of  184  G5>G4>G3>G2>G1 (Figure S2) 
n Day 1, the removal rate reached 96.1 ± 2.4% within two  10 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Page 11 of 32  Environmental Science & Technology  185  hours in G5, while it took eight hours for G1 to reach a similar removal rate, indicating a positive  186  influence of SWCNTs on phenol removal in this system 
herefore, despite the potential toxicity,  188  SWCNTs appeared to exhibit positive effects on sludge microbial communities, especially  189  during the early stages of operation 
ltogether, our results  200  suggested that the potential protective mechanism of SWCNTs possibly resulted from the higher  201  bound EPS production.  11 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Environmental Science & Technology  Page 12 of 32  202 203  Figure 1 
henol removal performances of each group during the 67-day operation process 
ver 94% of the phenol was removed  208  within 14 hours in all groups with slightly lower removal rate in G5 (Figure S2) 
nce past a threshold, i.e. 3.5 g/L in the present study, they could result in a  215  negative impact after a longtime interaction.  216  To determine cell survival rates upon addition of SWCNTs, cell viability tests (DAPI/PI  217  staining) was performed at each sampling time (Figure2, Figure S4) 
his phenomenon was consistent throughout the whole operation 
herefore, the  220  addition of SWCNTs at relatively high concentrations apparently lowered phenol toxicity to cells.  221  DNA leakage data also revealed a higher cell-free DNA intensity in G1, confirming the lower  222  cell membrane damage rates in the SWCNT groups (Figure S5) 
he results further confirmed  223  the positive influences of SWCNTs on the vitality of the microbial communities, which were  224  also consistent with the EPS data 
nly a few morphologically changed cells intertwined with  230  SWCNTs, indicating limited physical toxicity of SWCNTs.15,29 Meanwhile, the bound EPS  231  concentrations in SWCNTs-treated groups were higher than those of the control group, further  232  reducing the possibility of SWCNT physical toxicity 
owever, our results also  234  suggested that G5 displayed a decreased phenol removal capability after phenol shock on Day 61,  235  contrary to the results derived from microscopic observations 
ur results showed that 99.9% of the  246  sequences belonged to bacteria 
ur results  251  were in accordance with the report by Khodakovskaya et al. that CNTs did not affect soil  252  bacterial diversity after a nine-week influence,39 while Hai et al. reported that continuous 14 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Page 15 of 32  Environmental Science & Technology  253  addition of 20 mg/L MWCNTs significantly decreased bacterial diversity,33 indicating the  254  influence of CNTs on microbial diversity was inconclusive.  255  Table 1 
herefore, the short-term exposure to SWCNTs repressed the  264  growth of the majority of bacterial populations, while continuous interaction exhibited positive  265  effects.  266  DCA analysis showed that the G1 samples at all sampling time separated from the other  267  groups on a two-axes plot (Figure 3) 
he  271  changes in bacterial communities, especially the dominant populations, may lead to disturbed  272  system functions.  273  274  275  16 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Page 17 of 32  Environmental Science & Technology  276  Figure 3 
ymbols represent the  278  samples from different groups 
he SV30 values in our experiment were in the order of  286  G1 (72.8% in average)>G2 (62.4%)>G3≈G4≈G5 (50.3%) in the first 10 days, which indicated  287  that the addition of SWCNTs improved sludge settling ability (Figure S9) 
udaea, the most predominant population at final stage, remarkably increased  295  from 3.17% in G1 to 10.90-26.55% in G2-G5 (Figure 4) 
t suggested the impacts of SWCNTs were of temporal  336  relations 
nder in situ conditions, more complicated surroundings will induce disparate impacts  337  on the community members 
owever, the performance of bioreactors  355  receiving a 3.5 g/L dose of SWCNT was significantly lowered upon loading with high  20 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Page 21 of 32  Environmental Science & Technology  356  concentrations of phenol, suggesting SWCNTs also posed a potential threat to the treatment  357  systems

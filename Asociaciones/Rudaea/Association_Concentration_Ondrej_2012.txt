ther lower chlorinated PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org  1  July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e40653  Bacteria Utilizing Aromatics in Contaminated Soil  Distributions of 16 S rRNA genes in gradient fractions indicate that in case of biphenyl significant labeling was achieved on day 14, whereas on day 4 DNA was not labeled enough to be distinguished from the unlabeled control (the curves have almost the same behavior) 
 he second most abundant cluster of sequences after both 4- and 14-day incubation was identical to the Rhodanobacter cluster which dominated carbon acquisition from 13C-biphenyl 
 n addition, carbon from 13C-benzoate was acquired by populations of Azotobacter (3% and 6% sequences on day 4 and 14, respectively) and Gram-positive bacilli (2% and 7% sequences on day 4 and 14, respectively) (Table 2) 
 n day 14, the peak representing heavy DNA was much smaller compared to day 4 (Figure S1) and also many sequences detected in heavy DNA on day 14 were classified as 12C-background (Table 1) 
 hese populations thus seem to play a key role in intrinsic bioremediation of a wider variety of aromatic contaminants in the soil.

 s a sufficient amount of labeled DNA was not achieved on day 4 compared to unlabeled control, the question remains whether 13C from biphenyl was derived either directly by biphenyl degradation or indirectly via cross-feeding (possibly with benzoate as a substrate) 
 heir total amounts have decreased over the years by natural attenuation, from the firstly determined concentration of 470 mg PCBs/g soil in 1999 [35] to about 100 mg PCBs/g soil in 2008 
 he soil samples for the experiment were collected from the depth of about 0.5 m in the late summer of 2008 
 n such arrangement, the soil was left to moisturize for 3 days in order to increase bacterial activity 
 ubsequently, the soil was moisturized with 500 mL of mineral salt solution [50] 
 ottles were sealed with crimp seals with silicone septa to maintain stable atmosphere with continuous evaporation of the substrates at the beginning of the incubation. 13 C-labeled benzoate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was applied directly in mineral salt solution (500 mL, concentration 1 mg/mL) onto the soil

 heir predominance is especially obvious on day 4 
 uch a small number of sequences was expected based on data obtained from qPCR (Figure S1), which suggested there was not enough DNA labeling on day 4 
 his OTU was also detected in 13 C-biphenyl labeled DNA on day 14 but was very scarce (0.3% sequences) 
 uantification of 16 S rRNA genes in these fractions was carried out using real-time qPCR in relation to a standard curve constructed with Pseudomonas stutzeri JM300 genomic DNA, which contains 213,000 16 S rRNA gene copies per ng of genomic DNA [74] 
 he number of 16 S rRNA gene copies per ng of each genomic DNA was determined by real-time qPCR as described above

llumina MiSeq sequencing revealed that the diversity richness and structure of microbial communities were shifted under phenol shock loading especially under high phenol concentration but not under CNTs shock loading 
n response to phenol and CNTs shock loadings Rudaea Burkholderia Sphingomonas Acinetobacter Methylocystis and Thauera became dominant genera which should be involved in phenol removal 
he extensive manufacture and utilization of CNTs may lead to their release and accumulation in environment soil water air and sediment , which raises a serious concern about their potential impacts on environmental and human health ⇑ Corresponding author 
astewater treatment plants are generally used to clean the sewage from home and businesses before safely released into environment and the microbial communities of activated sludge from the biological process play a critical role in the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants Hu et al. 2012 Ma et al. 2015a Shu et al. 2015 
u et al . / Bioresource Technology 211 2016 209–215 had adverse effects on wastewater nutrient removal and they would also inhibited the activities of key enzymes such as ammonia monooxygenase nitrite oxidoreductase exopolyphosphatase and polyphosphate kinase 
n the contrary Zheng et al . 2014 found that neither the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus nor the activities of key enzymes were significantly affected by CNTs including SWCNTs and MWCNTs 
urthermore the toxicity of CNTs on microbial communities is suggested to be related with the concentration physical properties length and diameter and types of functionalization carboxylic and hydroxylic ( Goyal et al. 2010 Luongo and Zhang 2010 Oleszczuk et al. 2011 Parise et al. 2014 Kerfahi et al. 2015 
he floc architecture and original microbial community structure of activated sludge also have a profoundly influence on the behaviors and effects of CNTs Petersen et al. 2011 Ma et al. 2015b 
hus it is necessary to investigate the impacts of CNTs on activated sludge of wastewater treatment systems from different perspectives which may provide a helpful guide for the safe use and disposal of nanomaterials 
ecently with the development of high throughput metagenomic technologies it enables us to analyze the microbial community in a more comprehensive and informative way Roh et al. 2010 Zhou et al. 2015 , which can contribute to the research on ecological effects of CNTs 
n previous study five groups of sequencing batch reactors SBRs dosing with 0 0.5 1.5 2.5 and 3.5 g/L SWCNTs respectively were constructed for the treatment of phenol wastewater Qu et al. 2015 
he results showed that SWCNTs exerted protective effects on sludge microbes but they would also alter the structure and diversity of microbial community 
erein the SBRs continued to run under phenol and CNTs shock loading conditions and the long-term impacts of SWCNTs on the microbial communities of phenol wastewater treatment systems were assessed with the aid of Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology 
hemicals and activated sludge SWCNTs > 95 % were purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co. Ltd. Shenzhen China and the characteristics of the SWCNTs have been described previously Shen et al. 2013 Qu et al. , 2015 
ctivated sludge was collected from Chunliu River Wastewater Treatment Plant Dalian China . added into G4 to investigate the effects of CNTs shock loading on the performances of wastewater treatment systems and microbial communities 
he SBRs were operated with the synthetic wastewater containing 500 mg/L phenol for another 20 days and samples were taken at Day 0 1 and 20 designated as Day C0 C1 and C20 for sequencing analysis 
uring the operation process the concentrations of phenol in influent and effluent were monitored daily and the concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solid MLSS , the sludge volume after 0.5 h of settling SV30 and the pH of effluent were measured at certain days . 2.3 
nalytical methods To determine the concentrations of phenol the effluent samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min to remove suspended sludge and the supernatants were analyze using a JASCO V-560 UV–vis spectrophotometer Japan

esults and discussion 3.1 
henol removal performance of SBRs systems The 15 SBRs were operated for more than two months and the MLSS SV30 and effluent pH had no significant changes Fig 
o further investigate the effects of CNTs shock loading on wastewater treatment efficiency of SBRs G4 was chosen and inoculated with an additional dose of 2.5 g/L SWCNTs 
uring the first 10 days of operation the phenol removal efficiencies had no significant changes and remained around 99 % 
t was found that the microbial richness OTUs and Chao1 slightly increased from Day 0 to Day 20 except G1 but then significantly decreased at Day 40 ANOVA P < 0.05 ( Table 1 
ikewise both Shannon H and evenness J indices showed the similar variation as the richness indices Table 1 
hen facing CNTs shock loading the microbial richness and diversity had no significant changes upon either short-term 1 day or long-term 20 days exposure P > 0.10 ( Table 1 
o assess the overall variation of microbial communities in response to phenol and CNTs shock loading DCA analysis was performed 
hifts in microbial communities of SBRs To investigate the microbial community shifts in response to phenol and CNTs shock loading Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis was performed 
fter removing low-quality reads at least 35,700 effective sequences were obtained and normalized for each sample 
he sequences were then grouped into OTUs at a clustering threshold of 0.97 using CD-HIT method and the Chao1 Fig . 2

0 C1 and C20 represent the sampling time of Day 0 Day 1 and Day 20 respectively under CNTs shock loading conditions . 212 Y 
donis ANOSIM and MRPP showed that the community structures at Day 0 20 and 40 were significantly different from each other P < 0.05 ( Table S1 
owever the CNTs shock loading had no significant effects on microbial communities as observed from DCA plots and dissimilarity tests P > 0.10 ( Fig . 2 and Table S1 . 3.3 
t the phylum level a total of 30 phyla were detected and the majority belonged to 10 phyla which covered over 97 % of the effective sequence tags 
ther dominant phyla included Bacteroidetes 5.3–15.7 % , Acidobacteria 3.1–9.7 % and Planctomycetes 1.9–6.7 % 
otably the abundances of Proteobacteria in G1 were significantly higher P < 0.05 than those in other four groups under phenol shock loading conditions at Day 20 and Day 40 
esides the abundances of Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes in G1 were seemed to be lower than those in SWCNTstreated groups 
ithin Proteobacteria Gammaproteobacteria 11.0–36.8 % , Alphaproteobacteria 13.2–36.1 % and Bataproteobacteria 9.8–27.7 % were more abundant in all samples Fig . 3b 
he abundances of Gammaproteobacteria showed similar patterns as Proteobacteria under phenol and CNTs shock loading conditions which decreased after long-term exposure to SWCNTs Fig . 3b 
n the contrary previous study by Hai et al . 2014 indicated that MWCNTs would increase the abundances of Proteobacteria in activated sludge especially for Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria 
mong the 527 assigned genera the 10 most abundant genera in each treatment at different sampling time were used for heat map analysis and a total of 17 genera were selected for comparison Fig . 3

mong the dominant genera Zoogloea and Haliscomenobacter could be related to sludge settling properties while Rudaea Burkholderia Acinetobacter Methylocystis Thauera and Sphingomonas could play important roles in phenol degradation 
oogloea and Haliscomenobacter were widely spread in activated sludge which have been regarded as floc-forming and filamentous bacteria respectively Guo and Zhang 2012 Zhao et al. 2013 
oogloea played a key role in the flocculation of activated sludge while Haliscomenobacter could be related to sludge bulking and foaming 
nder phenol shock loading conditions the abundances of Zoogloea in SWCNTs-treated groups decreased firstly and then increased when phenol concentration was raised while the abundances of Haliscomenobacter increased in each treatment 
revious studies have indicated that genus Rudaea was detected in soil and activated sludge contaminated with aromatic compounds such as biphenyl naphthalene and phenol Uhlik et al. 2012 Qu et al. 2015 
urkholderia and Acinetobacter showed high versatility in genetic diversity and metabolic capacity which enabled them to degrade various natural and xenobiotic pollutants such as toluene phenols and polychlorobiphenyls Mahenthiralingam et al. 2005 Al-Khalid and El-Naas 2012 
ethylocystis Thauera and Sphingomonas all increased in relative abundances as the phenol concentration increased especially in SWCNTs-treated groups when phenol concentration was raised to 500 mg/L Fig . 4 
owever the CNTs shock loading would also decrease the abundances of Thauera and Sphingomonas 
revious studies have shown that Methylocystis could be used for the degradation of chlorinated aromatic compounds e.g . chlorobenzene and trichloroethylene McDonald et al. 1997 Jechorek et al. 2003 while Thauera was an important population in wastewater treatment plants Liu et al. 2006 Ma et al. 2015a which had a versatile capacity to degrade a wide spectrum of aromatic compounds such as phenol indole and toluene Shinoda et al. , 2004 Mao et al. , 2010 
phingomonas possessed extraordinary metabolic versatility which could be used to degrade a wide range of recalcitrant natural and anthropogenic compounds such as biphenyl s naphthalene s , phenols and pesticides Stolz , 2009 
herefore Methylocystis Thauera and Sphingomonas could be more responsible for the efficient removal of phenol during the operation . phenol wastewater treatment systems 
irstly SWCNTs could change the richness and diversity of microbial community 
t was noticed that the microbial richness OTU and Chao1 and diversity Shannon and evenness of SWCNTs-treated groups G2-G5 were a little higher than those of non-treated group G1 at Day 20 and Day 40 Table 1 , suggesting that SWCNTs might have protective effects against phenol 
revious studies indicated that SWCNTs could induce the microbial community to produce more extracellular polymeric substance which might protect the microbes from the toxicity of phenol Yin et al. 2009 Qu et al. 2015 , thus leading to the high level of richness and diversity in SWCNTs-treated groups 
econdly SWCNTs could alter the composition and structure of microbial community 
n previous studies although CNTs SWNCTs and MWCNTs might have positive or adverse effects on wastewater treatment efficiency they could alter the diversity and structure of microbial communities in activated sludge Goyal et al. 2010 Hai et al. 2014 Ma et al. 2015b Qu et al. 2015 
hirdly SWCNTs could affect the taxa and function of microbial community 
o discern the impact of SWCNTs on microbial community composition Pearson correlation between the abundance of different taxa and the concentration of SWCNTs was examined 
he results indicated that more taxa at the class family and genus level showed positive relationships rather than negative especially after the long-term exposure to SWCNTs Table S2 
mong the dominant genera Acinetobacter Methylocystis Thauera and Sphingomonas were reported to be capable of degrading various xenobiotic pollutants Al-Khalid and El-Naas 2012 Jechorek et al. 2003 Mao et al. 2010 Stolz 2009 
lthough the diversity and structure of microbial community had no significant changes under CNTs shock loading condition the dominant genera Acinetobacter Thauera and Sphingomonas decreased notably after the long-term exposure which might cause the fluctuations in phenol removal . 3.4

UT14YQ107 and the Open Project of State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment Harbin Institute of In previous studies CNTs in most cases exhibited adverse or no significant effects on microbial communities Hai et al. 2014 Zheng et al. 2014 Kerfahi et al. , 2015 
henol shock loading rather than CNTs shock loading would significantly affect the diversity richness and structure of microbial communities 
he dominant genera Rudaea Burkholderia Acinetobacter Methylocystis Thauera and Sphingomonas should be more responsible for the high efficiency of phenol removal

owever secondary dosing of SWCNTs in SWCNTs-treated groups would decrease the phenol removal efficiency 
nce the CNTs-containing sewage enters into wastewater treatment plants which is almost inevitable whether the CNTs would affect the microbial communities responsible for pollutants removal is worthy of attention Petersen et al. 2011 
he impacts of CNTs on microbial communities of activated sludge are gradually being studied in recent years but the roles of CNTs are still controversial 
he present study should provide insights into the understanding of SWCNTs nanotechnology . 2 
ata analysis After sequencing the data processing was conducted as described previously Ma et al. 2015a Qu et al. 2015 Zhang et al. 2015 
o additional SWCNTs were supplemented during the operation unless otherwise indicated 
o simulate phenol shock loading the SBRs were operated for 40 days with the concentrations of phenol in influent increasing from 200 mg/L 0–20 days to 500 mg/L 20–40 days 
or phenol shock loading the concentrations of phenol in influent was increased from 200 mg/L 0–20 days to 500 mg/L 20–40 days 
2 , indicating the systems were stable during the operation 
ig . 1 depicts the long-term phenol removal performances of the SBRs 
hen phenol concentration was around 200 mg/L each of the SBRs exhibited excellent phenol removal efficiencies > 98 % which was in accordance with the previous study Qu et al. , 2015 
hen phenol concentration increased to 500 mg/L the SBRs treated with different concentrations of SWCNTs maintained high efficiencies of phenol removal > 98 % , while the phenol removal efficiency of G1 declined from 98.8 % to 84.0 % over the long-term operation 
hese results suggested the positive influences of SWCNTs on phenol wastewater treatment systems under phenol shock loading conditions over the long-term operation 
owever after 20 days of exposure the phenol removal efficiencies significantly decreased < 85 % 
lthough SWCNTs could be used as the efficient absorbents for the removal of aromatics SWCNTs could not improve the absorption of phenol when added into the activated sludge since there were no differences among the autoclaved sludge systems with or without SWCNTs Qu et al. 2015 
hus the indigenous bacteria should play the most significant roles in the removal of phenol . estimator was calculated using Mothur program 
hese results indicated that high concentrations of phenol would reduce the a-diversity of microbial community due to the toxicity effects of phenol on microorganism 
s shown in Fig . 2 the communities underwent a clear 3.2

icrobial community structure analysis To identify taxonomic diversity of microbial communities from these 15 SBRs RDP identifier was employed to assign the sequence tags to different taxonomic levels from phylum to genus at 50 % threshold 
roteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all samples accounting for 58.1–81.4 % of total sequences Fig . 3a 
hile under CNTs shock loading conditions the abundances of Proteobacteria had almost no changes after 1 day of operation P > 0.10 but significantly decreased after 20 days P < 0.05 ( Fig . 3a 
he relative abundance was displayed in terms of percentage in total effective sequences in each sample from the triplicated systems 
elative abundance of the dominant genera in the SBRs 
n Day 0 the relative abundances of Zoogloea in G2-G4 were higher than that in G1 Fig . 4 suggesting that SWCNTs might have a positive effect on sludge settling ability , which was in accordance with the results of SV30 measurement Fig 
nder CNTs shock loading conditions the long-term exposure would significantly decrease the abundance of Haliscomenobacter 
he results indicated that SWCNTs might significantly affect the settling ability of activated sludge Yin et al. 2009 Hai et al. 2014 Qu et al. 2015 
he abundance of Rudaea decreased when the concentration of phenol was 500 mg/L but it would be improved after the long-term operation under CNTs shock loading conditions 
he relative abundance of Burkholderia decreased during the long-term operation while the relative abundance of Acinetobacter had a slight increase under low concentration of phenol 200 mg/L , but then decreased after long-term exposure to either high phenol concentration or CNTs shock loading Fig . 4 
CA plots showed that the communities of G1 clustered separately from other groups treated with different concentrations of SWCNTs Fig . 2 , which was further confirmed by dissimilarity tests Table S1 , suggesting the addition of SWCNTs would affect the assembly of microbial communities 
hus the higher abundances of these genera in SWCNTs-treated groups than the non-treated group might contribute to the better efficiency of phenol removal

n contrast the present study suggested that SWCNTs could have positive influences on 4 
his study should provide important information for comprehensive analysis of the environmental effects of CNTs

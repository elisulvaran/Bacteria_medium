he influent phenol concentration was increased to 1000 mg/L 7 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Environmental Science & Technology  Page 8 of 32  118  on Day 61 to compare the robustness of the control reactors with the SWCNTs-treated ones.  119  Phenol removal was monitored on Day 1, 20, 40, 60, 61 and 67 (the last day of operation).  120  Analytical Methods 
 n this respect, the effects of other  65  nanoparticles (Cu-, Zn-, Ag-, Al2O3-, ZnO-, TiO2-, SiO2- nanoparticles), especially Ag-  66  nanoparticles, have been extensively studied and most negatively affected waste removal  67  efficacy.26-28 Only a few studies have examined the effects of CNTs on wastewater microbial  68  communities.29-32 Luongo and Zhang found that MWCNTs inhibited the activated sludge  69  respiration in a dose-dependent manner within three hours,30 and that single-walled carbon  70  nanotubes (SWCNTs) altered the structure of the bacterial communities in the sludge systems  71  within five hours based on automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA).29 Very  72  recently, two studies also revealed that CNTs affected bacterial community structure of activated  73  sludge and its corresponding functions including methane production, nitrogen and phosphorus  74  removal.33,34 Notwithstanding, the ecological effects of CNTs on activated sludge system and  75  microbial survival are far from clear.  76  Recently, reports have demonstrated that CNTs altered the composition and structure of  77  microbial communities based on results from several culture-independent technologies including  78  ARISA, PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), multiplex-terminal restriction  79  fragment length polymorphism (M-TRFLP) and clone library analyses.18,29,35 However, these  80  methods only allowed identification of microbial populations at rather coarse taxonomic levels.  81  Current advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques have not only increased sequencing  82  depth at a lower cost, but also provided higher taxonomic resolution.36-38 Especially, the Illumina  83  MiSeq platform, which is able to achieve comparable or greater sequencing depth than related  5 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Environmental Science & Technology  Page 6 of 32  84  pyrosequencing, has been widely used to examine the phylogenetic/taxonomic diversity,  85  composition and structure of microbial communities from a variety of environments.21,39  86  In this study, we aimed to: (1) explore the impacts of SWCNTs on pollutant removal  87  efficiency in activated sludge systems, (2) investigate the microbial survival and cytotoxic  88  mechanism, (3) monitor diversity and structure shifts of microbial communities, and (4) identify  89  the dominant microorganisms susceptible to SWCNTs 
 ommercially available SWCNTs (>95%) were purchased  97  from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China) and were suspended in distilled water  98  using ultrasonic treatment for 30 min to obtain a better dispersion 
 he reactors were 65 cm tall with an internal diameter of 8 cm and a  102  working volume of 2.5 L

 fter 15 days of domestication, the SBRs  110  were divided into 5 groups, each receiving different concentrations of SWCNT (g/L): 0 (G1), 0.5  111  (G2), 1.5 (G3), 2.5 (G4) and 3.5 (G5) 
 uring the two  112  month operation period, phenol concentrations of the influent and effluent were monitored daily,  113  and the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS), the sludge volume after 0.5 h of  114  settling (SV30), pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured every other day 
 ince activated sludge used in this study was gathered from a municipal  121  WWTPs and aerated immediately which was transparent and colorless after centrifugation, the  122  concentration of phenol was measured directly using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (V-560,  123  JASCO, Japan) 
 he pH and  124  DO were measured using a pH meter (S20, Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland) and a DO meter  125  (FLX310, Flow Electronic, China), respectively 
 ctivated sludge samples were  136  collected at Day 1, 20, 40, 60 and 67 before sludge settling, and the genomic DNA was extracted  137  using a protocol based on Purkhold et al.42,43 DNA concentration was measured with Pico Green  138  assays using a FLUOstar OPTIMA fluorescence plate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany) 
 or  139  high-throughput sequencing, the primers 515F (5’-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3’) and  140  806R (5’-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3’) were used to amplify the V4 region of the 16S  8 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Page 9 of 32  Environmental Science & Technology  141  rRNA gene.44 PCR was conducted in a 25 µL mixture containing 0.1 µL AccuPrime High  142  Fidelity Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen, USA), 2.5 µL of 10×AccuPrime PCR buffer II, 1 µL of  143  each primer (10 µM), 1 µL template DNA and 19.4 µL nuclease-free water under the following  144  conditions: 94 °C for 1 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 20 s, 53 °C for 25 s, and 68 °C for 45 s; and a  145  final extension at 68 °C for 10 min

 WCNTs have been widely used as adsorbents for heavy  190  metals and aromatics removal by virtue of their unique properties.52-54 Results from this study  191  also indicated a dose-dependent relationship between phenol removal and SWCNTs, and 3.5 g/L  192  SWCNTs could adsorb 58.9% phenol (initial concentration 180 mg/L) within 6 hours (Table S1).  193  Thus, we initially speculated the elevated phenol removal rates on Day 1 and 20 were attributed  194  to phenol adsorption by SWCNTs 
 ach  204  group was performed in triplicate with different concentrations of SWCNTs (g/L): 0 (G1), 0.5  205  (G2), 1.5 (G3), 2.5 (G4) and 3.5 (G5).  206  The phenol concentration in the influent was increased to 1000 mg/L on Day 61 to  207  investigate the robustness of the constructed systems

 WCNTs addition significantly reduced Shannon diversity and  247  evenness (ANOVA P=0.027 and 0.025, respectively) on the first day (Table 1), while the  248  richness (OTU and Chao1) did not change (P>0.05) 
 or example, the majority of  261  significantly impacted OTUs (78/106) were of lower abundances on Day 1, yet much smaller  262  fractions of those were reduced on other sampling days (32/155, 27/93, 31/98, 55/126 for day 20,  263  40, 60 and 67, respectively) 
 ingulisphaera was a newly established genus belonging to the  310  order  311  Mucilaginibacter including Mucilaginibacter gracilis and Mucilaginibacter paludis were also  312  proficient in degrading various biopolymers (pectin, xylan, laminarin, etc.).68 Therefore, the  313  higher abundances of Singulisphaera and Mucilaginibacter in G1 might result in relatively more  314  EPS degradation, which may explain the higher EPS concentration in SWCNTs-treated groups.  315  Mobilicoccus was another increased genus in response to SWCNTs

 he phenol removal rates were improved in all SWCNTs-treated sequencing  21  batch reactors during the first 20 days, but when facing higher phenol concentration (1000 mg/L)  22  after 60 days, reactors with the highest concentration (3.5 g/L) of SWCNTs exhibited a notably  23  decreased phenol removal capacity 
 n Day 1, the removal rate reached 96.1 ± 2.4% within two  10 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Page 11 of 32  Environmental Science & Technology  185  hours in G5, while it took eight hours for G1 to reach a similar removal rate, indicating a positive  186  influence of SWCNTs on phenol removal in this system 
 ver 94% of the phenol was removed  208  within 14 hours in all groups with slightly lower removal rate in G5 (Figure S2)

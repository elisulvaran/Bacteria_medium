n this respect the effects of other 65 nanoparticles Cu- Zn- Ag- Al2O3- ZnO- TiO2- SiO2- nanoparticles especially Ag- 66 nanoparticles have been extensively studied and most negatively affected waste removal 67 efficacy.26-28 Only a few studies have examined the effects of CNTs on wastewater microbial 68 communities.29-32 Luongo and Zhang found that MWCNTs inhibited the activated sludge 69 respiration in a dose-dependent manner within three hours,30 and that single-walled carbon 70 nanotubes SWCNTs altered the structure of the bacterial communities in the sludge systems 71 within five hours based on automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis ARISA .29 Very 72 recently two studies also revealed that CNTs affected bacterial community structure of activated 73 sludge and its corresponding functions including methane production nitrogen and phosphorus 74 removal.33,34 Notwithstanding the ecological effects of CNTs on activated sludge system and 75 microbial survival are far from clear . 76 Recently reports have demonstrated that CNTs altered the composition and structure of 77 microbial communities based on results from several culture-independent technologies including 78 ARISA PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis DGGE multiplex-terminal restriction 79 fragment length polymorphism M-TRFLP and clone library analyses.18,29,35 However these 80 methods only allowed identification of microbial populations at rather coarse taxonomic levels . 81 Current advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques have not only increased sequencing 82 depth at a lower cost but also provided higher taxonomic resolution.36-38 Especially the Illumina 83 MiSeq platform which is able to achieve comparable or greater sequencing depth than related 5 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Environmental Science & Technology Page 6 of 32 84 pyrosequencing has been widely used to examine the phylogenetic/taxonomic diversity 85 composition and structure of microbial communities from a variety of environments.21,39 86 In this study we aimed to 1 explore the impacts of SWCNTs on pollutant removal 87 efficiency in activated sludge systems ( 2 investigate the microbial survival and cytotoxic 88 mechanism , ( 3 monitor diversity and structure shifts of microbial communities , and ( 4 identify 89 the dominant microorganisms susceptible to SWCNTs

 EM and TEM micrographs were 167 obtained to confirm the manufacturer ’ s description.40 The impact of low metal impurities carbon 168 content > 95 % was not considered since it showed insignificant antibacterial activity on soil and 169 activated sludge communities.15,29,35 With the increasing manufacturing and application of CNTs 170 more and more CNTs will inevitably enter WWTPs via CNT production facility ’ s release 171 manufacturing and disposal of CNT containing products.4,5,50,51 CNTs released from composites 172 such as sports equipment tires electronics etc . have been reported elsewhere.51 CNTs may 173 agglomerate and accumulate in activated sludge due to their high hydrophobic and 174 biodegradation-resistant characteristics.5,34 In previous reports low concentrations of CNTs have 175 been proven to exert no or little impact on microbial and enzyme activities of soils and activated 176 sludge.19,33,35 Our preliminary experiments also showed that the microbial communities were not 177 changed with 0.1 g/L SWCNT while a noticeable shift was observed in 2.0 g/L SWCNT group 178 using PCR-DGGE analysis data not shown 
 WCNTs have been widely used as adsorbents for heavy 190 metals and aromatics removal by virtue of their unique properties.52-54 Results from this study 191 also indicated a dose-dependent relationship between phenol removal and SWCNTs and 3.5 g/L 192 SWCNTs could adsorb 58.9 % phenol initial concentration 180 mg/L within 6 hours Table S1 . 193 Thus we initially speculated the elevated phenol removal rates on Day 1 and 20 were attributed 194 to phenol adsorption by SWCNTs

 WCNTs addition significantly reduced Shannon diversity and 247 evenness ANOVA P=0.027 and 0.025 respectively on the first day Table 1 , while the 248 richness OTU and Chao1 did not change P > 0.05 
 or example the majority of 261 significantly impacted OTUs 78/106 were of lower abundances on Day 1 yet much smaller 262 fractions of those were reduced on other sampling days 32/155 27/93 31/98 55/126 for day 20 263 40 60 and 67 respectively 
 he influences of SWCNTs on dominant genera 282 relative abundances over 1 % were further assessed at the initial Day 1 and final Day 60 283 stages of SWCNTs addition 
 in et al . also 288 reported SWCNTs addition improved sludge settling ability by 5.7-10.8 % within five hours.31 289 Species of Zoogloea Zoogloea ramigera were widely spread in activated sludge and have been 290 regarded as the key populations responsible for the flocculation of activated sludges.37,56,57 291 Therefore the increased Zoogloea upon SWCNTs addition in this study might have positively 292 influenced the sludge settling ability . 293 There were 19 dominant genera on Day 60 Figure S10 , and 7 of them showed significant 294 shifts Figure 4 
 he relative abundance of this genus on 296 Day 67 3.69 % in G1 11.47-26.48 % in others was similar to that of Day 60 Figure S11 . 297 Rudaea has been identified in long-term contaminated soils with biphenyl benzoate and 298 naphthalene as well as in a petroleum refinery wastewater treatment plant thus it is of 17 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Environmental Science & Technology Page 18 of 32 299 considerable potential for aromatics biodegradation.58,59 Meanwhile it is also known for 300 cellulose degradation and was detected as the predominate and sensitive genus susceptible to 301 metal nanoparticles especially nano-TiO2.60,61 In our study the increase of Rudaea in SWCNTs- 302 treated groups might lead to improved aromatic such as phenol degradation capacity . 303 The abundances of Burkholderia Singulisphaera Mucilaginibacter and Labrys in 304 SWCNTs-treated groups were notably lower than that in G1 
 ingulisphaera was a newly established genus belonging to the 310 order 311 Mucilaginibacter including Mucilaginibacter gracilis and Mucilaginibacter paludis were also 312 proficient in degrading various biopolymers pectin xylan laminarin etc . .68 Therefore the 313 higher abundances of Singulisphaera and Mucilaginibacter in G1 might result in relatively more 314 EPS degradation which may explain the higher EPS concentration in SWCNTs-treated groups . 315 Mobilicoccus was another increased genus in response to SWCNTs 
 NOVA analysis was adopted and the 7 genera had 322 P < 0.05 . 323 Rhodanobacter was another predominant genus with relative abundance of over 10 % . 324 Although it showed no significant differences among G1 to G4 ANOVA P > 0.05 it was 325 significantly lower in G5 7.54 % compared with G1 16.73 % at final stage Figure S11 . 326 Rhodanobacter was reported to be capable of aromatics degradation and denitrification.71,72 The 327 decrease in abundance of this genus might negatively affect aromatic degradation and nitrogen 328 removal performance in G5 . 329 Most of the previous studies only searched the shifted microbes upon SWCNTs addition at 330 one time point , yet the long-time and termly detection of community changes could bring us 331 more useful insights

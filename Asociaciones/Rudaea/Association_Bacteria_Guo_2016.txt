ultivariate analysis revealed that Gemmatimonas Rudaea Spingomonas Pseudomonas Dyella Burkholderia Clostridium Pseudolabrys Arcicella and Bacillus were correlated with SOC and cellulolytic bacteria Burkholderia Pseudomonas Clostridium Rudaea and Bacillus and Gemmationas explained 55.3 % and 12.4 % of the variance in SOC respectively 
ur results suggest that Burkholderia Pseudomonas Clostridium Rudaea Bacillus and Gemmationas help to regulate SOC sequestration in topsoil under tillage and residue systems 
ompared with CT treatments NT treatments had significantly greater abundance of Gemmatimonas Rudaea Sphingomonas Caulobacter Dokdonella Telmatospirillum Pseudomonas Burkholderia Pseudolabrys Blastochloris and Bacillus 
ompared with NS treatments S treatments had significantly higher abundance of Gemmatimonas Rudaea Sphingomonas Dokdonella Rhodanobacter Mycobacterium Nitrospira Gemmata Schlesneria Pseudomonas Pirellula Burkholderia Clostridium Pseudolabrys Blastochloris Arcicella and Bacillus 
oreover SOC was positively correlated with the abundance of Burkholderia Pseudomonas Clostridium Rudaea Gemmatimonas and Bacillus 
emmatimonas Rudaea Spingomonas Pseudomonas Dyella Burkholderia Clostridium Pseudolabrys Arcicella and Bacillus were significantly related to SOC Table 3 . Relative importance analysis 
seudomonas Rudaea Bacillus Gemmatimonas Burkholderia and Clostridium were the main influencing factors to SOC which together explained 75.6 % of the variances 
n Fig . 5a1 a2 tillage and straw systems had different levels of MUFA/ STFA and G+/G− and thus likely affected SOC directly and indirectly through the presence of 5 kinds of cellulolytic bacteria Pseudomonas Rudaea Bacillus Burkholderia and Clostridium and Gemmatimonas . Discussion This study investigated the effects of tillage practices and straw-returning methods on soil bacterial communities and their relation to SOC after a 2-year rice-wheat cropping cycle in central China

ur results showed that there were seven predominant bacterial genera Gemmatimonas Rudaea Caulobacter Sphingomonas Dokdonella Rhodanobacter and Mycobacterium in the 0–5 cm soil layer which accounted for 67.7 % of total bacterial abundance Fig . 2 
ultiple analysis results showed that soil bacterial communities were closely related to SOC and Pseudomonas Rudaea Bacillus Gemmatimonas Burkholderia and Clostridium greatly contributed to SOC together explaining 75.6 % of the variances in SOC 
seudomonas Rudaea Bacillus Clostridium Burkholderia and Dyella belong to cellulolytic bacteria32 and together explained 66.3 % of the variances in SOC suggesting that SOC is mainly regulated by these six cellulolytic bacteria 
he results of this study suggest that tillage changes the habitats for Pseudomonas Rudaea Bacillus Burkholderia Della and Clostridium and then changes the decomposition process of residue thus affecting SOC in the 0–5 cm soil layer 
tepwise regression analysis and relative influence analysis indicated that Gemmatimonas Rudaea Spingomonas Pseudomonas Dyella Burkholderia Clostridium Pseudolabrys Arcicella and Bacillus are positively correlated with SOC 
EM results further suggested that NT and S practices specifically increase the abundance of 5 kinds of cellulolytic bacteria Burkholderia Pseudomonas Clostridium Rudaea and Bacillus and Gemmatimonas in the upper soil layer likely promoting SOC levels 
he initial model comprised eight predictors tillage systems Tillage straw systems Straw monounsaturated fatty acids/saturated fatty acids MUFA/STFA gram-positive bacteria/gram-negative bacteria G+/G− dissolved organic carbon DOC microbial biomass carbon MBC , soil organic carbon SOC , and key genera of the soil bacterial communities Pseudomonas , Rudaea , Bacillus , Burkholderia , Clostridium , and Gemmatimonas picked by stepwise regression analyses , which greatly contributed to the SOC

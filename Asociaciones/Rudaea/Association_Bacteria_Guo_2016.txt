fter two cycles of annual rice-wheat rotation, compared with CT treatments, NT treatments generally had significantly more bacterial genera and monounsaturated fatty acids/ saturated fatty acids (MUFA/STFA), but a decreased gram-positive bacteria/gram-negative bacteria ratio (G+/G−) 
 treatments had significantly more bacterial genera and MUFA/STFA, but had decreased G+/G− compared with NS treatments 
ultivariate analysis revealed that Gemmatimonas, Rudaea, Spingomonas, Pseudomonas, Dyella, Burkholderia, Clostridium, Pseudolabrys, Arcicella and Bacillus were correlated with SOC, and cellulolytic bacteria (Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Rudaea and Bacillus) and Gemmationas explained 55.3% and 12.4% of the variance in SOC, respectively 
tructural equation modeling further indicated that tillage and residue managements affected SOC directly and indirectly through these cellulolytic bacteria and Gemmationas 
ur results suggest that Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Rudaea, Bacillus and Gemmationas help to regulate SOC sequestration in topsoil under tillage and residue systems 
oil organic C (SOC) is the main source of energy for soil microorganisms1,2 and SOC content profoundly affects soil properties, including aggregate stability, soil moisture and nutrient cycling3 
hus, SOC plays an important role in maintaining long-term sustainability of agro-ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles4 
OC is regulated by many factors, such as tillage practices1, residue management5, soil aggregate sizes6, and microbial functional diversity2 
ntensive and continuous soil tilling has been practiced for thousands of years in China5 
requent soil disturbance by intensive conventional tillage (CT) reduces soil aggregate sizes, thereby accelerating SOC oxidation8 and decreasing SOC content 
oreover, crop residue burning or removing, a common farming practice, reduces the amount of organic substances retained in the soil and the water storage capacity of the entire soil9, and decreases soil microbial biomass and functional diversity2 
n contrast, no-tillage (NT) and straw returning (S) may enhance SOC content in agricultural ecosystems and facilitate sustainable agricultural production5,7

illage practices and straw-returning methods affect the activity and community structure of soil microorganisms by changing the habitat characteristics for soil microorganisms such as soil porosity, soil moisture and the substrates for soil microorganisms16, thus affecting SOC dynamics in soil ecosystem 
n rice-wheat system, the field is long-term flooded and is mostly under anaerobic conditions during rice growing period19, which thus inhibits the growth of fungi and reduces the contributions of fungi to SOC 
ome studies reported that bacteria are dominant in rice-wheat system7, which may be due to their ability to break down labile carbon sources more efficiently than other microorganisms, such as fungi20, thus contributing to the increase of SOC concentration through the binding of fresh and labile pools of organic matter with microaggregates to form macroaggregates21 
ost of previous studies focused on the effects of tillage practices and straw-returning methods on soil bacterial abundance, and consistently showed that both NT and S practices can increase soil bacterial abundance7,22 
or example, Guo et al.7 reported higher soil bacterial abundance under NT and S treatments than under CT and NS treatments, respectively, possibly because both NT and S practices provide more favorable environmental conditions for soil microorganisms23 
owever, these studies ignored the relationships between soil bacterial communities and SOC 
hang et al.6 investigated the contribution of soil biota (including bacteria) to C sequestration under different tillage practices, and showed that microbial communities controlled C storage both directly and indirectly through MBC and soil bacteria contributed to C sequestration both in <​1 mm and >​1 mm soil aggregates 
uo et al.1 reported the relationships between microbial metabolic characteristics and SOC within aggregates under different tillage practices and straw-returning methods, and indicated that the increased SOC in aggregates in the topsoil under NT and S practices was possibly due to the improvement of microbial metabolic activities 
evertheless, the mechanism by which different functional genera of soil bacteria are linked to SOC sequestration under different tillage practices and their relative contributions remain unknown 
herefore, further investigation is needed to understand the relative contributions of soil bacterial communities to SOC and how these relationships may vary under different tillage practices 
owever, the sustainability of rice-wheat cropping system is negatively affected by issues such as soil degradation, air pollution25 and the long-term use of conventional management practices, such as crop residue removing or burning, or intensive soil tilling7 
ice-wheat cropping system is the most important cropping system in central China26, occupying about 20% of the total sown area in central China and accounting for about 22% of the national grain yield for these two crops in 201127 
he effects of tillage practices and straw-returning methods on soil physical-chemical properties, soil nutrient and crop yield under rice-wheat cropping system in this region have been well elucidated23,26 
owever, little attention has been paid to the relationships between bacterial communities and SOC under different tillage practices and straw-returning methods in this region 
T and CT) and straw returning methods (i.e. crop residue removal (S) and returning (NS)) on topsoil bacterial communities and their relationships with SOC under rice-wheat cropping system in central China 
e hypothesized that (1) NT and S practices can improve soil bacterial abundance mainly due to the improvement of soil nutrition condition in the topsoil layer, and (2) the bacterial communities can have positive effects on SOC under NT and S practices 
fter a 2-year cropping cycle, NT and S practices significantly affected the composition of soil microbial communities in the 0–5 cm soil layer 
ompared with CT and NS treatments, NT and S treatments had significantly higher total PLFAs, bacterial PLFA, gram-positive bacterial PLFA, gram-negative bacterial PLFA and MUFA/STFA, and significantly lower G+/G− (Table 1 and Supplementary information) 
elationships between PLFA and SOC fractions 
oreover, SOC was the most closely related to G+/G− and MUFA/STFA 
n general, NT treatments had significantly greater bacterial abundance compared with CT treatments, and S treatments had significantly higher bacterial abundance of 11 main soil genera compared with NS treatments (Fig. 2, Table 2 and Supplementary information) 
ompared with CT treatments, NT treatments had significantly greater abundance of Gemmatimonas, Rudaea, Sphingomonas, Caulobacter, Dokdonella, Telmatospirillum, Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Pseudolabrys, Blastochloris, and Bacillus 
ompared with NS treatments, S treatments had significantly higher abundance of Gemmatimonas, Rudaea, Sphingomonas, Dokdonella, Rhodanobacter, Mycobacterium, Nitrospira, Gemmata, Schlesneria, Pseudomonas, Pirellula, Burkholderia, Clostridium, Pseudolabrys, Blastochloris, Arcicella and Bacillus

oreover, SOC was positively correlated with the abundance of Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Rudaea, Gemmatimonas and Bacillus 
emmatimonas, Rudaea, Spingomonas, Pseudomonas, Dyella, Burkholderia, Clostridium, Pseudolabrys, Arcicella and Bacillus were significantly related to SOC (Table 3).  Relative importance analysis 
seudomonas, Rudaea, Bacillus, Gemmatimonas, Burkholderia and Clostridium were the main influencing factors to SOC, which together explained 75.6% of the variances 
inks between soil bacterial communities and SOC 
n Fig. 5a1,a2, tillage and straw systems had different levels of MUFA/ STFA and G+/G−, and thus likely affected SOC directly and indirectly through the presence of 5 kinds of cellulolytic bacteria (Pseudomonas, Rudaea, Bacillus, Burkholderia and Clostridium) and Gemmatimonas.  Discussion  This study investigated the effects of tillage practices and straw-returning methods on soil bacterial communities and their relation to SOC after a 2-year rice-wheat cropping cycle in central China 
he results supported our hypotheses that NT and S practices increase the abundance of bacterial genera in the topsoil bacterial communities, and that the composition of the bacterial community is correlated with SOC.  Effects of tillage practices and straw returning methods on soil bacterial community.  NT and S practices generally increased the abundance, activity and diversity of soil microbial communities in the topsoil layer2,28,29, probably because NT minimizes soil disturbance and S contributes to greater accumulation of crop residues on the soil surface8, thus improving soil nutrition condition for soil microbial communities7

traw, straw systems; DOC, dissolved organic C; MBC, microbial biomass C; SOC, soil organic C.  reported that NT could significantly increase soil N, organic C and SOC fractions compared with CT, whereas CT could negatively affect soil microbial biomass and SOC 
traw returning, as an input of organic residues to improve soil nutrition condition, can increase soil surface residue C and SOC7 and provide energy sources for soil microbes, thus enhancing soil microbial biomass2,7 
esidue amendment improves soil moisture and temperature and promotes soil aggregation, thus boosting microbial growth20, which is supported by the result of lower G+/G− under S treatments than under NS treatments (Table 1) 
owever, in the study of the impacts of residue management on soil properties and soil microbial community structure, Wang et al.33 did not find significant differences in bacterial abundance between S and NS treatments 
his result indicates that soils under S treatments may have greater gas permeability32, possibly because straw returning decreases the sensitivity to surface sealing34 and increases the porosity of the top soil layer35 
ood soil gas permeability and enrichment of organic matter in soil surface under NT and S practices7,8 also promote the decomposition of exogenous crop straw, thus improving soil nutrition condition 
herefore, NT and S practices improve soil nutrition, leading to the increase of soil bacterial abundance in the topsoil layer.  Relationships between soil bacterial communities and SOC 
ur results showed that there were seven predominant bacterial genera (Gemmatimonas, Rudaea, Caulobacter, Sphingomonas, Dokdonella, Rhodanobacter and Mycobacterium) in the 0–5 cm soil layer, which accounted for 67.7% of total bacterial abundance (Fig. 2) 
ultiple analysis results showed that soil bacterial communities were closely related to SOC, and Pseudomonas, Rudaea, Bacillus, Gemmatimonas, Burkholderia and Clostridium greatly contributed to SOC, together explaining 75.6% of the variances in SOC 
seudomonas, Rudaea, Bacillus, Clostridium, Burkholderia and Dyella belong to cellulolytic bacteria32, and together explained 66.3% of the variances in SOC, suggesting that SOC is mainly regulated by these six cellulolytic bacteria 
any studies have indicated that Clostridium, one of important cellulolytic anaerobic bacterial genera38, is highly efficient in degrading cellulose36,39 because it excretes several kinds of enzymes including cellulase and hemicellulase40 
n the present study, NT and S treatments had significantly greater Clostridium abundance (Fig. 2) 
ultiple analyses suggested that Clostridium may play important roles in SOC (Figs 1, 2, 3 and 4) 
lostridium is negatively affected by greater oxygen availability in the soil and soil Scientific Reports | 6:33155 | DOI: 10.1038/srep33155  6  www.nature.com/scientificreports/ disturbance8 
ence, its high abundance under NT and S treatments was not unexpected as it is likely that the higher residue mulching under S practice and/or less soil disturbance under NT1,7 create anaerobic zones in the surface soil 
emmatimonas (22.6%, 245 OTUs) is the most abundant bacterial genera in this study (Fig. 2), and explained 12.4% of the variances in SOC (Fig. 4) 
he SEM also showed the key function of Gemmatimonas to SOC sequestration under NT and S practices in this study (Fig. 5) 
he reason may be that Gemmatimonas can use the metabolic products as sole C sources41, such as acetate and propionate42–44, but most of other bacterial genera, such as Bellilinea45 and Sphingomonas46 (Fig. 2), cannot or can only weakly use the metabolic products of cellulose 
he SEM further showed that Gemmatimonas plays an important role in SOC dynamics (Fig. 5), which can be attributed to the fact that Gemmatimonas can reduce the metabolic products of cellulose41 and thus indirectly promotes the degrading process of cellulose 
illage practices and straw returning methods affect the activity and structure of soil microorganisms by changing the habitat characteristics for soil microorganisms such as soil gas permeability and the substrates for soil microorganisms16,33, thus affecting SOC 
oth NT and S practices promote the accumulation of straw on the soil surface, in which the major component is cellulose47, thus improving soil physical conditions21 and also providing C sources (specifically cellulose) for cellulolytic bacteria36 
herefore, NT and S practices promoted the growth of cellulolytic bacteria (Fig. 2), thus increasing the decomposition of cellulose and subsequently the SOC (Figs 2, 3, 4 and 5 and Table 3) 
ecomposition of exogenous crop straw provides C sources for other soil microorganisms, and therefore increases soil microbial biomass48, which contributes to the developing and increasing of soil organic matter2,6 
in et al.49 also reported that bacteria play critical roles in the production of soil aggregates and the conversion of plant residue to soil organic matter 
he results of this study suggest that tillage changes the habitats for Pseudomonas, Rudaea, Bacillus, Burkholderia, Della and Clostridium, and then changes the decomposition process of residue, thus affecting SOC in the 0–5 cm soil layer 
his study indicates that after two cycles of rice-wheat rotation, NT and S practices promote SOC in the 0–5 cm soil layer presumably by increasing the abundance of bacterial genera 
edundancy analysis showed a close relationship between SOC levels and the abundance of specific bacterial genera in the soil community 
tepwise regression analysis and relative influence analysis indicated that Gemmatimonas, Rudaea, Spingomonas, Pseudomonas, Dyella, Burkholderia, Clostridium, Pseudolabrys, Arcicella and Bacillus are positively correlated with SOC 
EM results further suggested that NT and S practices specifically increase the abundance of 5 kinds of cellulolytic bacteria (Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Rudaea, and Bacillus) and Gemmatimonas in the upper soil layer, likely promoting SOC levels 
owever, the mediation of bacterial communities on SOC under long-term NT and S practices in the rice-wheat cropping system should be further discussed 
ong-term (5+​years) NT and S practices may change SOC in the whole plough layer (0–20 cm); however, the ability of bacterial communities to regulate these effects remains unclear 
herefore, further studies should be conducted to reveal the mechanism of the effects of long-term NT and S practices on soil bacterial communities and their contributions to SOC in the whole plow layer.  Methods  Experimental site.  The study site was located at an experimental farm of Huazhong Agricultural University Research (29°51′N ​ , 115°33′​E) in the town of Huaqiao Town, Wuxue City, Hubei Province, China, which has been described by Guo et al.2

ll bacterial genera could explain 86.6% of the variances in SOC (Fig. 4) 
EM revealed that the predictors explained 75.0–  84.0% of the variances in SOC (Fig. 5) 
ower G+/G− ratio under NT treatments compared with under CT treatments (Table 1) suggests that nutrients are rich in the topsoil layer under NT treatments, which demonstrates the improvement of soil environment for microorganisms under NT7 
axonomy of soil bacterial communities determined in the present study 
rrow thickness represents the magnitude of the path coefficient 
alues associated with solid arrows represent the path coefficients 
oreover, a greater MUFA/STFA ratio in NT treatments compared with in CT treatments (Table 1) suggests that NT treatments may improve soil gas permeability as suggested by Bossio et al.32, because of the accumulation of crop residues on the soil surface under NT8 
ellulose is unavailable to most soil microorganisms because the crystallinity of cellulose is extremely recalcitrant for enzymatic degradation36 
ome studies have suggested that cellulolytic bacteria help to regulate the C cycle37 because they play an important role in the decomposition of plant residues in the soil ecosystem36 
n this study, most of the cellulolytic bacteria screened by stepwise regression analysis are aerobic microorganisms (Table 3), which can be attributed to the high permeability in the 0–5 cm soil layer35 
owever, exogenous organic matter from broken down cellulose promotes C sequestration in soil aggregates, especially in >​250 μ​m aggregates because the broken down exogenous organic matter could be bound to the walls of the mineral particles that surround them2,21

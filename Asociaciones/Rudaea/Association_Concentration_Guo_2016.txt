ommercial compound fertilizer (15% N, 15% P2O5, and 15% K2O), urea (46% N), single superphosphate (12% P2O5), and potassium chloride (60% K2O) were used to provide 180 kg N ha−1, 90 kg P2O5 ha−1, and 180 kg K2O ha−1 during the rice-growing seasons, and 144 kg N ha−1, 72 kg P2O5 ha−1, and 144 kg K2O ha−1 during the wheat-growing season 
 edundancy analysis showed that the coordinates from the first two ordination axes explained 89.4% (the first axis 89.3% and the second 0.1%) of the variances (Fig. 1)

 ome studies reported that bacteria are dominant in rice-wheat system7, which may be due to their ability to break down labile carbon sources more efficiently than other microorganisms, such as fungi20, thus contributing to the increase of SOC concentration through the binding of fresh and labile pools of organic matter with microaggregates to form macroaggregates21 
 he experimental soil (0–20 cm depth) has a pH of 4.79, an organic C content of 16.89 g kg−1, a total nitrogen (N) content of 2.20 g kg−1, a total phosphorus (P) content of 0.45 g kg−1, and a bulk density of 1.21 g cm−3 
 oils were sieved through a 5 mm screen for uniformity, and stored at −​20 °C, and all determinations were finished within two weeks 
 he concentration and quality (A260/A280) of the soil DNA were measured by a NanoDrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE, USA) 
 he DNA of each sample was diluted 50-fold and stored at −​20 °C, and all determinations were completed within two weeks 
 ach sample was amplified in triplicate in a 25 μ​l reaction and the program was as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 4 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 30 s), annealing (55 °C for 45 s), extension (72 °C for 1 min), and a final elongation step for 8 min at 72 °C 
 herefore, bacteria may have greater contributions to SOC concentration than fungi in the rice-wheat system 
 ice-wheat cropping system, which occupies a total area of 4.5 million ha in China, possesses important functions in food security in the world24

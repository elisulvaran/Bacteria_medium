 ultivariate analysis revealed that Gemmatimonas Rudaea Spingomonas Pseudomonas Dyella Burkholderia Clostridium Pseudolabrys Arcicella and Bacillus were correlated with SOC and cellulolytic bacteria Burkholderia Pseudomonas Clostridium Rudaea and Bacillus and Gemmationas explained 55.3 % and 12.4 % of the variance in SOC respectively 
 ome studies reported that bacteria are dominant in rice-wheat system7 which may be due to their ability to break down labile carbon sources more efficiently than other microorganisms such as fungi20 thus contributing to the increase of SOC concentration through the binding of fresh and labile pools of organic matter with microaggregates to form macroaggregates21 
 ice-wheat cropping system is the most important cropping system in central China26 occupying about 20 % of the total sown area in central China and accounting for about 22 % of the national grain yield for these two crops in 201127

 seudomonas Rudaea Bacillus Gemmatimonas Burkholderia and Clostridium were the main influencing factors to SOC which together explained 75.6 % of the variances 
 ur results showed that there were seven predominant bacterial genera Gemmatimonas Rudaea Caulobacter Sphingomonas Dokdonella Rhodanobacter and Mycobacterium in the 0–5 cm soil layer which accounted for 67.7 % of total bacterial abundance Fig . 2 
 ultiple analysis results showed that soil bacterial communities were closely related to SOC and Pseudomonas Rudaea Bacillus Gemmatimonas Burkholderia and Clostridium greatly contributed to SOC together explaining 75.6 % of the variances in SOC 
 seudomonas Rudaea Bacillus Clostridium Burkholderia and Dyella belong to cellulolytic bacteria32 and together explained 66.3 % of the variances in SOC suggesting that SOC is mainly regulated by these six cellulolytic bacteria 
 emmatimonas 22.6 % 245 OTUs is the most abundant bacterial genera in this study Fig . 2 , and explained 12.4 % of the variances in SOC Fig . 4

 and K fertilizers were only applied as basal fertilizers and N fertilizers were used with 50 % 20 % 12 % and 18 % at the seedling tillering jointing and earring stages of rice-growing seasons and with 50 % 30 % and 20 % at the seedling tillering and boosting stages of wheat-growing seasons respectively 
 oils were sieved through a 5 mm screen for uniformity and stored at −​20 °C and all determinations were finished within two weeks 
 he concentration and quality A260/A280 of the soil DNA were measured by a NanoDrop ND-2000 spectrophotometer NanoDrop Wilmington DE USA 
 he DNA of each sample was diluted 50-fold and stored at −​20 °C and all determinations were completed within two weeks 
 ach sample was amplified in triplicate in a 25 μ​l reaction and the program was as follows initial denaturation at 95 °C for 4 min followed by 25 cycles of denaturation 94 °C for 30 s , annealing 55 °C for 45 s , extension 72 °C for 1 min , and a final elongation step for 8 min at 72 °C 
 herefore bacteria may have greater contributions to SOC concentration than fungi in the rice-wheat system

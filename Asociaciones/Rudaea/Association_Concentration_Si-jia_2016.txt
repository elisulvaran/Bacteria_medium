 high level of DO can result in an increase of dissolved organic matter concentration through erosion of bound extracellular polymeric substances EPS which consequently deteriorate effluent quality and increase operating costs Ma et al. , 2013 
 ell membrane fluidity is essential for many biological membrane functions such as the passive permeability of molecules and active solute transport Lippincott-Schwartz et al. 2001 Van Meer et al. 2008

 rom Fig . 2b it can be seen that at Reactors A and B the content of C15 had a significant decrease while the content of C16 and C18 all increased distinctly on the 30th day 
 hifts of microbial community structure The microbial community structure differences in responding to different DO levels on the 15th day and 30th day were detected by MiSeq high-throughput sequencing Fig . 3 
 ig . 3a showed that the microbial community at phylum level Reactors A B and C dominantly consisted of Proteobacteria 64.84 % 29.2 % and 74.88 % Bacteroidetes 8.24 % 22.54 % and 8.16 % Actinobacteria 17.81 % 30.15 % and 11.82 % on the 15th day and Proteobacteria 19.2 % 21.79 % and 20.75 % Bacteroidetes 36.2 % , 12.92 % and 15.33 % , Actinobacteria 4.21 % , 18.7 % and 19.6 % and TM7 29.2 % , 35.5 % and 32.4 % on the 30th day respectively 
 s shown in Fig . 3a Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum on the 15th day at Reactors A 0.71â€“1.32 mg/L and C 4.31â€“ 5.16 mg/L which agreed with previous studies in full-scale wastewater treatment plants Peng et al. 2014 Zhang et al. , 2012 
 M7 increased significantly to be the most abundant phylum at Reactor B and C on the 30th day while Bacteroidetes was the most abundant phylum at DO of 0.71â€“1.32 mg/L 
 ig . 3b shows that Zoogloea Leptothrix Nakamurella and Micropruina genera were consistently abundant in the sludge of three reactors on the 15th day 
 t day 30 the most abundant genus in Reactors A B and C was TM7 genera incertae sedis which has a significant increase in utilization of carbohydrates Wakelin et al. 2012 
 he Zoogloea genera 0.1 % in Reactor A 0.9 % in Reactor B and 1.9 % in Reactor C were widely spread in activated sludge and had been regarded as the key populations responsible for the flocculation of activated sludge Zhang et al. 2012 . 3.6

 2.4 mmol/L stock solution of dimethyl sulphoxide was added to the cell suspension to give a final concentration of 1 lmol/L 
 urn off the argon laser after irreversibly bleaching the bound reagent for five minutes 
 he average COD removal efficiency decreased with the decline of DO concentration Reactor C 4.31â€“ 5.16 mg/L 94.1 % > Reactor B 2.13â€“3.02 mg/L 92.3 % > Reactor A 0.71â€“1.32 mg/L 89.9 % 
 t suggested that at the first hour the COD removal rate increased as follows Reactor C 4.31â€“5.16 mg/L 32.3 % < Reactor B 2.13â€“ 3.02 mg/L 41.2 % < Reactor A 0.71â€“1.32 mg/L 56.7 % 
 t is consistent with the findings that at the first hour in one cycle the COD removal efficiencies were higher at aeration intensity of 0.2â€“ 0.4 MPa than 0.6 MPa Xin et al. 2016 
 his sequence changed with the fast increasing of COD removal efficiencies of Reactor C which got the largest COD removal efficiency at the second hour 
 s shown in Table 3 Reactor C operating at DO of 4.31â€“5.16 mg/L had the fastest rate of fluorescence recovery while Reactor B operating at DO of 2.13â€“3.02 mg/L had the lowest with substantial mobile fraction Mf as follows Reactor B 40.4 % < Reactor A 46.1 % < Reactor C 49.3 % 
 n this study the contents of unsaturated fatty acids decreased during the whole operation except for a slight increase trend at Reactor A 0.71â€“1.32 mg/L on the 30th day from 7.44 Â± 0.77 % to 10.29 Â± 0.66 % 
 reached-chain fatty acids content on the 15th day were Reactor B 34.06 Â± 0.93 % < Reactor C 49.23 Â± 5.91 % < Reactor A 58.82 Â± 7.93 % 
 he branched fatty acids content had a decrease in all reactors in comparison to the 15th day 
 specially the C15:0 anteiso content had a significant increase as follows Reactor B 24.36 Â± 0.16 % < Reactor C 33.31 Â± 4.11 % < Reactor A 41.97 Â± 3.9 % 
 t the 30th day the C15:0 anteiso content had a decrease to Reactor B 19.40 Â± 2.34 % < Reactor A 25.56 Â± 0.28 % < Reactor C 25.90 Â± 2.13 % 
 n the genus level the content exceeded 0.1 % which was selected to generate the heat map Fig . 3b 
 he microbial community at genus level changed greatly in the three reactors from the 15th day to 30th day 
 t Reactor B on the 15th day the dominant phyla were Actinobacteria 30.15 % , Proteobacteria 29.2 % , Bacteroidetes 22.54 % 
 fter the reactors run for 30 days the microbial community had changed greatly compared to the 15th day Fig . 3a 
 he results of this study confirmed this phenomenon by finding that the lowest protein content in the effluent of Reactor B with larger amount of Bacteroidetes on the 15th day while at the 30th day the Bacteroidetes content in Reactor B changed to the lowest with the lowest protein content which means other bacteria may account for the protein removal 
 aracoccus a denitrifying group was more abundant at three reactors on the 30th day

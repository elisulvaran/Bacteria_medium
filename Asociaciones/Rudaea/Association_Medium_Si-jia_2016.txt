high level of DO can result in an increase of dissolved organic matter concentration through erosion of bound extracellular polymeric substances EPS which consequently deteriorate effluent quality and increase operating costs Ma et al. , 2013 
n the meantime a low DO adversely affects treatment efficiencies and causes sludge bulking especially in industrial sewage Zheng 646 S.-j 
owever few researches have addressed the influence of the DO levels on the cell membrane characteristics of AS rather than merely the expected effects on intracellular and extracellular polymers in activated sludge process 
resently changes in cell membrane characteristics of single bacteria have been reported based on their response to heavy metals low temperature and organic solvents Fang et al. 2004 Fang et al. 2007 Niu et al. 2012 Ramos et al. 2002 , but few investigators have reported the effects of DO levels on microbial cell membrane properties in activated sludge 
ell membrane fluidity is essential for many biological membrane functions such as the passive permeability of molecules and active solute transport Lippincott-Schwartz et al. 2001 Van Meer et al. 2008 
he fluidity of cell membrane strongly influences the transportation and extrusion of many structurally and functionally unrelated compounds which may have a significant effect on wastewater treatment efficiency and soluble microbial products SMP ( Ramos et al. 2002 
embranes appear to have specific lipid constituents to maintain fluidity and the ability to transport nutrients under various stress conditions Niu et al. 2013 Zhao et al. 2014 
herefore when environment changes the microbes regulate the composition of the membrane lipids to maintain the fluidity and membrane phase behavior to minimize energy expenditure and optimize growth 
nderstanding the bacterial cell membrane properties in activated sludge processes and analyzing the shifts in responding to different DO levels are essential to develop efficient treatment strategies 
ourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR measurements and FRAP analysis had been used to analyze cell membrane fluidity Fang et al. 2007 Mullineaux et al. 2006 ; and Agilent 7890 Gas Chromatography with flame ionization detector FID was widely used to detected cell membrane phospholipid compositions Niu et al. 2012 
t has been reported that unsaturated fatty acids and branched fatty acids can disrupt the close packing of phospholipid acyl chains and lower the temperature of the phase transition Kaneda 1991 Niu et al. 2012 
hang et al . 2011 reported that an increase of aeration off time could decrease monounsaturated fatty acids content and increase branched fatty acids content in submerged membrane bioreactor 
ang et al . 2007 reported that 0.01 mol/L of nC60 fullerene water suspensions decreased the amount of unsaturated fatty acids and increased the content of branched fatty acids of Bacillus subtilis which led to an increase of cell membrane fluidity where oxygen was absent 
hifts of microbial cell membrane properties PLFA and fluidity in response to different DO levels and the changes with time under same DO levels in activated sludge are still unclear 
nalysis of this constituent would be helpful to enhance treatment efficiency and decrease SMP content in activated sludge 
nvironmental conditions such as pH temperature and DO have significant influence on microbial ecology Yang et al. 2011 
he PLFA composition and SMP were determined by microbiota in activated sludge 
owever most related investigations are contradictory and the relationship between DO levels and microbial com- munity is still unclear in activated sludge 
t also has been reported that DO levels significantly affect the microbial community structure including Actinobacteria Proteobacteria Nitrospira Bacteroidetes and so on Xin et al. 2016 Yadav et al. 2014 Zhang et al. 2012 .Therefore the structural changes of microbial communities in responding to different DO levels should be meaningfully characterized 
he MiSeq platform Illumina Inc. USA provides a way to achieve high-through-put sequencing which enables microbial ecology the greatest coverage and most accurate DNA data for analysis of the microbial community in various environmental samples Yadav et al. 2014 Zhu et al. 2015 
he objectives of this study were to ( 1 compare the effluent dissolved organics matters of the three SBRs with different DO levels fed with a synthetic wastewater ( 2 investigate surface morphology and mechanics characteristics of sludge cell membrane physiological properties including membrane phospholipids composition and membrane fluidity and ( 3 investigate the microbial community structures and the effects of microbial community structures changes on membrane physiological properties 
hose findings would be helpful to the development of strategies to minimize energy consumption and optimize performance in WWTPs . 2

he suspension was incubated for approximately 30 min in the presence of BODIPY then harvested by centrifugation at room temperature and washed several times in synthetic wastewater to remove unincorporated dye 
mages were recorded with a laser scanning confocal microscope LSCM FV1000 Olympus Co. Japan equipped with a 10 mW argon laser and BODIPY fluorescence emissions were selected using green 515‚Äì565 nm filters 
leaching was recorded at 488 nm and fluorescence emission was detected between 520 and 545 nm 
re- and post-bleach scans were recorded separately at 2 min intervals over a 512  512 pixel area using the xy mode for scanning 
he mobile fraction Mf from FRAP experiments was determined by Mf = Ft F0 / Fi F0 where Ft is the fluorescence in the bleached region after full recovery Fi is the fluorescence before bleaching and F0 is the fluorescence just after bleaching LippincottSchwartz et al. 2001 . 2.5 
aponification was carried out with a sodium hydroxide-methanol-distilled water mixture m/v/v 45:150:150 and methylation with a mixture of hydrochloric acid‚Äìmethanol v/v 325:275

esults and discussion 3.1 
1a in the beginning of the experimental runs a period of time was set to allow the three SBRs A B and C to adapt to the different DO levels 
ll the reactors achieved steady operation status after running 15 days and the COD removal efficiencies were higher than 85 % under all operation conditions 
t a single cycle of the operation of each reactor COD removal efficiency was detected and noted when all the reactors achieved steady operation status Fig 
EM spectrum showed that aromatic protein-like peak at Ex/Em = 280‚Äì285/305‚Äì310 and peak at Ex/ Em = 228‚Äì235/330‚Äì340 , humic acid-like peak at Ex/Em = 340‚Äì 345/380‚Äì390 and fulvic acid-like Ex/Em = 240‚Äì250/460‚Äì475 substances presented in the effluent according to the method from Chen et al . 2003 and Zhu et al . 2012 
romatic protein-like and fulvic acid-like were two major substances in the effluent dissolved organic matter on the 15th day 
t day 30 the fluorescence intensity of fulvic acid-like and aromatic protein-like decreased while the humic acid-like substance enriched 
oughness and adhesion force of sludge Atomic force microscopy AFM provided important morphology features and mechanical characteristics and was thus used to detect microscale images and surface properties of the sludge samples on the 30th day Fig 
he adhesion forces of sludge for Reactors A B and C were 29.1 ¬± 2.2 nN 12.1 ¬± 0.27 nN and 7.4 ¬± 0.35 nN Table 2 , respectively 
he Ra roughness for Reactors A B and C were 246.5 ¬± 37.1 nm 81.7 ¬± 3.4 nm and 86.6 ¬± 1.2 nm Table 2 , respectively 
n wastewater treatment organics removal consists of two steps adsorption and degradation 
t has been reported that an increase of adhesion force could facilitate the bacterial interactions or the adhesion between carbohydrate and specific receptors such as concanavalin A receptor surfaces in biological processes Pussak et al. 2014 
ut Li et al . 2014 reported that no significant correlation was found between adhesion energy and microbial aggregation or transport behavior 
s shown in Fig . 1b at the first hour in one operating cycle the removal of COD were 226.8 mg/L 164.8 mg/L and 129.2 mg/L at Reactors A 0.71‚Äì1.32 mg/L , B 2.13‚Äì3.02 mg/L , and C 4.31‚Äì5.16 mg/L , respectively 
his results indicate that a decrease of DO level may facilitate the adhesion between glucose and cell surface in activated sludge thus promote the COD removal at the first hour 
hysicochemical properties present on the outer cell membrane are known to affect the organics adhesion and transportation behavior Li et al. 2014 
iu et al . 2013 reported that at low temperature under heteropolar magnetic field treatment the cells of activated sludge appeared a lower roughness which may be conducive to the interaction between cells and absorption of nutrient to a certain extent improving mass transfer effect

nder laser scanning confocal microscopy LSCM , microorganisms displayed green colors after binding with BODIPY FL-C12 and the red circle was used to limit the bleached area 
iu et al . 2012 reported that low temperature could led to an increase of unsaturated fatty acids and thus promote the cell membrane fluidity of activated sludge which can enhance the mass transfer efficiency of cells 
t has been reported that microorganisms can catalyze the active extrusion of many structurally and functionally unrelated compounds from bacterial cytoplasm to external media for optimal growth 
he changes of cell membrane fluidity under DO levels of 0.71‚Äì 1.32 mg/L 2.13‚Äì3.02 mg/L and 4.31‚Äì5.16 mg/L were consistent with the different effluent protein content

hen the three reactors maintained for 30 days > 3 SRT the branched fatty acids content at the three reactors A B and C all had a decrease respectively 34.89 ¬± 0.33 % , 27.94 ¬± 4 % and 38.43 ¬± 3.44 % 
he unsaturated fatty acids content at Reactors B and C continuously decreased 13.19 ¬± 2.23 % and 10.4 ¬± 1.92 % but at Reactor A had a slight increase 10.29 ¬± 0.66 % 
so- and anteisobranched fatty acids have the same ability as unsaturated fatty acids to disrupt the close packing of phospholipid acyl chains and lower the temperature of the phase transition Kaneda 1991 Niu et al. 2012 
ifferent substrate or environments could cause different phospholipid compositions and the increase of breached-chain fatty acids may be a defense mechanism employed by microorganisms responding to stress conditions fullerene and toluene ( Fang et al. 2007 Fang et al. 2004 
n the initial stage microbes growing at DO of 0.71‚Äì1.32 mg/L and 4.31‚Äì5.16 mg/L increased the synthesis of branched fatty acids for maintaining mass transfer and growth 
hen all the reactors achieved steady operation the microbes recompounded their lipid compositions and the contents of breached-chain fatty acids on the 30th day were as follows Reactor B 27.94 ¬± 4 % < Reactor A 34.89 ¬± 0.33 % < Reactor C 38.43 ¬± 3.44 % 
nd the higher branched fatty acids content accounted for the faster cell membrane fluidity at Reactors A and C in comparison to at Reactor B

he results suggested that at DO of 4.31‚Äì5.16 mg/L and 0.71‚Äì1.32 mg/L microbes can increase the synthesis of branched fatty acids to increase the fluidity of cell membranes for optimal growth 
rom Fig . 2b it can be seen that at Reactors A and B the content of C15 had a significant decrease while the content of C16 and C18 all increased distinctly on the 30th day 
t Reactor C the content of C15 and C16 all had a slight decrease but the content of C18 increased 
ll this reflected the domestication and selection of DO for plasma membrane phospholipid fatty acids . 3.5 
hifts of microbial community structure The microbial community structure differences in responding to different DO levels on the 15th day and 30th day were detected by MiSeq high-throughput sequencing Fig . 3

he other phylum were Acidobacteria Nitrospira Chloroflexi Firmicutes Gemmatimonadetes Verrucomicrobia OD1 Thermotogae and Spirochaetes 
s shown in Fig . 3a Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum on the 15th day at Reactors A 0.71‚Äì1.32 mg/L and C 4.31‚Äì 5.16 mg/L which agreed with previous studies in full-scale wastewater treatment plants Peng et al. 2014 Zhang et al. , 2012 
t has been reported that Actinobacteria is the most abundant phylum in activated sludge treating pharmaceutical and dye wastewater Yadav et al. 2014 
M7 increased significantly to be the most abundant phylum at Reactor B and C on the 30th day while Bacteroidetes was the most abundant phylum at DO of 0.71‚Äì1.32 mg/L 
he main microbial community differences among the three SBRs were the content of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria

acteroidetes plays an important role in using protein and chitin and is proficient in degrading part of the high molecular mass fraction of the DOM Ma et al. 2013 
eng et al . 2014 reported that changes in microbial communities are one of leading reasons for variations in metabolites and such changes may have a direct effect on effluent quality 
ig . 3b shows that Zoogloea Leptothrix Nakamurella and Micropruina genera were consistently abundant in the sludge of three reactors on the 15th day 
ith the reactors operation those genera decreased and the microbial communities changed greatly 
t day 30 the most abundant genus in Reactors A B and C was TM7 genera incertae sedis which has a significant increase in utilization of carbohydrates Wakelin et al. 2012 
rom the heat map of the genus relative abundances Nakamurella and Micropruina increased with the increase of the DO level 
t has been reported that Nakamurella and Micropruina are able to accumulate large amounts of polysaccharides in their cells Hope et al. 2010 Begum and Batista 2012 
aracoccus and Rudaea decreased with the increase of DO levels 
he Zoogloea genera 0.1 % in Reactor A 0.9 % in Reactor B and 1.9 % in Reactor C were widely spread in activated sludge and had been regarded as the key populations responsible for the flocculation of activated sludge Zhang et al. 2012 . 3.6

revious studies have proven that these PLFA and genera may significantly influence the effluent quality Niu et al. 2012 Yadav et al. 2014 
ome genera showed high positive correlation with AFA and IFA including Ideonella Nakamurella and Zoogloea 
bove results showed that the changes of DO levels promoted the shifts of microbial community and the compositions of PLFA which influenced the effluent dissolved organic matter . 652 S.-j 
onclusion The results showed that DO of 2.13‚Äì3.02 mg/L led to the lowest effluent dissolved organics matters content and an increase of DO level resulted in decreasing surface adhesion force 
O of 0.71‚Äì 1.32 mg/L and 4.31‚Äì5.16 mg/L could prompt cell membrane fluidity by increasing the synthesis of branched fatty acids 
t was also found that higher abundance of bacteria which contain more branched fatty acids resulted in the increase of fluidity and branched fatty acids content which further influenced the effluent quality 
FA AFA and IFA significantly influenced the effluent dissolved organic matter

verall performance of the three sequencing batch reactors SBRs As shown in Fig 
hen operated at DO of 2.13‚Äì 3.02 mg/L COD of effluent was the lowest at this period 
he average COD removal efficiency decreased with the decline of DO concentration Reactor C 4.31‚Äì 5.16 mg/L 94.1 % > Reactor B 2.13‚Äì3.02 mg/L 92.3 % > Reactor A 0.71‚Äì1.32 mg/L 89.9 % 
t is agreed with the findings that an increase of DO levels could led to an increase of COD removal efficiency Yadav et al. 2014 
t suggested that at the first hour the COD removal rate increased as follows Reactor C 4.31‚Äì5.16 mg/L 32.3 % < Reactor B 2.13‚Äì 3.02 mg/L 41.2 % < Reactor A 0.71‚Äì1.32 mg/L 56.7 % 
t is consistent with the findings that at the first hour in one cycle the COD removal efficiencies were higher at aeration intensity of 0.2‚Äì 0.4 MPa than 0.6 MPa Xin et al. 2016 
his sequence changed with the fast increasing of COD removal efficiencies of Reactor C which got the largest COD removal efficiency at the second hour 
iao et al . 2011 reported that an increase in the DO level resulted in a higher COD removal rate of activated sludge under thermophilic conditions 
nalysis of the treated effluent showed that the content of proteins increased as follows Reactor B 3.6 ¬± 0.5 mg/L < Reactor A 7.3 ¬± 0.6 mg/L < Reactor C 10.8 ¬± 1.5 mg/L 
he highest protein content in effluent was at Reactor C which is similar with the findings that higher shear condition DO was about 6 mg/L resulted in the increase of SMP concentrations in membrane bioreactors Menniti et al. 2010 
he results suggested that a moderate DO level 2.13‚Äì3.02 mg/L can result in the lowest protein content in effluent of SBRs . 3.2 
his indicates that the increase of DO level leads to a decrease of adhesion force 
ansel et al . 2006 reported that with the increase of membrane roughness during filtration the amount of EPS deposited on the membranes increased significantly 
n this study it means that substance transportation through the outer cell membrane was easier at DO of 2.13‚Äì3.02 mg/L 
he effects of DO levels on the fluidity of cell membranes were studied by measuring the diffusion coefficients for BODIPY FL-C12labeled plasma membrane lipids Mullineaux et al. 2006 
he diffusion coefficient of lipids in the membrane can be calculated from the extent of recovery of fluorescence in the bleached patch Fig 
he rate of fluorescence recovery is proportional to the rate of labeled molecules move into the bleached area 
he percentage of fluorescence intensity of recovery rates could be used to represent the fluidity of cell membranes 
s shown in Table 3 Reactor C operating at DO of 4.31‚Äì5.16 mg/L had the fastest rate of fluorescence recovery while Reactor B operating at DO of 2.13‚Äì3.02 mg/L had the lowest with substantial mobile fraction Mf as follows Reactor B 40.4 % < Reactor A 46.1 % < Reactor C 49.3 % 
t has been reported that the change of cell membrane fluidity may be a mechanism to adapt to environmental changes Fang et al. 2007 
he change in cell membrane fluidity is the key to implementing this self-defense function Ramos et al. 2002 
his discovery might be useful for reducing the content of EfOM or DON in the effluent . 3.4 
t has been reported that the increase of unsaturated fatty acids can enhance the mass transfer efficiency of cells which is necessary for efficient metabolism at low temperature Niu et al. 2012 Niu et al. 2013 
owever Fang et al. 2007 reported that depending on the different environments present microbial response may result in decreased or increased unsaturated fatty acids 
n this study the contents of unsaturated fatty acids decreased during the whole operation except for a slight increase trend at Reactor A 0.71‚Äì1.32 mg/L on the 30th day from 7.44 ¬± 0.77 % to 10.29 ¬± 0.66 % 
n this study branched fatty acids were more abundant than unsaturated fatty acids in the whole operation Fig . 2a 
reached-chain fatty acids content on the 15th day were Reactor B 34.06 ¬± 0.93 % < Reactor C 49.23 ¬± 5.91 % < Reactor A 58.82 ¬± 7.93 % 
he branched fatty acids content had a decrease in all reactors in comparison to the 15th day 
t has been reported that the decrease of branched fatty acids may be a defense mechanism to prevent the membrane from being too fluid for optimal growth Fang et al. 2007 
specially the C15:0 anteiso content had a significant increase as follows Reactor B 24.36 ¬± 0.16 % < Reactor C 33.31 ¬± 4.11 % < Reactor A 41.97 ¬± 3.9 % 
t the 30th day the C15:0 anteiso content had a decrease to Reactor B 19.40 ¬± 2.34 % < Reactor A 25.56 ¬± 0.28 % < Reactor C 25.90 ¬± 2.13 % 
n the whole period C15:0 anteiso was the most abundant branched fatty acids 
t has been reported that C15:0 anteiso has the lowest phase transition temperature 23 ¬∞C in comparison to others Kaneda 1991 
he results suggested that in the three reactors the synthesis of long chain fatty acids the number of carbons > 18 increased when the reactors achieved steady operation stage 
n the genus level the content exceeded 0.1 % which was selected to generate the heat map Fig . 3b 
he microbial community at genus level changed greatly in the three reactors from the 15th day to 30th day 
t Reactor B on the 15th day the dominant phyla were Actinobacteria 30.15 % , Proteobacteria 29.2 % , Bacteroidetes 22.54 % 
xygen stress 1‚Äì5 mg/L appeared to distinctly affect the bacterial community structure in MBR Ma et al. 2013

ecently Peng et al . 2014 showed that TM7 increases notably in the middle of the rotating biological contactor RBC 
he color bar indicates the range of the percentage of a genus in a sample based on the color key log 10 scale at the bottom right corner 
he results of this study confirmed this phenomenon by finding that the lowest protein content in the effluent of Reactor B with larger amount of Bacteroidetes on the 15th day while at the 30th day the Bacteroidetes content in Reactor B changed to the lowest with the lowest protein content which means other bacteria may account for the protein removal 
aracoccus a denitrifying group was more abundant at three reactors on the 30th day

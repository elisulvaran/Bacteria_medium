ased on its unique phenotypic genotypic and phylogenetic features strain KIS3-4T represents a novel genus and species for which the name Rudaea cellulosilytica gen. nov. sp . nov. is proposed 
he type strain of Rudaea cellulosilytica is KIS3-4T 5KACC 12734T 5JCM 15422T . The family Xanthomonadaceae consists of Gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria

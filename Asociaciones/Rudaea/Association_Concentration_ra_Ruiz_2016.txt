oreover the reduction of diversity from the endorhizosphere towards the red leaves may support the fact that part of colonization of the plant by bacteria could have an origin in the rhizospheric soils through the roots and subsequent migration to the aerial parts of the plant

Analysis of the total bacterial endophytic community structures The majority of sequences in the endosphere represented 249 OPUs affiliated with Proteobacteria 86.7 % of the total sequences integrated in 151 OPUs

 sychrobacter sp . OPU 6 up to 37.5 % was especially abundant in red and R. cellulosilytica OPU 1 up to 12.1 % was remarkably abundant in green and root Fig . 3 
 n general the abundances of the exclusive OPUs were low and ranged between 0.01 % and 1.70 % with the exception of Enterobacter amnigenus OPU 57 that accounted for 8.67 % of the total sequences in Alcúdia roots Fig . 3 
 hizospheric soils from Alcúdia and Campos shared 17 4.8 ± 2.5 % of the total sequences and 39 20.2 ± 3.3 % of the total sequences OPUs with the respective endospheres

OPU 190 and ABS-19 OPU 251 ( these latter five clades together represented between 10 % and 19 % of the total sequences 
 n addition R. cellulosilytica also co-occurred but with abundances lower than 1.4 % whereas C. canadensis occurred in all fractions from plants and soil which was similar to Halomonas sp . for the Alcúdia location . DISCUSSION To our knowledge this is the first report where compartmentalization of endophytic bacterial communities from the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of halophytes has been analyzed at a microscale and mesoscale 
 PUs could be identified as taxa at the species and genus levels because the sequences were of higher quality lengths of over 800 bp compared to other similar studies Gottel et al . 2011 Bodenhausen Horton and Bergelson 2013 , and also because the OPU approach by means of phylogenetic inferences produced more accurate identifications 92.8 % of the OPUs could be affiliated at the genus level Vidal et al . 2015 
 n this regard the soils studied here exhibited considerable physicochemical differences that could condition their bacterial diversity Fierer and Jackson 2006 despite the fact that pH was alkaline and similar to other reported values Pereira , Vicentini and Ottoboni 2014 Gao et al . 2015 
 heir presence in the endosphere could originate after root colonization due to chemotaxis Bulgarelli et al . 2013 from the soil communities Wulff van Vuurde and Hockenhull 2003 Chi et al . 2005 , followed by migration to the aerial parts 
 owever the fact that between 9 % for Alcúdia and 53 % for Campos of the total endospheric taxonomic composition was shared with their corresponding rhizospheric soil communities led us to believe that root colonization may be the major contributor to the endosphere composition Bulgarelli et al . 2013 
 clear diversity gradient was observed between the three compartments in each plant being higher in the rhizosphere as already reported for Arabidopsis thaliana Bodenhausen Mora-Ruiz et al . Horton and Bergelson 2013 and decreasing towards the more mature aerial parts with the latter having less equitability 
 dditionally two of the most important OPUs Psychrobacter sp . and Rudaea cellulosilytica had notable abundance variations in the red fractions being higher and lower respectively in these more mature parts of the plant in comparison with other areas of the endosphere 
 he reduction of diversity from the roots towards the more mature parts of the plant apart from reinforcing a rhizospheric origin of the endogenous microbiota may respond to factors such as passive mobility following water fluxes Taghavi et al . 2010 ; specific selection due to plant–microbe interaction such as chemotaxis Bulgarelli et al . 2013 or plant defensive systems Jones and Dangl 2006 ; and specialization in niche colonization Bulgarelli et al . 2013 
 he influence of the soil on plant microbial colonization was supported by its sharing of taxa with the plant compartments and with reduction of diversity from the roots towards the mature aerial parts

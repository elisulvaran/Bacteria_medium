oreover, the reduction of diversity from the endorhizosphere towards the red leaves may support the fact that part of colonization of the plant by bacteria could have an origin in the rhizospheric soils through the roots and subsequent migration to the aerial parts of the plant 
 oth locations are in Mallorca and are separated by a distance of approximately 60 km 
 lant material surfaces were washed with the following sequential steps: initial incubation for 5 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 with sterile distilled water, followed by 5 min in sterile distilled water alone, 5 min in 2% bleach (NaClO) and finally 5 min in sterile distilled water 
 o disaggregate the plant tissues, 5–25 mL of PBS 1X were added to the plant material and the mixture was macerated using a sterile mortar and pestle (MoraRuiz et al. 2015).  Separation of the microbial fraction from vegetal debris, and microbial DNA extraction Fifteen milliliters of macerated biomass were subjected to differential centrifugation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation, as previously reported (Mora-Ruiz et al. 2015) 
  second PCR was performed using 5 µL of the product as template, in triplicates of 25 µL, using the primers GM3-PS and a variant of 907-PS (from position 8 to 907: V1–V4 regions of 16S rRNA; Table S1, Supporting Information) to tag and link the amplicon, with the same annealing temperature 
 he NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Massachusetts, USA) and MassRuler Express Forward DNA Ladder Mix (Thermo Scientific) were used to measure the concentration of the barcoded amplicons 
  total of 97 872 sequences were generated that, after trimming and removing short, bad or chimera sequences, resulted in a dataset of 58 517 sequences with a mean of 2438 ± 1825 per sample (Table S1, Supporting Information) 
 he analyzed physicochemical parameters were pH, electrical conductivity (at 25◦ C), oxidizable organic matter  Soil physicochemical parameters indicated that the pH was alkaline and nearly the same in both locations (8.28 ± 0.39 and 8.29 ± 0.18; P > 0.05)

 n this regard, the soils studied here exhibited considerable physicochemical differences that could condition their bacterial diversity (Fierer and Jackson 2006), despite the fact that pH was alkaline and similar to other reported values (Pereira, Vicentini and Ottoboni 2014; Gao et al. 2015) 
 heir presence in the endosphere could originate after root colonization due to chemotaxis (Bulgarelli et al. 2013) from the soil communities (Wulff, van Vuurde and Hockenhull 2003; Chi et al. 2005), followed by migration to the aerial parts 
 dditionally, two of the most important OPUs, Psychrobacter sp. and Rudaea cellulosilytica, had notable abundance variations in the red fractions, being higher and lower (respectively) in these more mature parts of the plant in comparison with other areas of the endosphere 
 he reduction of diversity from the roots towards the more mature parts of the plant, apart from reinforcing a rhizospheric origin of the endogenous microbiota, may respond to factors such as passive mobility following water fluxes (Taghavi et al. 2010); specific selection due to plant–microbe interaction, such as chemotaxis (Bulgarelli et al. 2013) or plant defensive systems (Jones and Dangl 2006); and specialization in niche colonization (Bulgarelli et al. 2013) 
 he influence of the soil on plant microbial colonization was supported by its sharing of taxa with the plant compartments, and with reduction of diversity from the roots towards the mature aerial parts

 ven though the optimum salinity in the substrate ranges from 171 to 540 mM NaCl, this species can grow on substrates with salinities up to 1030 mM NaCl (RedondoGómez et al. 2010) 
 he root samples were rinsed six times with sterile water (5 min each step) in order to completely remove the soil attached to their surfaces 
 umbers inside the bar charts are the average percentages of sequences detected in each OPU per sample; abundances under 0.5% are not represented 
 owever, relevant host genotype differences were discarded as the plants were only 60 km apart 
 n alternative origin could also be related to aerosol transmission through the aerial parts (Fahlgren et al. 2010), or by vertical transmission (bacteria already occurring in the seeds; Truyens et al. 2015)

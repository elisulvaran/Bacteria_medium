 uring the operation process, the concentrations of phenol in influent and effluent were monitored daily, and the concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS), the sludge volume after 0.5 h of settling (SV30) and the pH of effluent were measured at certain days. 2.3 
 nalytical methods To determine the concentrations of phenol, the effluent samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min to remove suspended sludge, and the supernatants were analyze using a JASCO V-560 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Japan) 
 LSS and SV30 were measured using the standard methods, and the pH of effluents was determined by a Mettler-Toledo S30 pH meter (Switzerland). 2.4 
 henol removal performance of SBRs systems The 15 SBRs were operated for more than two months, and the MLSS, SV30 and effluent pH had no significant changes (Fig 
 uring the first 10 days of operation, the phenol removal efficiencies had no significant changes and remained around 99% 
 nder phenol shock loading conditions, the abundances of Zoogloea in SWCNTs-treated groups decreased firstly and then increased when phenol concentration was raised, while the abundances of Haliscomenobacter increased in each treatment 
 ethylocystis, Thauera and Sphingomonas all increased in relative abundances as the phenol concentration increased, especially in SWCNTs-treated groups when phenol concentration was raised to 500 mg/L (Fig. 4) 
 o discern the impact of SWCNTs on microbial community composition, Pearson correlation between the abundance of different taxa and the concentration of SWCNTs was examined 
 o simulate phenol shock loading, the SBRs were operated for 40 days with the concentrations of phenol in influent increasing from 200 mg/L (0–20 days) to 500 mg/L (20–40 days) 
 hen phenol concentration was around 200 mg/L, each of the SBRs exhibited excellent phenol removal efficiencies (>98%), which was in accordance with the previous study (Qu et al., 2015) 
 hen phenol concentration increased to 500 mg/L, the SBRs treated with different concentrations of SWCNTs maintained high efficiencies of phenol removal (>98%), while the phenol removal efficiency of G1 declined from 98.8% to 84.0% over the long-term operation 
 owever, after 20 days of exposure, the phenol removal efficiencies significantly decreased (<85%) 
 hile under CNTs shock loading conditions, the abundances of Proteobacteria had almost no changes after 1 day of operation (P > 0.10) but significantly decreased after 20 days (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3a) 
 he abundance of Rudaea decreased when the concentration of phenol was 500 mg/L, but it would be improved after the long-term operation under CNTs shock loading conditions 
 he relative abundance of Burkholderia decreased during the long-term operation, while the relative abundance of Acinetobacter had a slight increase under low concentration of phenol (200 mg/L), but then decreased after long-term exposure to either high phenol concentration or CNTs shock loading (Fig. 4)

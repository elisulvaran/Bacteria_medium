 llumina MiSeq sequencing revealed that the diversity richness and structure of microbial communities were shifted under phenol shock loading especially under high phenol concentration but not under CNTs shock loading 
 urthermore the toxicity of CNTs on microbial communities is suggested to be related with the concentration physical properties length and diameter and types of functionalization carboxylic and hydroxylic ( Goyal et al. 2010 Luongo and Zhang 2010 Oleszczuk et al. 2011 Parise et al. 2014 Kerfahi et al. 2015 
 hemicals and activated sludge SWCNTs > 95 % were purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port Co. Ltd. Shenzhen China and the characteristics of the SWCNTs have been described previously Shen et al. 2013 Qu et al. , 2015 
 he SBRs were operated with the synthetic wastewater containing 500 mg/L phenol for another 20 days and samples were taken at Day 0 1 and 20 designated as Day C0 C1 and C20 for sequencing analysis 
 uring the operation process the concentrations of phenol in influent and effluent were monitored daily and the concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solid MLSS , the sludge volume after 0.5 h of settling SV30 and the pH of effluent were measured at certain days . 2.3 
 nalytical methods To determine the concentrations of phenol the effluent samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min to remove suspended sludge and the supernatants were analyze using a JASCO V-560 UV–vis spectrophotometer Japan 
 LSS and SV30 were measured using the standard methods and the pH of effluents was determined by a Mettler-Toledo S30 pH meter Switzerland . 2.4 
 henol removal performance of SBRs systems The 15 SBRs were operated for more than two months and the MLSS SV30 and effluent pH had no significant changes Fig 
 uring the first 10 days of operation the phenol removal efficiencies had no significant changes and remained around 99 % 
 hen facing CNTs shock loading the microbial richness and diversity had no significant changes upon either short-term 1 day or long-term 20 days exposure P > 0.10 ( Table 1 
 t the phylum level a total of 30 phyla were detected and the majority belonged to 10 phyla which covered over 97 % of the effective sequence tags 
 ther dominant phyla included Bacteroidetes 5.3–15.7 % , Acidobacteria 3.1–9.7 % and Planctomycetes 1.9–6.7 % 
 ithin Proteobacteria Gammaproteobacteria 11.0–36.8 % , Alphaproteobacteria 13.2–36.1 % and Bataproteobacteria 9.8–27.7 % were more abundant in all samples Fig . 3b 
 nder phenol shock loading conditions the abundances of Zoogloea in SWCNTs-treated groups decreased firstly and then increased when phenol concentration was raised while the abundances of Haliscomenobacter increased in each treatment 
 ethylocystis Thauera and Sphingomonas all increased in relative abundances as the phenol concentration increased especially in SWCNTs-treated groups when phenol concentration was raised to 500 mg/L Fig . 4 
 o discern the impact of SWCNTs on microbial community composition Pearson correlation between the abundance of different taxa and the concentration of SWCNTs was examined 
 o simulate phenol shock loading the SBRs were operated for 40 days with the concentrations of phenol in influent increasing from 200 mg/L 0–20 days to 500 mg/L 20–40 days 
 or phenol shock loading the concentrations of phenol in influent was increased from 200 mg/L 0–20 days to 500 mg/L 20–40 days 
 hen phenol concentration was around 200 mg/L each of the SBRs exhibited excellent phenol removal efficiencies > 98 % which was in accordance with the previous study Qu et al. , 2015 
 hen phenol concentration increased to 500 mg/L the SBRs treated with different concentrations of SWCNTs maintained high efficiencies of phenol removal > 98 % , while the phenol removal efficiency of G1 declined from 98.8 % to 84.0 % over the long-term operation 
 owever after 20 days of exposure the phenol removal efficiencies significantly decreased < 85 % 
 icrobial community structure analysis To identify taxonomic diversity of microbial communities from these 15 SBRs RDP identifier was employed to assign the sequence tags to different taxonomic levels from phylum to genus at 50 % threshold 
 roteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all samples accounting for 58.1–81.4 % of total sequences Fig . 3a 
 hile under CNTs shock loading conditions the abundances of Proteobacteria had almost no changes after 1 day of operation P > 0.10 but significantly decreased after 20 days P < 0.05 ( Fig . 3a 
 he abundance of Rudaea decreased when the concentration of phenol was 500 mg/L but it would be improved after the long-term operation under CNTs shock loading conditions 
 he relative abundance of Burkholderia decreased during the long-term operation while the relative abundance of Acinetobacter had a slight increase under low concentration of phenol 200 mg/L , but then decreased after long-term exposure to either high phenol concentration or CNTs shock loading Fig . 4

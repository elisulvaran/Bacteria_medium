egradative enzymes encoded in the bph operon transform chloro biphenyl to 2hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate and chloro benzoate . 2-hydroxypentadienoate is further metabolized into acetylcoenzyme A which enters the Krebs cycle . Chloro benzoate is catabolized into catechol which is further degraded into central intermediates 9 
he simplest PAH naphthalene along with some 3- and 4-ring PAHs act as growth substrates for aerobic bacteria 12 
igher PAHs are usually biodegraded cometabolically and their biotransformation yields no carbon or energy 13 
n many cases the same enzymes can transform not only naphthalene but also phenanthrene and anthracene 12 
ost of our knowledge on biodegradative processes in soil has still been based on highly Introduction Wide-spread use improper handling and disposal of certain synthetic organic chemicals have resulted in contamination of soils waters and sediments 
mong the compounds released biphenyl polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs petroleum chemicals including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs and BTEX benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes pesticides dioxins , furans , and flame retardants are of major concern 1,2 
heir presence in the environment often poses a serious risk to both ecosystem functioning and human health 
lthough biphenyl PCBs and PAHs are toxic for many higher organisms some bacteria are known to transform and/or mineralize these toxicants in the processes of bioremediation 4– 6 
nder aerobic conditions bacteria metabolize biphenyl and its monochlorinated derivatives 7 , rarely also dichlorinated ones 8 , in order to derive carbon and energy 
ncubation time of 4 days however was sufficient for cells to derive carbon from 13C-labeled benzoate and naphthalene Figure S1 . biased results of cultivation studies 
table isotope probing SIP [ 14 in contrast , enables researchers to link metabolic activity and phylogeny without previous cultivation of microbes 
pplying this method first helped describe the utilization of one-carbon compounds e.g . 14–16 and has since been used to detect microbial communities active in the utilization of a wide variety of compounds including xenobiotics reviewed by 17,18 
t the same time bottlenecks of this approach have been realized which are associated especially with the noise introduced during amplification and pyrosequencing leading to an overestimation of diversity 26 
he aim of the presented study was to identify bacterial populations in contaminated soil that derive carbon from biphenyl naphthalene and benzoate 
n addition the experimental design with labeled substrates as well as key intermediates of degradation pathways biphenyl and benzoate respectively helps clarify the flow of carbon in the contaminated soil 
he experimental design also has another advantage that it can detect abilities of strains to biodegrade multiple contaminants . Identification of Bacteria The majority of 16 S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from the contaminated soil clustered with Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria – together these two phyla represented two thirds of the sequences Figure 1 
nalyzing 13C-DNA isolated after 14-day incubation of the soil with biphenyl showed that carbon from biphenyl has been mainly utilized by the genera Rhodanobacter and Burkholderia 38 % of all sequences ( Table 2 
n addition to Rhodanobacter other Gammaproteobacteria from the family Xanthomonadaceae have been detected including Dyella and Rudaea-related populations 
he second most abundant cluster of sequences after both 4- and 14-day incubation was identical to the Rhodanobacter cluster which dominated carbon acquisition from 13C-biphenyl 
imilarly other populations were detected to derive carbon from benzoate as well as biphenyl including those associated with Burkholderia Pandoraea or Rudaea-like and Skermanella-like Proteobacteria and some Acidobacteria Table 2 Table S1 
n addition carbon from 13C-benzoate was acquired by populations of Azotobacter 3 % and 6 % sequences on day 4 and 14 respectively and Gram-positive bacilli 2 % and 7 % sequences on day 4 and 14 respectively ( Table 2 
n day 14 the peak representing heavy DNA was much smaller compared to day 4 Figure S1 and also many sequences detected in heavy DNA on day 14 were classified as 12C-background Table 1 
he major cluster of pseudomonads corresponds to the major ones detected in benzoate-amended microcosms i.e . identical populations of pseudomonads seem to acquire carbon from both benzoate and naphthalene 
any other sequences detected in 13C-DNA after naphthalene labeling were identical to those detected after biphenyl and benzoate labeling including Rhodanobacter Burkholderia Pandoraea Dyella as well as many OTUs not classified at the level of genus 
hese populations thus seem to play a key role in intrinsic bioremediation of a wider variety of aromatic contaminants in the soil . Results Stable Isotope Probing of DNA Microcosms constructed with contaminated soil and amended with 13C-labeled biphenyl benzoate or naphthalene were destructively harvested after 4 and 14 days of incubation 
abeled DNA was localized in fractions with buoyant densities 1.623–1.673 g.mL–1 as is indicated by comparing the distribution of 16 S rRNA genes in gradient fractions of unlabeled control and 13C-DNA 
hese fractions were compiled and further analyzed as 13C-DNA ‘ ‘ heavy ’ ’ DNA 
o cope with this phenomenon fractions of unlabeled control with buoyant densities of 1.623–1.673 g.mL–1 were compiled and further analyzed along with the samples 
he same trend was obvious when a subset of 10,000 reads of mock community were analyzed – using UCHIME and Perseus the total number of OTUs was 64 and 41 
fter OTUs represented by 3 or less sequences were subtracted the numbers of OTUs were reduced to 14 and 8 respectively 
pplying Perseus therefore resulted in the expected number of OTUs i.e . 8 after the exclusion of tripletons doubletons and singletons 
ther algorithms for chimera checking such as Bellerophon 33 or B2C2 34 which is a stand-alone software not implemented in mothur , had a worse performance than both Perseus and UCHIME data not shown 
herefore sequence data were processed according to commands described in Table S2 with the use of Perseus for identifying chimeric sequences . Mock Community Analysis Pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA genes of 8 strains included in our mock community was performed in order to i analyze the accuracy and efficiency of the amplification and sequencing strategy and ii determine appropriate parameters for sequence data processing 
mock community was constructed with strains from phyla Proteobacteria Actinobacteria and Firmicutes Table 3 
rom over 40,000 reads obtained by pyrosequencing a random subset of 1,000 and 10,000 sequences was chosen which was further used as a testing set for determining the appropriate analysis procedures 
etails of the analysis performed in mothur software package version 1.25 31 are described in Material and methods section 
he number of OTUs defined at 3 % distance detected in the subset differed depending on the program used to detect and remove putative chimeric sequences

n previous SIP experiments however only Burkholderia members were found to be actively deriving carbon from biphenyl 44 and benzoate 45,46 in soils 
ll other dominant populations acquiring carbon from biphenyl and benzoate directly in this soil are reported here for the first time 
seudomonads which have been reported to be the most prevailing group of bacteria to degrade complex organic compounds 52 , largely dominated carbon acquisition from labeled benzoate and naphthalene in this study 
any strains belonging to pseudomonads had been reported to degrade biphenyl and PCBs 53–56 , PAHs 12 , or other aromatic contaminants 
seudomonas spp . were also detected in other SIP experiments to utilize i naphthalene in PAH-contaminated soil 57–59 , aquifer 60 , and an aerobic bioreactor used to treat contaminated soil 61 ; ii benzoate in soil 46 ; and iii biphenyl in PCB-contaminated river sediment 62 or soil 63 
he aim of this study was to investigate which bacterial populations participate in biphenyl benzoate and naphthalene biodegradation in real long term contaminated soil 
his soil represents a unique ecosystem since it was gradually contaminated for 30 years and it has been deposited at the present location for 15 years 35 
he results of stable isotope probing experiments show that biotransformation of aromatic pollutants in this soil is mainly mediated by Proteobacteria There were populations detected that derived carbon from both labeled biphenyl and benzoate including Rhodanobacter Burkholderia Pandoraea Dyella as well as Rudaea- and Skermanella-related bacteria 
f the latter was the case one would expect similar distribution of sequences in 13 C-DNA isolated after the incubation with both labeled biphenyl and benzoate 
table isotope probing combined with ultra-deep sequencing is shown here to be a helpful tool to monitor natural attenuation and investigate bioremediation potential 
any of the metabolically active populations are as-yet uncultured and unclassified bacteria 
t the same time our results show the importance of sequencing and analyzing a mock community in order to more correctly process and analyze sequence data . Table 3

hese can be either sequences of bacteria with no cultured and studied representatives or chimeric sequences that were not removed by Perseus 
n addition to Proteobacteria bacteria lineages of Gemmatimonadetes Acidobacteria and Gram-positive bacilli were detected to derive carbon from some of the labeled aromatics 
bility to degrade several organic pollutants have already been demonstrated for genera Azotobacter Sphingomonas Bacillus and Gemmatimonas 64–67 with Bacillus and Sphingomonas being detected by SIP experiments as a benzoate 46 and biphenyl and pyrene 63,68,69 utilizers , respectively 
ontaminated soil from the locality of Lhenice has been subjected to certain phyto/rhizoremediation studies previously including isolation of biphenyl and potentially PCB degrading bacteria 
nly isolates of the genus Achromobacter however were identified in this study to be metabolically active in biphenyl biotransformation Table S1 OTU 64 and were previously obtained in pure culture 70 
n addition a time-course stable isotope probing experiment was conducted with the soil from this locality detecting Hydrogenophaga and Paenibacillus as dominant biphenyl-metabolizing genera 
et the microcosms were constructed by converting the soil into slurry and enriching biphenyl utilizers prior to stable isotope probing 50 
t was previously highlighted that pyrosequencing of amplicons can overestimate microbial diversity and the datasets need qualified processing before any conclusions are made 26

pecial attention was paid to pyrosequencing data analysis in order to eliminate the errors caused by either generation of amplicons random errors caused by DNA polymerase formation of chimeric sequences or sequencing itself 
verall the study contributes to our understanding of biodegradation processes in contaminated soil 
ompeting Interests The authors have declared that no competing interests exist . E-mail tomas.macek @ vscht.cz PCB congeners are usually biodegraded cometabolically 9–11 with biphenyl being the primary substrate 
ther lower chlorinated PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e40653 Bacteria Utilizing Aromatics in Contaminated Soil Distributions of 16 S rRNA genes in gradient fractions indicate that in case of biphenyl significant labeling was achieved on day 14 whereas on day 4 DNA was not labeled enough to be distinguished from the unlabeled control the curves have almost the same behavior 
herefore SIP is considered one of the leading molecular tools for investigating the diversity of bacteria potentially responsible for ecologically relevant processes 
or the purposes of bacterial identification the most informative approach appears to be pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA tag-encoded amplicons 
uch a realization has resulted in the introduction of several denoising algorithms or improved operational taxonomic unit OTU clustering 27–30 in order to increase data analysis exactness 
esults of the study help unveil which bacteria are potentially involved in biodegradation of aromatic pollutants 
equences of the phylum Proteobacteria were also the predominant ones retrieved from 13C-DNA . 13C-DNA obtained after a 4-day incubation with 13C-biphenyl contained less than 25 % of valid sequences Table 1 
his was caused by subtracting the majority of sequences that were also detected in the unlabeled control 
urther bacteria included in the top OTUs belonged to Alphaproteobacteria Table 2 
any of the sequences clustering with major OTUs were not classified at the level of genus suggesting a possible detection of yet-to-be described bacterial species 
ne of the major issues associated with stable isotope probing is to control for background 12 C-DNA contamination in the heavy-DNA-containing fractions 
hylogenetic identification at the phylum level of sequences retrieved from soil total community with special focus on metabolically active Proteobacteria OTUs are described in Table S1 . doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0040653.g001 3 % distance whereas using Perseus 29 , the final number of OTUs was reduced to 13 
fter normalizing sequence data the spurious OTUs were restricted to singletons only Table S1 
embers of these phyla are most commonly associated with the degradation of aromatics 
sing UCHIME 32 for checking chimeras the processing resulted in 19 OTUs defined at Table 1 
hese include some of the model PCB degrading strains Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 39,40 or Pandoraea pnomenusa formerly Comamonas testosteroni B-356 41,42 
ecently also the closest type strain to the Dyella cluster D. ginsengisoli has been described to degrade biphenyl 43 
he question remained whether such populations can be metabolically active directly in the soil which has been confirmed by our results 
n addition based on cultivation studies Rhodanobacter members were previously associated only with the degradation of PAHs 47 , chlorobenzoates 48 , or certain pesticides 49 
his paper to the best of our knowledge is the first one to report bacteria clustering with Rhodanobacter spp . to derive carbon from biphenyl 
ajor OTUs detected in 13C-DNAs were also largely detected in the total community DNA Figure 1 
n addition the OTU associated with Rhodanobacter spathiphylli was the most abundant taxon of all Table S1 
herefore these populations do not seem to be just opportunistic growers taking advantage of external substrates they were provided with during SIP but are rather regular abundant members in this contaminated soil adapted for the biodegradation of the pollutants . Discussion In order to better understand optimize and/or monitor bioremediation processes a fundamental goal has been to identify bacteria involved in biodegradation of pollutants 
uch a long time should have been sufficient for the establishment of stable microbial populations 
inking contaminant transformation to phylogenetic identity of active microbes without cultivation has thus become the main challenge 
IP is one of the available methods of functional molecular microbial ecology which can meet this challenge 38 
s a sufficient amount of labeled DNA was not achieved on day 4 compared to unlabeled control the question remains whether 13C from biphenyl was derived either directly by biphenyl degradation or indirectly via cross-feeding possibly with benzoate as a substrate 
owever the richest clusters in 13C-DNA after labeling with benzoate were associated with pseudomonads Table 2 whereas in 13C-DNA after labeling with biphenyl pseudomonads were much poorer in abundance Table S1 
herefore it seems to be more likely that the populations detected are capable of transforming biphenyl via benzoate into compounds of intermediary metabolism 
his may as well be supported by previous reports showing that members of majority PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 July 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 7 | e40653 Bacteria Utilizing Aromatics in Contaminated Soil sequences in order to accurately estimate the diversity of a sample 
n our study we applied the mock community analysis-based approach for optimization of data processing in mothur software package Table S2 
ur data processing was based on standardized operating procedure defined for the needs of Human Microbiome Project 72 , which uses UCHIME to identify chimeric sequences 
verall our data show that biotransformation of selected aromatics was mainly performed by the same populations of Proteobacteria 
esults obtained within this study bring insight into the identity of bacteria actively metabolizing contaminants in soil 
herefore this study shows the importance of cultivation-independent techniques to investigate biodegradation processes 
relatively large proportion of sequences retrieved from 13C-DNA were not classified at the level of genus 
he fact the same OTUs are often present in more samples Table 2 suggests the former to be much more likely 
lthough Ionescu et al . 71 isolated a Burkholderia member the identification was based on biochemical characteristics 16 S rRNA sequencing showed this strain to cluster with the genus Achromobacter 35 
heir total amounts have decreased over the years by natural attenuation from the firstly determined concentration of 470 mg PCBs/g soil in 1999 35 to about 100 mg PCBs/g soil in 2008 
he sum of PCBs was based solely on indicator congeners so the actual numbers of all congeners are even higher 
he soil samples for the experiment were collected from the depth of about 0.5 m in the late summer of 2008 
n such arrangement the soil was left to moisturize for 3 days in order to increase bacterial activity 
he soil was added after acetone was completely evaporated leaving behind crystals of the substrates 
ubsequently the soil was moisturized with 500 mL of mineral salt solution 50 
ottles were sealed with crimp seals with silicone septa to maintain stable atmosphere with continuous evaporation of the substrates at the beginning of the incubation . 13 C-labeled benzoate Sigma-Aldrich USA was applied directly in mineral salt solution 500 mL concentration 1 mg/mL onto the soil 
fter the incubation period triplicate samples were pooled for downstream processes to recover 13C-DNA from all three replicates at the same time . 13 CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT-39 www.rdp.cme.msu.edu [ 76 
mplicons were unidirectionally sequenced from the forward primer using GS FLX Titanium chemistry followed by amplicon analysis of signal processing Roche . C-DNA Isolation DNA was extracted with a PowerMax Soil DNA Isolation Kit MoBio Laboratories Inc. USA using the standard protocol 
fter the strains were grown overnight in liquid Luria Bertani medium Oxoid UK their genomic DNA was isolated with a PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit Invitrogen , USA 
enomic DNA samples of the selected strains were mixed so that the numbers of 16 S rRNA genes from each strain were of the same order of magnitude 
xcept some minor modifications processing was based on standardized operating procedure defined for the needs of Human Microbiome Project 72 
equences with less than 3 % sequence similarity were considered the same operational taxonomic units OTUs

n order to understand natural biodegradative processes in contaminated environments it is crucial to identify bacteria involved in pollutants metabolism 
lthough anthropogenic activity is a main source of these contaminants they can as well form during natural events 3 
heir predominance is especially obvious on day 4 
his is in agreement with results of another study 25 , in which Paenibacillus sequences were also found to dominate 13C-biphenyl-labeled DNA in tidal mudflat 
n addition some biogenic sources of PAHs have been known such as endogenic synthesis by microorganisms phytoplankton algae or higher plants 4 
ecently combination of SIP with sequence analysis of 16 S rRNA gene pyrotags has been used to probe populations associated with rapid response to soil rewetting 20 , nitrification 21 , nitrogen incorporation in petroleum-contaminated arctic soils 22 , earthworm-mediated shaping of communities 23 , toluene degradation at a tar-oilcontaminated aquifer 24 , or biphenyl-oxidation in a tidal mudflat 25 
his can be performed for instance through denoising pyrosequencing amplicon reads by exploiting rank-abundance distributions 28 , through denoising flowgrams before these are converted to sequences 29,30 , or through improved OTU clustering 27 
n order to avoid biases of culturebased approaches stable isotope probing was applied in combination with sequence analysis of 16 S rRNA gene pyrotags amplified from 13C-enriched DNA fractions 
uch a small number of sequences was expected based on data obtained from qPCR Figure S1 , which suggested there was not enough DNA labeling on day 4 
his OTU was also detected in 13 C-biphenyl labeled DNA on day 14 but was very scarce 0.3 % sequences

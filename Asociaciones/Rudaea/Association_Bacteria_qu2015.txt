he relative abundance of this genus on  296  Day 67 (3.69% in G1, 11.47-26.48% in others) was similar to that of Day 60 (Figure S11).  297  Rudaea has been identified in long-term contaminated soils with biphenyl, benzoate and  298  naphthalene, as well as in a petroleum refinery wastewater treatment plant, thus it is of  17 ACS Paragon Plus Environment  Environmental Science & Technology  Page 18 of 32  299  considerable potential for aromatics biodegradation.58,59 Meanwhile, it is also known for  300  cellulose degradation and was detected as the predominate and sensitive genus susceptible to  301  metal nanoparticles, especially nano-TiO2.60,61 In our study, the increase of Rudaea in SWCNTs-  302  treated groups might lead to improved aromatic (such as phenol) degradation capacity.  303  The abundances of Burkholderia, Singulisphaera, Mucilaginibacter and Labrys in  304  SWCNTs-treated groups were notably lower than that in G1

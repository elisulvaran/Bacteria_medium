hese were not isolated Downloaded from https //academic.oup.com/femsec/article-abstract/92/9/fiw145/2197980 by guest on 18 February 2018 cases as other organisms not observed as ubiquitous such as Marinomonas sp . also endophytes of marine plants Espinosa et al . 2010 or Sphingomonas sp. , were not detected in the soils 
axonomic study of Marinomonas strains isolated from the seagrass Posidonia oceanica with descriptions of Marinomonas balearica sp . nov. and Marinomonas pollencensis sp . nov 
inally there were certain relevant ubiquitous taxa such as Chromohalobacter canadensis Rudaea cellulosilytica never reported before as endophytic Psychrobacter sp. Bradyrhizobium sp . and Halomonas sp. that due their moderate halophilic nature , seemed to find an optimal environment inside the plants 
PUs 1 Rudaea cellulosilytica , 6 Psychrobacter spp . , 12 Chromohalobacter canadensis , 13 Halomonas spp . and 109 Bradyrhizobium spp . were present in all fractions of all plants Fig . 3 Table 2 , and in high sequence numbers 
dditionally two of the most important OPUs Psychrobacter sp . and Rudaea cellulosilytica had notable abundance variations in the red fractions being higher and lower respectively in these more mature parts of the plant in comparison with other areas of the endosphere

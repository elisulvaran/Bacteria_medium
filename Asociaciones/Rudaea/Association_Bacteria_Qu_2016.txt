he abundance of Rudaea decreased when the concentration of phenol was 500 mg/L, but it would be improved after the long-term operation under CNTs shock loading conditions 
revious studies have indicated that genus Rudaea was detected in soil and activated sludge contaminated with aromatic compounds, such as biphenyl, naphthalene and phenol (Uhlik et al., 2012; Qu et al., 2015) 
hus, Rudaea could have a considerable potential in bioremediation of aromatic pollutants (such as phenol)

n response to phenol and CNTs shock loadings Rudaea Burkholderia Sphingomonas Acinetobacter Methylocystis and Thauera became dominant genera which should be involved in phenol removal 
mong the dominant genera Zoogloea and Haliscomenobacter could be related to sludge settling properties while Rudaea Burkholderia Acinetobacter Methylocystis Thauera and Sphingomonas could play important roles in phenol degradation 
he abundance of Rudaea decreased when the concentration of phenol was 500 mg/L but it would be improved after the long-term operation under CNTs shock loading conditions 
revious studies have indicated that genus Rudaea was detected in soil and activated sludge contaminated with aromatic compounds such as biphenyl naphthalene and phenol Uhlik et al. 2012 Qu et al. 2015 
hus Rudaea could have a considerable potential in bioremediation of aromatic pollutants such as phenol 
he dominant genera Rudaea Burkholderia Acinetobacter Methylocystis Thauera and Sphingomonas should be more responsible for the high efficiency of phenol removal 
udaea was detected in all treatments with considerably high abundance 5.6â€“22.0 % ( Fig . 4

ezgui and others Here the isolation and characterization are reported of a novel strictly anaerobic moderately halophilic heterotrophic spore-forming bacterium belonging to the family Clostridiaceae which originated from a hydrocarbonpolluted soil surrounding a deep petroleum environment located in the El Faouar area in south Tunisia 
amples were collected in sterile tubes from a hydrocarbonpolluted soil surrounding a deep petroleum environment located in the El Faouar area in south Tunisia transported to our laboratory and stored at 4 uC until analysis 
amples were collected at the surface of the soil 0–2 cm deep and the pH of the soil was 6.8 
his enrichment medium was boiled under a stream of O2-free N2 gas and cooled to room temperature and 5 ml aliquots were then distributed into Hungate tubes under a stream of O2-free N2 gas 
he N2 gas phase was replaced with N2/CO2 80 20 and the tubes were autoclaved 
o initiate enrichment cultures a small portion of the soil sample was inoculated into the growth medium and incubated at 37 uC without agitation 
he Hungate technique was then used throughout isolation and study for physiological and metabolic characterization 
nrichment cultures showed growth after 24 h incubation at 37 uC and microscopic examination revealed the presence of motile rod-shaped bacteria 
rowth was determined by inserting culture tubes directly into a model Cary 50 Scan spectrophotometer Varian and measuring the OD580 
ultures were purified by repeating the Hungate roll-tube method Hungate 1969 and using enrichment medium solidified with 2 % w/v agar Difco 
everal colonies were picked and cultured in the corresponding culture medium 
everal axenic cultures were obtained using this process and one strain named SOL3f37T was used for further characterization 
ells of strain SOL3f37T were straight thin and long rods 0.565.0–10.0 mm that grew singly or in pairs 
pherical and terminal spores were observed mainly in old cultures 
he other major components were identified as iso-C14 0 3-OH and/or iso-C15 0 dimethyl acetal DMA 21.6 % , iso-C13 0 4.4 % , anteiso-C15 0 3.9 % , iso-C15 1 2.8 % and one major component that remained unidentified ( 12.5 % 
train SOL3f37T did not grow in anaerobic enrichment medium containing traces of oxygen as indicated by the pink-coloured resazurin in the growth medium and was therefore described as a strict anaerobe

itrate and nitrite utilization tests were carried out in triplicate in butyl-capped Hungate tubes filled with 5 ml pre-reduced medium without resazurin and Na2S distributed under a nitrogen atmosphere 
hese tests were carried out under similar conditions without pre-reducing the medium and without a nitrogen atmosphere for oxygen utilization 
he sulfur test was carried out photometrically as colloidal CuS Fardeau et al. 1997 and nitrate/nitrite reduction was assayed using specific sticks Quantofix Macherey-Nagel 
he universal primers Fd1 59-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-39 and Rd1 59AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC-39 were used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene

he phylogenetic tree obtained by the neighbour-joining method Saitou & Nei 1987 is shown in Fig . 2 its topology was supported by the maximumparsimony and maximum-likelihood algorithms not shown . 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of strain SOL3f37T revealed that it was a member of the family Clostridiaceae of the order Clostridiales as defined in the currently proposed taxonomy in Bergey ’ s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology Wiegel 2009

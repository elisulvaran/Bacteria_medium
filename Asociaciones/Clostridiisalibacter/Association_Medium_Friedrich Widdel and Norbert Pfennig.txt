alt-requiring acetate-oxidizing sulfate reducers which morphologically resembled the brackish water and marine forms could also be enriched from village ditches far away from the sea coast (region of H a n n o v e r and Konstanz, Bodensee), when sterile brackish water medium was used 
ith freshwater medium such sulfate reducers could not be enriched; but when grown once well in brackish water medium, they developed further in freshwater medium, although to lower densities.  Morphology Stoichiometric Measurements and Cell Material Determination 
o avoid major changes ofpH with sulfate or sulfite as electron acceptor, small calculated volumes of sterile HC1 were added during growth, in the case of sulfite always before addition of the electron aceeptor 
omplete reduction of added sulfate was shown by addition of BaC12 solution after acidification of part of the medium 
o BaSO4 turbidity occurs with sulfate-free media or when sulfate is completely reduced.  Results  Enrichments and Isolation Enrichment studies with anaerobic freshwater medium containing acetate as sole organic substrate and sulfate as electron acceptor showed, that the sulfate-reducing bacteria which could be isolated under these conditions were always of the Desulfotomaculum acetoxidans type (Widdel 1980; Widdel and Pfennig 1981)

omplete reduction of the added sulfate was shown by the BaC12 method 
pparently, salt-requiring acetate-oxidizing sulfate reducers are widespread in marine sediments and belong to the regular anaerobic marine microflora (Laanbroek and Pfennig 1981) 
his conclusion is in agreement with the turnover measurements of other authors who showed that the way of terminal anaerobic decomposition of organic matter, particularly of acetate, depended on the availability of sulfate as external electron acceptor 
n freshwater sediments, where sulfate occurs in limited amounts, methane and CO2 are the predominant anaerobic end products (Winfrey and Zeikus 1977; Fallon et al. 1980) 
n marine sediments, however, complete anaerobic oxidation of organic matter via dissimilatory sulfate reduction is possible (Cahet 1975; hbrgensen 1977; Abram and Nedwell 1978; Oremland and Taylor 1978; Mountfort et al. 1980) 
owever, after adaptation to lower salt concentrations, growth was also possible in freshwater medium showing that these sulfate reducers were not as strictly dependent on higher NaC1 and MgCI2 concentrations as the strains isolated from brackish water or marine habitats.  Bioenergetical Aspects of SulJate Reduction with Acetate Growth yields of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the presence of different electron acceptors were determined by Senez (1962) and Vosjahn (1970) with pyruvate as electron donor; this substrate allows ATP formation by substrate phosphorylation in addition to electron transport 
he measurements showed that growth yields with pyruvate plus sulfate and pyruvate plus sulfite were identical 
rowth yields with thiosulfate were about 2 to 3 times higher than with sulfate as electron acceptor 
rom maximal growth yields, which were obtained by extrapolation to infinite growth rates, it was concluded that the reduction of 1 tool sulfate with 4tool H 2 is associated with a net synthesis of i tool ATP 
hus, ATP formation for synthesis of cell material appears to occur with similar efficiency during growth on both electron acceptors sulfate or sulfite; with thiosulfate the efficiency was slightly higher 
ulfate activation via APS is sometimes understood as an energyconsuming process in the sense that a considerable part of free energy is wasted as entropy to allow sulfate activation 
n the other hand, sulfate reduction with acetate is a reaction the free energy of which is only low [Eq. (1)] 
o allow net synthesis of ATP, highly irreversible reaction steps during acetate oxidation and sulfate reduction should be avoided or kept minimal by the cells 
f sulfate activation would result in a waste of a larger part of the total free energy, this should become apparent in a marked decrease in efficiency of the relatively low exergonic oxidation of acetate with sulfate as compared to sulfite as electron acceptor 
he results presented here show, however, that growth on acetate plus sulfate is not less efficient than growth on acetate plus sulfite 
hese results urge upon the question whether the hydrolysis of pyrophosphate liberated during sulfate activation via APS is obligate, or whether pyrophosphate may not be removed by immediate use as an ATP equivalent for special phosphorylations 
n the experiments of Badziong and Thauer (1978) the electron donor for the reduction of sulfate was H a and not acetate 
he highest growth yield obtained with H2 was 8.3 g cell dry weight per mol of sulfate, which is more than the growth yield of 4.8 g per tool of sulfate and acetate measured by us 
f Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Desulfobacterpostgatei are comparable, these results can be related to the AG ~ value, which is - 152.2 kJ per mol sulfate when four mol H2 are the electron donor (Badziong and Thauer 1978) but only -71.7 kJ per mol sulfate when acetate is the electron donor

he membrane pellet was washed ofice with 5ml phosphate buffer and centrifuged again 
he membrane pellet was resuspended in 8 ml phosphate buffer (membrane fraction) 
n our experiments acetate was the electron donor which on the basis of present biochemical knowledge - does not allow net synthesis of ATP by substrate phosphorylation (an energy-rich phosphate bond formed in a hypothetical tricarboxylic acid cycle would be required for the activation of free acetate)

tarting with sulfate-freemedium and the same acetate concentration of 20.0 mmol per 1in each case, the electron acceptors sulfate, sulfite or thiosulfate were added in different exactly known growth limiting amounts from stock solutions

Stoichiometry o f Acetate Oxidation  Discussion  Complete anaerobic oxidation o f acetate was shown by growth experiments with strain 2ac9 in the presence of equal initial concentrations of acetate (20.0 mmol/1) and different growth-limiting concentrations of sulfate, sulfite or thiosulfate

 synthesis of 3 tool ATP was calculated for the reduction of 1 mol thiosulfate; from a bioenergetical point of view, the same amount of ATP should be synthesized during reduction of 1 tool sulfite with 3 tool H2 
evertheless, the growth yields on acetate allow some considerations on the energetics of the reduction of different electron acceptors.  The grams cell dry weight of Desulfobacterpostgatei strain 2ac9 formed per kilojoule free energy [see Eqs. (1), (2a) and (3)] were 0.067 g/kJ with acetate and sulfate, 0.068 g/kJ with acetate and sulfite and 0.088 g/kJ (highest value) with acetate and thiosulfate

he pH of the medium (normally between 7.1 and 7.3) was adjusted with sterile diluted HC1 or Na2CO 3 solution

urther enrichment cultures with acetate were inoculated with anaerobic mud samples from brackish water and marine habitats 
o account for their higher salinity, basal media with higher concentrations of NaC1 and MgC12 were used (brackish water and marine medium)

etermination of the D N A base ratio of strain 2ac9 by thermal denaturation yielded a content of 45.9 tool % guanine + cytosine.  in g o o d agreement with the following equations [Eq. (2a) is Eq.

 result which cannot yet be understood is that saltrequiring acetate oxidizers, which resemble brackish water or marine forms, occur also far away from the sea coast 
ne may conclude, that net ATP formed during electron transport by a given number of electrons does not only depend on the kind of the sulfur compound being reduced but also on the energy level of the electron donor: Electrons derived from H2 of I atm appear to allow higher phosphorylation yields than electrons derived from acetate 
ince all three strains did never show spore formation under any conditions, they cannot be classified together with the existing acetateoxidizing, sporing bacterium of the emended .genus  400  Desulfotomaculum ( 3 7 . 5 m o l % GC)

fter inoculation immediately before sealing, 0.2-0.6ml of a freshly prepared, anaerobically filtersterilized dithionite solution with 50 g Naa $204 per 1were added per 1 of medium; alternatively, dithionite was also added as dry crystals (10- 30 mg/l) with a sterile spatula

hen well growing, young cultures were transferred (about 5 inoculum) to fresh media, growth started immediately without addition of dithionite

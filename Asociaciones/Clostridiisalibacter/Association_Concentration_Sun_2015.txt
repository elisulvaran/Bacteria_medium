 or example mesophilic anaerobic digestion MAD took 30 to 40 days to eliminate an approximately 50 % of the initial mass of the sludge for methane production whereas only 11 to 14 days were required for the same results under thermophilic conditions Zbransk et al . 2000 
 he prokaryotic sequencing libraries shared 152 out of 22 254 OTUs 0.68 % of the total that have been observed in the four treatments 
 he fungal sequencing libraries shared 39 out of 7345 OTUs 0.53 % of the total that have been observed in the four treatments 
 rchaeal reads accounted for 6.0 % of the total reads indicating a relatively small amount of archaeal reads occurring in the libraries compared to bacterial reads 
 evertheless Basidiomycota was the most dominant phylum in DSF0 79.4 % 
 t is noteworthy that all these three fungal orders only occurred with low levels in two mesophilic libraries < 2 % , suggesting that they might be enriched by the temperature increase 
 n contrast the genus of Leptosphaerulina 81 % in SWF0 which dominated in mesophilic conditions , decreased its abundance notably at the elevated temperatures 
 or example standard node 0.01 shows that this size would represent 1 % of the corresponding genus in a group 
 tandard node 0.2 shows that this size would represent 20 % of the corresponding genus in a group microbial communities by selecting these microorganisms able to adapt to the thermal environment 
 tandard node 0.5 shows that this size would represent 50 % of the corresponding genus in a group Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 2015 99:10271–10282 observations were supported by previous studies where Firmicutes has also been detected in the extreme thermophilic environments Emmerich et al . 2012 Orcutt et al . 2010 
 hese fungal phyla only constituted a minor fraction in the total fungal reads 2.3 % overall 
 acillus was the most abundant genus 23.22 % in SWDT but only accounted for 0.1 % in SWD0 indicating that a temperature increase remarkably facilitated the growth of Bacillus species

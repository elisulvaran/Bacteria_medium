MW presents a high organic load, including sugars, tannins, polyphenols, polyalcohols, pectins, lipids and a wide variety of simple aromatic compounds resulting from olive cell-wall degradation during the oil extraction process (Balice & Cera, 1984; Hamdi, 1993; Labat et al., 2000; Lesage-Meesen et al., 2001) 
his effluent is discharged directly into sewage systems and water streams, despite the fact that such disposal methods are prohibited in many Mediterranean countries 
icrobiological studies on OMW or digesters treating these wastes have revealed the presence of metabolically diverse anaerobic bacteria (Mechichi et al., 1998, 1999a, b, 2000; Chamkha et al., 2001a, b; Thabet et al., 2004), all of which are anaerobic species belonging to the order Clostridiales and affiliated to the genus Clostridium

he Hungate technique (Hungate, 1969) was used throughout the isolation procedure and the physiological and metabolic characterization 
he basal medium was boiled under a stream of O2-free N2 gas, cooled to room temperature, and 5 ml aliquots were distributed into Hungate tubes under a stream of O2-free N2 gas

ositive enrichment cultures were obtained after 7 days incubation at 37 uC, and microscopic examination revealed the presence of motile, rod-shaped bacteria 
ingle colonies (0.8–1.0 mm diam.), which developed in the roll tubes after 96 h incubation at 37 uC, were picked up and tenfold serial dilutions were performed in the roll tubes at least twice before the culture was considered to be pure 
everal axenic cultures were obtained using this procedure, and one strain, named 37HS60T, was used for further characterization 
train 37HS60T was a straight, thin, long rod (0.5 mm63.0–8.0 mm), motile by means of peritrichous flagella (Fig. 1a), that stained Gram-positive and formed spherical and terminal spores (Fig. 1b) which appeared mainly in old cultures 
t exhibited a thick and stratified cell wall composed of dense multilayers, including a cytoplasmic membrane and an atypical thick and multilayered peptidoglycan, covered by an S-layer (Fig. 1c) 
he fatty acids detected were iso-C17 : 1v10c or anteiso-C17 : 1v3c (19.3 %), C14 : 0 (14.3 %), C16 : 1v7c (9.9 %), C16 : 1v7c DMA (8.5 %), C16 : 0 (7.6 %) and a weak proportion of diverse fatty acids (Table 1) 
 large proportion of both the major and weak fatty acids, as well as unknown fatty acids which are listed in Table 1, are rarely encountered and this atypical profile was unexpected for a Gram-positive bacterium

hese tests were realized under similar conditions without pre-reducing the medium and without a nitrogen atmosphere to measure oxygen utilization 
rowth of strain 37HS60T was inhibited by the addition of three different classes of antibiotic compounds: chloramphenicol (25 mg ml21), penicillin G (300 mg ml21) and streptomycin (150 mg ml21).

he universal primers Fd1 (59CAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-39) and R6 (59TACGGTTACCTTGTTACGAC-39) were used to amplify the SSU rRNA gene 
eference sequences were obtained from the Ribosomal Database Project II (Maidak et al., 2001) and GenBank databases (Benson et al., 1999)

ther related species that exhibited ,90 % similarity were Clostridium acidurici ATCC 7906T and Thermohalobacter berrensis CNCM 105955T (89.7 and 89.1 %, respectively) 
ccording to its phylogenetic position and the value accepted as the criterion for the delineation of different species (Stackebrandt & Goebel, 1994), our novel isolate probably represents a novel species and a novel genus in cluster XII of the Clostridiales, since its  phylogenetic distance was equal to or lower than 92.0 % from Caloranaerobacter azorensis DSM 13643T and Clostridium purinilyticum DSM 1384T 
his is strongly supported by important differences in genetic and physiological traits (Table 2) 
qually, strain 37HS60T differs physiologically from Caloranaerobacter azorensis in terms of carbohydrates used, temperature and NaCl concentration ranges for growth 
train 37HS60T was able to grow at temperatures up to 50 uC and is thermotolerant (optimum 42 uC), although it was unable to grow at 55 uC, while C. azorensis has an optimal temperature for growth of 65 uC 
n addition, unlike Caloranaerobacter azorensis, strain 37HS60T was unable to grow on starch or any other sugar and unable to produce H2S from sulfur 
econdly, strain 37HS60T differed from Clostridium purinilyticum (Dürre et al., 1981) in terms of purine use, temperature range and NaCl concentration for growth 
ence, Clostridium purinilyticum is a mesophilic, non-halophilic species, whereas strain 37HS60T is thermotolerant and moderately halophilic 
y contrast, strain 37HS60T is not purinolytic and degrades some amino acids, unlike Clostridium purinilyticum which degrades only glycine

hylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain 37HS60T fell within the evolutionary radiation enclosed by cluster XII of the Clostridium subphylum 
he type strain is 37HS60T (5JCM 14354T5CCUG 53849T).  Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is a major environmental problem in the Mediterranean region, where more than 36107 m3 of this residue is produced annually

hylogenetically, however, the genus still embraces a high number of organisms from many different genera that are not defined by Clostridium-specific phenotypes (Cato & Stackebrandt, 1989; Lawson et al., 1993; Rainey & Stackebrandt, 1993; Rainey et al., 1993; Collins et al., 1994; Stackebrandt & Rainey, 1997; Stackebrandt et al., 1999; Stackebrandt & Hippe, 2001) 
espite some reclassification, the genus Clostridium remains a phylogenetically heterogeneous entity, containing a core cluster (I) of more than 60 species, while the remaining species form several independent phylogenetic lineages, in which species are sometimes closely related to organisms which are classified in different genera 
ere, we describe a novel species of a novel genus belonging to the order Clostridiales, cluster XII, which is an anaerobic, mesophilic, halophilic, heterotrophic, sporeforming bacterium, isolated from an OMW evaporation pond located in Marrakesh, Morocco 
ormerly, these ponds were old underground galleries, called khettaras, which brought water for irrigation of the desert

n addition, the DNA G+C content of Caloranaerobacter azorensis (27.0 mol%) is 6 mol% lower than strain 37HS60T 
oreover, the optimum growth temperature of 37HS60T (42 uC) is the maximal temperature for Clostridium purinilyticum 
n addition, the DNA G+C content of Clostridium purinilyticum (29.0 %) is 4 mol% lower than strain 37HS60T

oprothermobacter Bacillus Haloplasma Clostridiisalibacter Methanobacterium Methanothermobacter Saccharomycetales Candida Alternaria Cladosporium and Penicillium were found almost exclusively in TAD suggesting their adaptation to thermophilic conditions and ecological roles in digesting the organic compounds 
n SWDT Bacillus Haloplasma Proteiniphilum Clostridiisalibacter and Caldicoprobacter occurred at high levels > 5 % relative abundances 
n addition the abundances of Bacillus Haloplasma Clostridiisalibacter and Caldicoprobacter increased notably at thermophilic conditions whereas the number of Proteiniphilum dropped significantly with a temperature increase 
embers of the genera Bacillus Haloplasma Ruminiclostridium Proteiniphilum Clostridiisalibacter and Caldicoprobacter occurred at high levels in SWDT 
mong these genera Bacillus Haloplasma Clostridiisalibacter and Caldicoprobacter increased their relative abundances in SWDT as compared to SWD0 
ther genera such as Haloplasma Clostridiisalibacter and Caldicoprobacter increased their abundances with temperature increase suggesting that they may contain thermophilic microorganisms 
lostridiisalibacter paucivorans have been detected in deep-sea hydrothermal environments Jiang et al . 2015 .Caldicoprobacter contained several thermophilic species such as Caldicoprobacter oshimai Yokoyama et al . 2010 , Caldicoprobacter algeriensis Bouanane-Darenfed et al . 2011 and Caldicoprobacter guelmensis Bouanane-Darenfed et al . 2013

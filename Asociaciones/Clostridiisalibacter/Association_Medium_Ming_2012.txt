ccording to the latest edition of Bergey ’ s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology Wiegel 2009 strain BMT should be classified into the family Clostridiaceae within the order Clostridiales , and probably represents a novel species of a new genus 
enotypic and phenotypic traits suggest that strain BMT is distinct from its phylogenetic relatives Table 2 
train BMT differed from T. berrensis CTT3T Cayol et al. 2000 and Caloranaerobacter azorensis MV1087T Wery et al. 2001 in that the latter strains are thermophilic and hence were not included in Table 2 with optimal growth temperatures of 65 uC , whereas the upper temperature for growth of strain BMT was 44 uC

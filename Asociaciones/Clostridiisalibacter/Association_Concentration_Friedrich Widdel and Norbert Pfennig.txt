 ith sulfate the average growth yield was 4.8 g cell dry weight per tool o f acetate dissimilated obtained from a linear plot , while the average growth yield with sulfite was 10.8 g cell dry weight per mol acetate 
 ith thiosulfate as electron acceptor the highest growth yield obtained was 10.4 g cell dry weight per tool of acetate oxidized growth yields slightly decreased with increasing thiosulfateconcentrations . Stoichiometry o f Acetate Oxidation Discussion Complete anaerobic oxidation o f acetate was shown by growth experiments with strain 2ac9 in the presence of equal initial concentrations of acetate 20.0 mmol/1 and different growth-limiting concentrations of sulfate sulfite or thiosulfate 
 he molar ratios between acetate dissimilated and HzS formed from either sulfate sulfite or thiosulfate are Ecological Aspects Attempts to enrich for acetate-oxidizing sulfate-reducing bacteria from anaerobic m u d samples o f freshwater habitats were succesful only in few cases 
 evertheless the growth yields on acetate allow some considerations on the energetics of the reduction of different electron acceptors . The grams cell dry weight of Desulfobacterpostgatei strain 2ac9 formed per kilojoule free energy see Eqs . 1 2a and 3 ] were 0.067 g/kJ with acetate and sulfate , 0.068 g/kJ with acetate and sulfite and 0.088 g/kJ highest value with acetate and thiosulfate 
 he highest growth yield obtained with H2 was 8.3 g cell dry weight per mol of sulfate which is more than the growth yield of 4.8 g per tool of sulfate and acetate measured by us 
 f Desulfovibrio vulgaris and Desulfobacterpostgatei are comparable these results can be related to the AG ~ value which is 152.2 kJ per mol sulfate when four mol H2 are the electron donor Badziong and Thauer 1978 but only -71.7 kJ per mol sulfate when acetate is the electron donor

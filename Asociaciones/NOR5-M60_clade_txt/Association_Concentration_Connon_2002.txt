 heir approach was to dilute natural communities of microorganisms to a known number ranging from 1 to 10 cells per tube and then examine these potential cultures for microbial growth by flow cytometry which is effective for counting very dilute populations of cells 
 y this method bacterioplankton culturability from 2 to 60 % was reported for marine waters around Alaska and The Netherlands 10 
 n the day water was collected it was filtered through a 0.2-␮m-pore-diameter Supor membrane and immediately autoclaved 
 ater samples for inocula were collected on the south side of the southern jetty in Newport Oreg. at high tide with a bucket and at 8 km 44°39.1N 124°10.6W and 25 km 44°39.1N 124°24.7W offshore from the mouth of Yaquina Bay Oreg. with a Niskin bottle deployed at 5 m 
 noculum samples were diluted into the prepared seawater medium and distributed as 1-ml aliquots into 48-well non-tissue-culture treated Polystyrene plates Becton Dickinson Franklin Lakes N.J. to a final average inoculum ranging from 1.1 to 5.0 cells per well 
 he extinction cultures were incubated for 3 weeks and the agar cultures were incubated until colonies were large enough to count about 1 week for MA2216 and up to 8 weeks for 1/10R2A 
 ercent culturability was determined by the equation for estimation of culturability V ⫽ ⫺ln 1 ⫺ p /X and the theoretical number of pure cultures was estimated by the equation u ⫽ ⫺n 1 ⫺ p ln 1 ⫺ p described by Button and colleagues 10 where u is an estimation of the expected number of pure cultures n is the number of inoculated wells V is estimated culturability , p is the proportion of wells positive for growth wells positive for growth/total inoculated wells , and X is the initial inoculum of cells added per well 
 o calculate the error first the exact lower and upper 95 % confidence limits for the binomial proportion p were determined by using the SAS package version 6.12 SAS Institute Inc . 
 ext these exact limits were put into the culturability equation and pure culture equation in place of the term p to give the exact lower and upper 95 % confidence limits for percent culturability and the theoretical number of pure cultures 
 wo to 5 ␮l of each concentrated sample was added to the first PCR which had a 20-␮l reaction volume and 2 to 5 ␮l of the first PCR was added to the second PCR which had a 60- to 100-␮l reaction volume

n this study, the organization of PGCs was analyzed in ten AAP species belonging to the orders Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales and the NOR5/OM60 clade 
phingomonadales contained comparatively smaller PGCs with an approximately size of 39 kb whereas the average size of PGCs in Rhodobacterales and NOR5/OM60 clade was about 45 kb 
he distribution of four arrangements, based on the permutation and combination of the two conserved regions bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puhABC and crtF-bchCXYZ, does not correspond to the phylogenetic affiliation of individual AAP bacterial species 
hile PGCs of all analyzed species contained the same set of genes for bacteriochlorophyll synthesis and assembly of photosynthetic centers, they differed largely in the carotenoid biosynthetic genes 
pheroidenone, spirilloxanthin, and zeaxanthin biosynthetic pathways were found in each clade respectively 
ll of the carotenoid biosynthetic genes were found in the PGCs of Rhodobacterales, however Sphingomonadales and NOR5/OM60 strains contained some of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway genes outside of the PGC 
onclusions/Significance: Our investigations shed light on the evolution and functional implications in PGCs of marine aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs, and support the notion that AAP are a heterogenous physiological group phylogenetically scattered among Proteobacteria

oth aerobic and anaerobic anoxygenic phototrophs have most of the photosynthetic genes organized in a so-called photosynthesis gene cluster (PGC) [13] 
he PGC contains genes for the photosynthetic reaction center, light harvesting complexes, BChl and carotenoid biosynthesis, as well as some regulatory factors 
wo conserved subclusters, crt-bchCXYZ-puf (about 10 kb) and bchFNBHLM-IhaA-puh (about 12–15 kb) were identified in PGCs of different phototrophic Proteobacteria [14–16] 
he orientation of the genes in each subcluster was the same, although the gene order could vary slightly (e.g. pufBA and pufLM) 
hey harvest light using bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a and various carotenoids serving as auxiliary pigments 
ultureindependent studies have shown that marine AAP bacterial communities are mostly represented by Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria [4,5] 
ost cultured marine Alphaproteobacterial AAPs belong to Roseobacter clade and the order Sphingomonadales, which includes members of the genera Erythrobacter and Citromicrobium [6–8] 
AP bacterial isolates related to Gammaproteobacteria belong to the clade NOR5/OM60 which contains Congregibacter litoralis KT71 [9,10] and strain HTCC2080 [11] 
ootstrap percentages from both neighbor joining (above nodes) and maximum parsimony (below nodes) are shown

he fact that the PGC is a stable part of the phototrophs genome is also indicated also by the fact that the phylogenetic trees constructed for 16S rRNA, pufM gene and concatenated PGC core genes show basically the same topology (Fig. 1 and Fig 
2).  Despite its diversity, complexity and functional importance for AAP bacteria, a detailed investigation of the gene and operon arrangement of PGC has not been performed in their entirety 
n this study, we analyzed the structure and arrangement of PGC in the AAP bacterial genomes available to date, with the aim of addressing the frequency of homologous gene recombination as well as the differences in carotenoid gene composition and biosynthetic pathways.  Results and Discussion  The structure and arrangement of PGC  Ten fully sequenced AAP species were analyzed for their photosynthetic genes and PGC composition 
ccording to phylogenetic analysis using both 16S rRNA and pufM genes, the ten strains were classified into three main groups: Roseobacter clade (order Rhodobacterales), Erythrobacter-Citromicrobium clade (order Sphingomonadales) and NOR5/OM60 clade (Gammaproteobacteria) (Fig. 1) 
oseobacter clade contained six strains belonging to five genera: Roseobacter (Rsb.) denitrificans OCh 114 [18] and Rsb. litoralis Och 149 [19], Loktanella vestfoldensis SKA53, Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL12 [20], Jannaschia sp 
CS1, and Roseovarius sp. 217 [21] 
AP1 [7] and Citromicrobium sp 
wo species were members of Gammaproteobacteria: Congregibacter (Cb.) litoralis KT71 [9,10] and marine Gammaproteobacterium HTCC2080 [11] 
phingomonadales contained comparatively smaller PGCs (,39 kb) whereas the average size of PGCs in Rhodobacterales and NOR5/OM60 clades was about 45 kb  The PGCs have a mosaic structure and consist of five main sets of genes: bch genes encoding enzymes of BChla biosynthetic pathways, puf operons encoding proteins forming the reaction centers, puh operons involved in the RC assembly, crt genes responsible for biosynthesis of carotenoids and various regulatory genes

owever in NOR5/OM60 clade, puhABC and puhE are located together and ascF is at a site near BLUF 
n downstream puh genes, there are hemN (NOR5/OM60 clade) or hemA (Roseobacter and Sphingomonadales clade) [29,30].  exception was L. vestfoldensis SKA53, in which some photosynthetic genes are located outside the PGC and spread throughout the genome 
reviously it was reported that the PGC in Rsb. litoralis Och 149 is located on a linear plasmid, with two RPA genes between bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puh and crtF-bchCXYZ-puf, which act as a centromere-like anchor when plasmids replicate [19,23] 
AP1 and Citromicrobium sp 
L354 (order Sphingomonadales) is almost identical in terms of gene arrangement and composition 
hen compared to Roseobacters, this group contains less carotenoid genes and no light-harvesting 2 (LH2) genes 
imilarly, PGCs of two NOR5/OM60 strains have very comparable gene composition and organization 
wo conserved gene arrangements are found in all analyzed PGCs: bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puhABC and crtF-bchCXYZ (Fig. 2) 
ccording to their direction and order, the ten PGCs can be divided into three groups: Type I (forward bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puh plus forward crtF-bchCXYZ-puf) includes Rsb. denitrificans OCh 114 and Rsb. litoralis Och 149 
b. litoralis KT71, Gammaproteobacterium HTCC2080 and Roseovarius sp. 217 belong to type II (forward bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puh plus reverse crtF-bchCXYZ-puf), and the last five organisms form type III (forward crtF-bchCXYZ-puf plus forward bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puh)

here are four conserved regions in PGCs for BChl a expressing of AAP bacteria: bchFNBHLM, bchCXYZ, bchIDO and bchOP 
here are carotenoid genes between bchCXYZ and bchIDO, except in D. shibae DLF 12 and Jannaschia sp 
he region between bchOP and bchFNBHLM is of variable sequences in different AAP bacteria clades 
n Roseobacter clade and Sphingomonadales, there are two regulators (ppsR and ppaA) which are sensitive to light intensity and oxygen concentration [24] 
n NOR5/OM60 clade, a crtJ gene was found, which controls aerobic repression of BChl, carotenoid, and LH2 gene expression [25,26] 
our structural types of puf gene organization were observed in the ten PGCs: pufQBALMC, pufQBALM, pufBALM and pufLMCBA 
nlike the purple non-sulfur species Rba. sphaeroides and Rba. capsulatus, all the AAP strains studied lack the pufX gene in the PGC 
he pufQ gene, is absent in the puf operon of NOR5/OM60 and Sphingomonadales clades 
n addition, Sphingomonadales and L. vestfoldensis SKA53 do not have a pufC gene 
XPS is part of a mevalonate-independent pathway for isopentenylpyrophosphate (iPP) biosynthesis, a precursor for carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis [27] 
nterestingly, a switch of order in the puf gene cluster is observed in NOR5/OM60 clade (pufLMC-BA) compared to the other two AAP clades (pufBA-LMC).  PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org  The composition and organization of carotenoid genes in PGC The main difference among analyzed PGCs was found in the genes encoding the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway

AP1. 4, C. bathyomarinum JL354. 5, NOR5 clade (Cb. litoralis KT71 and Gammaproteobacterium HTCC2080 included) 
he gene CrtK is not included in the Table as it does not participate in any known carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0025050.t002  N  4  September 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e25050  Diverse Arrangement of Photosynthetic Gene Cluster  and crtCDEF in Jannaschia sp 
omparably, crtICDEF and crtCDF are missing in NOR5/OM60 clade and order Sphingomonadales, respectively 
he re-arrangement of crt genes may result from events of gene duplication and loss, accounting for the absence of crtA gene in Sphingomonadales and NOR5 clade (Table 2), and duplication of some of the crt genes, such as the crtE and crtIB found outside the PGC in Bradyrhizobium sp 
his is consistent with the closer phylogenetic relationship of these two organisms to Roseobacter related photoheterotrophic species (Fig. 1 and Fig 
he central biosynthetic pathway for carotenoids in the Roseobacter clade is the spheroidene pathway (Fig. 3, Table S1), and all the necessary genes (crtAIBCDF) for it are located in the PGCs (Fig. 2 and Table 2) 
ight is harvested by other pigments such as bacteriorubixanthinal, zeaxanthin and b-carotene [39] 
nterestingly, the key genes (crtY and crtZ) for zeaxanthin pathway are not organized in the PGCs, but are spread throughout the chromosome (Table 2) 
eaxanthin is then a starting intermediade for synthesis of both nostoxanthin (in genus Citromicrobium) and erythroxanthin (in genus Erythrobacter) (Fig. 3) 
here are two possible options for spirilloxanthin biosynthesis: typical-spirilloxanthin biosynthestic pathway and unusual-spirilloxanthin pathway (Fig. 3) 
wo conserved regions bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puhABC and crtF-bchCXYZ, were identified in all studied PGC 
he composition of bch, puf and puh genes in the analyzed PGCs was relatively similar, and the main difference was found among crt genes 
uch variability was mainly connected with different carotenoid biosynthetic pathways present in AAP groups: spheroidenone biosynthetic pathway in Roseobacters, zeaxanthin pathway in Sphingomonadales and spirilloxanthin pathway in gammaproteobacterial NOR5/OM60 clade 
ur investigation shed light on the evolution and functional implications of PGCs of marine aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs.  Six strains were used for pigment analyses: Rsb. denitrificans OCh 114 (DSM 7001), Rsb. litoralis Och 149 (DSM 6996) and Erb. longus DSM 6997 were purchased from the DSMZ culture collections

L475 were isolated and maintained in the laboratory [22] 
he grown cells were harvested by centrifugation and extracted using 100% methanol (in the case of Sphingomonadales species) or 7:2 (vol:vol) acetone-methanol (in the case of Roseobacter species) 
he pigment extract and analysis were done by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described previously [41]

(PPT)  gene sequences collected from NCBI database were aligned using Clustal X and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining and maximum-parsimony algorithms of MEGA software 3.0 [40] 
he phylogenetic trees were supported by bootstrap for resampling test with 1000 replicates.  Pigment analyses  Ten full-length PGC sequences and gene locations were obtained from the GenBank genome database

ompeting Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. * E-mail: jiao@xmu.edu.cn  Compared to the oxygenic phototrophs, the anoxygenic species contain a relatively simple photosynthetic apparatus, which consists of a reaction center surrounded by one to three types of antenna complexes [12] 
espite the fact that the basic set of genes in PGC is conserved, the gene organization of operons in PGC largely varies among different AAP bacterial lineages 
nterestingly, the  Introduction Aerobic anoxygenic photototrophic (AAP) bacteria represent an important group of marine microorganisms inhabiting the euphotic zone of the ocean 
ymbols ‘‘w’’ represents the pufM sequences from whole genome sequence 
he whole PGC’s of the ten strains highlighted in boxes were also analyzed (Fig. 2) 
urther investigation indicated that such gene organization is crucial for environmental adaptation [14].  regulatory elements such as the transcriptional regulator ppsR gene were conserved as well, suggesting that the operons in the PGCs are co-expressed 
he GC content in the PGCs varied from 52.9% to 66.7%, which was similar to the total GC contents of corresponding genomes (Table 1) 
wo species belonged to the order Shingomonadales: Erythrobacter sp 
he PGCs represented roughly 1% of the genomes (Table 1) 
ost of them came from the BChl a biosynthetic pathway 
he majority of Roseobacter-related species contained all the puf genes organized in pufQBALMC operon, which is involved in the assembly of the photosynthetic units 
haA, encoding a possible LHI assembly protein [28], occupies the upstream region of puh genes 
he presence of a smaller number of photosynthetic genes in Sphingomonadales is consistent with the smaller size of their PGCs (Table 1) 
t contains less transcriptional regulators compared to the other groups 
or example, the Roseobacter clade shows all three PGC arrangement types observed in AAP genomes 
he gene encoding 1deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) is always located downstream of puf genes in the Roseobacter clade 
owever, the organization of the crt operon in Roseobacter clade is most variable among PGCs (Fig. 2) 
he genes located in the PGC are marked by ‘‘ ’’; the genes outside PGC are marked by ‘‘#’’ 
his indicates the presence of the same carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in all Rhodobacterales 
irst, b-carotene is produced from lycopene by the action of lycopene cyclase (crtY gene product) 
hile some of the carotenoids serve as harvesting pigments, most of them do not participate in the light harvesting likely having a photoprotection function [32,33] 
s suggested earlier, spheroidenone is the main light harvesting carotenoid in Roseobacters [34–36] (Table S1) 
he biosynthetic pathways are proposed based on the identification of respective genes in the analyzed genomes. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0025050.g003  PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org  5  September 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 9 | e25050  Diverse Arrangement of Photosynthetic Gene Cluster  step hydroxylation of b-carotene catalyzed by b-carotene hydroxylase (crtZ gene product) 
he major carotenoids in Cb. litoralis KT71 is spirilloxanthin, the same as in Rhodospirillum rubrum DSM 467T [10] (Table S1) 
nterestingly, the gene crtD was found to be out of PGC in Cb. litoralis KT71 (Table 2), indicating that Cb. litoralis KT71 might use the shorter unusual-spirilloxanthin pathway 
n summary, this study showed that most of the photosynthetic genes in AAP species were organized in the PGC 
ased on their orientation we can divide the studied strains into four different groups

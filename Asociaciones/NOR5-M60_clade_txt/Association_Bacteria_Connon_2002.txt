OCPN-5 is a cultured strain, not a clone.  OM43 clade is a sister clade to a group of marine methylotrophs that includes Methylophilus and Methylobacillus and is commonly found in clone libraries from coastal sites, but not the open ocean (28) 
ethylophilus and Methylobacillus are classified as type I methylotrophs, which use the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway for carbon assimilation 
hese included three subgroups: the SAR92 clade (15 isolates), the OM60/OM241 clade (3 isolates), and one group from the genus Pseudomonas 
ur results cannot easily be explained by this “bottle effect,” because (i) the cells were diluted into the 48-well plates between 1 and 4 h after collection from the jetty and within 9 h after collection from the boat; (ii) readily culturable genera, such as Pseudomonas and Vibrio, were rarely detected in our cultures; and (iii) four previously undescribed lineages were grown by our culture method

ells were then DAPI stained and vacuum filtered onto a 48-by-60-mm 0.2-␮mpore-diameter white polycarbonate membrane (cut from 8-by-10-in. sheets; Whatman Nuclepore, Newton, Mass.) 
hort sequences of HTCC isolates were added to the tree by using the parsimony insertion tool in ARB 
TCC230 and HTCC234 are close to full length and were put in the original tree 
owever, not all of the HTCC sequences used in the tree are part of the subset of 47 identified cultures. (A) ␣-Proteobacteria phylogenetic tree. ␤- and ␥-Proteobacteria were used to root the tree; 1,051 characters were used to infer the tree. (B) ␤-Proteobacteria phylogenetic tree. ␥-Proteobacteria isolates were used to root the tree; 789 characters were used to infer the tree. (C) ␥-Proteobacteria phylogenetic tree. ␤-Proteobacteria isolates were used to root the tree; 1,042 characters were used to infer the tree.  3884  CONNON AND GIOVANNONI  APPL 
n an effort to culture the uncultured phylotypes from oligotrophic marine ecosystems, we developed high-throughput culturing procedures that utilize the concept of extinction culturing to isolate cultures in small volumes of low-nutrient media 
mong the microorganisms cultured were four unique cell lineages that belong to previously uncultured or undescribed marine Proteobacteria clades known from environmental gene cloning studies 
his method proved successful for the cultivation of previously uncultured marine bacterioplankton that have consistently been found in marine clone libraries 
he results indicate that these newly developed HTC techniques yield isolates of many novel microbial strains, including members of previously uncultured groups that are believed to be abundant in coastal seawater.  * Corresponding author 
his method, which allows a large number of culture attempts to be efficiently screened for growth and identified, was successful in bringing four major uncultured or undescribed groups of bacterioplankton into culture 
he images shown are from the original extinction dilutions that yielded the four previously uncultured and undescribed groups (Fig. 2) 
he ␥ portion of the SAR92 clone sequence represents a previously uncultured phylogenetic clade, we have termed the SAR92 clade 
ercent similarities of the sequenced HTCC cultures from the four previously uncultured or undescribed phylogenetic clades were determined, in which several of the sequences were close matches to clones in GenBank (Table 4) (2, 5, 33) 
he goal of this study was to evaluate a culturing format for the highthroughput isolation of uncultured strains of bacterioplankton that are commonly found in gene clone libraries from marine environments 
everal other major uncultured groups that are thought to be abundant in surface seawater, such as the SAR86 and SAR116 clusters, did not appear among the HTCC isolates 
he approach we describe can be used to target specific bacterial groups for cultivation by screening cultures for the microorganisms of interest by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization, so that uncultured targets can be sought in a deliberate manner 
he term “the great plate count anomaly” was coined by Staley and Konopka in 1985 (31) to describe the difference in orders of magnitude between the numbers of cells from natural environments that form colonies on agar media and the numbers countable by microscopic examination (18) 
nother explanation for the “great plate count anomaly” is that many of the microbial species that dominate in natural settings are not adapted for growth in media containing high concentrations of complex organic carbon 
his method uses unamended  environmental water as the medium and is often referred to as “extinction culturing” to distinguish it from dilution culturing, which also uses natural water, but involves complex microbial communities (1, 11, 23) 
heir approach was to dilute natural communities of microorganisms to a known number, ranging from 1 to 10 cells per tube, and then examine these potential cultures for microbial growth by flow cytometry, which is effective for counting very dilute populations of cells 
he maximum cell concentration attained (1.6 ⫻ 106 cells/ml) is similar to the natural bacterial numbers in seawater, which ranged from 8.1 ⫻ 105 to 5.6 ⫻ 106 cells per ml for the 11 inoculum samples collected 
he use of microtiter dishes and a novel technique for making cell arrays enabled us to achieve a higher throughput rate, shorten incubation times, and raise sensitivity for the detection of cells with low growth rates relative to those in previous studies that employed the concept of extinction culturing in natural media 
hylogenetic identification of the isolates provided striking evidence that extinction culturing in microtiter dishes, with natural seawater and low thresholds of detection, results in the cultivation of microbial groups that appear in environmental clone libraries, but have not been previously detected in culture 
hylogenetic analysis of a natural marine bacterioplankton population by rRNA gene cloning and sequencing 
he water was held in darkness at ambient sea surface temperatures until the processing of samples began, within 1 to 4 h after collection from the jetty and within 9 h after collection off the boat to avoid bottle effects (14) 
acterial rhodopsin: evidence for a new type of phototrophy in the sea 
n these experiments, marine bacteria were isolated and cultivated at in situ substrate concentrations—typically 3 orders of magnitude less than common laboratory media 
pproximately 2,500 extinction cultures from 11 separate samplings of marine bacterioplankton were screened over the course of 3 years 
arine ecosystems are a well-studied example of this phenomenon: only 0.01 to 0.1% of oceanic marine bacterial cells produce colonies by standard plating techniques (19) 
his hypothesis does not explain the substantial discrepancy between 16S rRNA genes recovered from seawater directly by cloning and those of the readily cultured marine taxa (22, 34) 
utton and colleagues pioneered an approach that has been successful in isolating novel oligotrophic, heterotrophic cells from marine ecosystems (10) 
y this method, bacterioplankton culturability from 2 to 60% was reported for marine waters around Alaska and The Netherlands (10) 
ver the course of 3 years and 11 separate samplings of marine bacterioplankton, 2,484 extinction wells were examined for growth 
ome of the isolates that were cultured belong to phylogenetic clades that are highly abundant in marine clone libraries 
lones in the SAR11 clade are abundant in clone libraries made from surface marine waters around the world (17) 
he OM60/OM241 clades are frequently found in coastal marine clone libraries, and the SAR92 clade is found in open ocean as well as coastal clone libraries 
urther innovations in the HTC approach will be needed to close the gap between culture collections and the microbial species dominating marine bacterioplankton communities

oth genes have high similarity to the cphA genes in the Gammaproteobacteria Colwellia psychoerythraea 34H and Francisella tularensis (59% and 56% identity for the long CphA and 33% and 30% amino acid identity for the short CphA⬘, respectively) 
he inability to gain additional energy by the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds may be due to the lack of several sox genes compared with the exemplary cluster of sox genes found in the genome of Paracoccus pantotrophus or S. pomeroyi (30) 
he LHC II complex proteins were most closely related to those of Rhodopseudomonas palustris (65% and 69% sequence identity in amino acids; best blast hit).  Fig. 1 
chla was identified by retention-time coinjection of a Bchla standard from Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides (Sigma–Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) and spectrography at 384 nm 
uture experiments should also address starvation survival, because Breznak et al. (21) could show that the survival half-time of the facultative anaerobic anoxygenic phototroph Rhodospirillum rubrum (Alphaproteobacteria) was ⬇29fold longer if grown with ambient-light intensities than without light 
ubstrate utilization tests indicate that KT71  prefers complex substrate mixture for growth (e.g., yeast extract or Trypticase peptone), whereas many monomeric substrates given as sole source of carbon and energy are used a little or not at all 
T71 was routinely grown and maintained either in the oligotrophic MPM-m medium described by ref. 1 (see SI Tables 3–7 for details) or in the complex medium SYPG containing the following compounds per liter of distilled water: 35.0 g of sea salts, 0.5 g of yeast extract, 0.25 g of Trypticase peptone, and 0.1 g of sodium L-glutamate 
hereby, in temperate coastal systems like the German Bight, marine microorganisms are faced with pronounced fluctuations of multiple parameters such as substrate, nutrient, and oxygen concentrations, as well as light levels on a daily and seasonal scale 
hylogenetic affiliation of KT71. (A) Parsimony tree of the NOR5/ OM60 clade including representative neighboring clades within the Gammaproteobacteria. (B) Consensus tree of the NOR5/OM60 clade reconstructed with 86 almost-full-length sequences (⬎1,350 nt) 
eanwhile, representatives of the NOR5/OM60 clade were also isolated from Arctic sea ice (11) and coastal sediments (12, 13) 
here, KT71 may thrive on low-molecular-weight substrates like peptides or lipids that accumulate on the sea floor (41) 
tilization of substrates was tested in a mineral medium containing (per liter) 35.0 g of sea salts, 0.1 g of NH4Cl, 0.05 g of K2HPO4, and 10 ml of a vitamin solution (see DSMZ medium 141, www.dsmz.de)

he genome analysis of C. litoralis strain KT71 identifies the gammaproteobacterial marine AAnPs, postulated based on BAC sequences, as members of the NOR5/OM60 clade 
T71 enables future experiments investigating the importance of this group of gammaproteobacterial AAnPs in coastal environments. marine bacteria 兩 NOR5/OM60 clade 兩 whole genome analysis 兩 Congregibacter litoralis 兩 bacteriochlorophyll a  I  n 1999, Eilers et al. (1) isolated a bacterial strain designated KT71 from a surface water sample taken near the North Sea island Helgoland, by direct plating on complex low-nutrient media 
urrently, the alphaproteobacterial Roseobacter clade is considered to be the dominant group of marine AAnPs (35, 51, 52) 
he genome analysis of C. litoralis strain KT71 identifies this microorganism as a cultured representative of the gammaproteobacterial marine AAnPs, enabling future experiments investigating the importance of gammaproteobacterial AAnPs in coastal environments by using KT71 as a model organism 
t is becoming more clear that photoheterotrophy is widespread among marine microorganisms (17, 44) 
enome-wide fluctuations of the GC-skew, AT-skew, GC-content, DNA curvature and DNA bending, (SI Fig. 4) were computed with custom PERL scripts and the programs banana and btwisted from the EMBOSS suite (55), respectively, and visualized with GeneWiz (56)

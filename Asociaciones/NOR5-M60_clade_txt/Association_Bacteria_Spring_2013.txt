his sequence cluster was recognized as a distinct lineage within the class Gammaproteobacteria and designated as OM60 [9,10] or NOR5 clade [11] 
pplication of the latter primer set allowed the amplification of the pufLM genes of Rap1red and all other available photoheterotrophic members of the OM60/ NOR5 clade, but not from H. rubra and species described as non-pigmented 
MC Microbiology 2013, 13:118 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118  sequence of strain HTCC2246 is available, but it belongs like HTCC2148 to the NOR5-8 branch within the OM60/ NOR5 clade, which does not contain any known phototrophic representatives so far (Figure 1) 
n evolving specialization to a distinct type of metabolism could be also reflected in the observed reduction of the genome size among photoheterotrophic members of the OM60/ NOR5 clade: The genomes of C. litoralis and Rap1red have an estimated size of 4.3 and 4.2 million base pairs (Mb), whereas in the strains HTCC2080, Ivo14T and Himb55, which all belong to the NOR5-1 lineage considerably smaller genome sizes of 3.6, 3.3 and 2.7 Mb, respectively, were found 
pplying the lower threshold value to the OM60/ NOR5 clade, it turns out that only the closely related strains C. litoralis DSM17192T and Rap1red belong to the same genus, sharing a pufLM nucleotide sequence identity value of 82.7% 
mong members of the OM60/ NOR5 clade genes for urease and cyanophycin synthetase are so far only found in the latter two strains and can therefore be used for the delineation of the genus Congregibacter from other BChl a-containing taxa.  Conclusions In summary, molecular and phenotypic data support the affiliation of the photoheterotrophic strains Ivo14T, Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T, H. rubra DSM 19751T and C. litoralis DSM 17192T to different genera within the OM60/NOR5 clade 
equences of the primer set pufLF2/pufMR2 were optimized to match known sequences of BChl a-containing members of the OM60/ NOR5 clade 
mplification of soxB genes  For detection of the sulfate thiol esterase subunit (SoxB) of the periplasmic sox enzyme complex the primers soxB432F-2 and soxB1446B-2 were designed, which are based on primers proposed previously [63], but with some modifications to match known soxB gene sequences of representatives belonging to the OM60/ NOR5 clade

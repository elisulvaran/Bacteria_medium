t was designated SYPHC medium and has the following composition (per liter demineralized water): 35.00 g sea salts, 0.10 g NH4Cl, 0.05 g KH2PO4, 2.50 g HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid), 1.00 g yeast extract, 1.10 g sodium pyruvate, 0.04 g L-histidine, 0.04 g L-cysteine-HCl × H2O, 1.00 ml Wolfe’s mineral elixir (see DSMZ medium 792) [58], and 1.00 ml vitamins solution (see DSMZ medium 503) [58] 
ignificantly higher ratios were obtained upon cultivation of these strains in complex media containing malate and yeast extract, which may be due to the storage of reserve polymers

n Figure 3A a phylogenetic tree based on pufLM gene sequences belonging to several distinct groups of Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria is shown 
n this tree sequences of Chromatocurvus halotolerans and all genome-sequenced representatives of the OM60/NOR5 clade form a monophyletic group together with several cloned pufLM gene sequences retrieved from environmental samples thereby indicating that the photosynthetic reaction center genes within this group were derived from a common ancestor 
nly the clustering of H. rubra with Chromatocurvus halotolerans in the pufLM based tree represents a discrepancy with the 16S rRNA phylogeny 
he clustering of H. rubra with Chromatocurvus halotolerans confirms the results obtained by comparison of the pufLM genes, but is in conflict with the 16S rRNA based phylogenetic tree 
 phylogenetic lineage closely related to the OM60/NOR5 cluster was originally defined by a 16S rRNA gene sequence  retrieved from deep sea sediment and designated BD1-7 [13] 
owever, this would be highly unlikely, because strain HTCC2246 like most other known members of the OM60/NOR5 clade is a marine bacterium, which was isolated from the open sea water and not from soil 
ossible reasons could be that they remained either dependent on nutrient-rich sites for successful proliferation or are specialized on recalcitrant carbon sources [42] resulting in a more restricted distribution and lower frequency in sea water

he revealed high genotypic and phenotypic diversity of closely related strains within this phylogenetic group reflects a rapid evolution and frequent niche separation in the OM60/NOR5 clade, which is possibly driven by the necessities of an adaptation to oligotrophic marine habitats 
eywords: Phylogeny, Aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotroph, Proteorhodopsin, Mixotroph, Picoplankton, Coastal marine environment  Background Aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic bacteria use light as additional energy source for mixotrophic growth and play a significant role in the microbial ecology of marine environments [1,2] 
he existence of aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic gammaproteobacteria in marine environments was first postulated in a study by Béjà et al. [5], who could identify photosynthesis genes in partial genome sequences of gammaproteobacteria retrieved from seawater off the coast of California (USA) 
 few years later the two marine isolates HTCC2080 and KT71T were independently identified as aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic gammaproteobacteria by proteomic analyses [6] and genome sequencing [7], respectively 
hylogenetically, C. litoralis is affiliated to a large coherent cluster of 16S rRNA gene sequences, which were mainly retrieved by cultivation-independent methods from marine habitats around the world 
n this study, a comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the novel isolate Ivo14T was performed that allowed a detailed comparison to other bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a-containing members of the OM60/NOR5 clade, so that a profound knowledge of the metabolic plasticity and taxonomic relationships encountered in this ecologically important group of marine gammaproteobacteria could be obtained.  Results and discussion Isolation and identification of mixotrophic representatives of the OM60/NOR5 clade  An isolation strategy originally designed for the retrieval of strains belonging to the genus Rhodopirellula within the Planctomycetales resulted in the isolation of numerous representatives of the OM60/NOR5 clade of marine gammaproteobacteria [13,25] 
 similar phenomenon was reported previously for the oligotrophic marine alphaproteobacterium Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique [28] 
onsequently, we speculate that the results reported by Cho et al. [6] may have been caused by a contamination of the analyzed samples with cells or DNA of phototrophic alpha- or betaproteobacteria inhabiting freshwater or soil, but not marine environments 
ossibly, a further adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus to the conditions of aerobic marine environments in members of the NOR5-1 lineage led to a rapid diversification and speciation process in this subclade, reflected by a high number of microdiverse 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from marine surface waters 
robably, the optimization of anoxygenic photophosphorylation under aerobic conditions gave representatives of the NOR5-1 lineage a selective advantage, which enabled them to play a significant role in the euphotic zone of coastal marine environments

owever, it can be assumed that unlike BChl a-dependent photophosphorylation that allows an increase of growth yield by the utilization of light [8,32], light-driven proton pumping by membrane-embedded proteorhodopsin does not have this effect, at least in the marine alpha- and gammaproteobacteria studied so far [43,44] 
ccording to current knowledge proteorhodopsin in marine proteobacteria only helps to survive periods of starvation, i.e. in the absence of a suitable carbon source or essential nutrients like iron or phosphorous, but does not promote proliferation in cases when the amount of an available carbon source limits growth [28,45] 
epresentatives can be found in seawater and the surface layer of littoral marine sediments

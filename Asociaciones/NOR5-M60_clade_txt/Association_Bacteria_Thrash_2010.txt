ata annotated independently with GenDB are also accessible in the Marine Microbial Genomics database at Oregon State University (http://bioinfo.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/microbes/).  Strains HTCC2148 and HTCC2080 are members of the important OM60/NOR5 clade of the oligotrophic marine Gammaproteobacteria (OMG), which includes the aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotroph Congregibacter litoralis KT71 in addition to many species of chemoheterotrophs (6, 7)

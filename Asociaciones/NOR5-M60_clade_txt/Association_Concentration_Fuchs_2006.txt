 gene-by-gene comparison of the BAC clones EBAC65D09 EBAC29C02 and EBAC69B03 with KT71 showed a high average sequence identity on the amino acid level of 56 % 55 % and 62 % respectively Fig . 2 SI Table 1 
 oth genes have high similarity to the cphA genes in the Gammaproteobacteria Colwellia psychoerythraea 34H and Francisella tularensis 59 % and 56 % identity for the long CphA and 33 % and 30 % amino acid identity for the short CphA⬘ respectively 
 raig Venter Institute 9704 Medical Center Drive Rockville MD 20850 and ¶International University Bremen Campusring 1 D-28759 Bremen Germany Members of the gammaproteobacterial clade NOR5/OM60 regularly form an abundant part up to 11 % of the bacterioplankton community in coastal systems during the summer months 
 he strain grows optimally under microaerobic conditions and actively places itself in a zone of ⬇10 % oxygen saturation 
 ctive DNA synthesis could be detected in August but not in May 2002 even though NOR5/OM60 was present in high numbers in both samples 6 % and 11 % of total bacterioplankton cell respectively ( 14 
 he LHC II complex proteins were most closely related to those of Rhodopseudomonas palustris 65 % and 69 % sequence identity in amino acids best blast hit . Fig . 1 
 igments found after consecutive acetone and methanol extractions followed by HPLC analysis showed the typical profiles for bacteriochlorophyll a Bchla with the main peaks at 360 580 and 776 nm Fig . 3A and a carotenoid-like compound with absorption maxima at 470 494 and 532 nm respectively Fig . 3B 
 wo flasks containing 960 ml of minimal MPM-m medium were inoculated with 4 ml of a stationary-phase culture and incubated for 4 wk at room temperature 
 he position of the visible cell layer depended on the substrate concentration in the medium and was closer to the surface at higher substrate concentrations 
 wo highly similar genes coding for cyanophy- cin synthetases were found in tandem KT71㛭18591 and KT71㛭18596 38 % identical amino acids 
 ore recent studies have shown that AAnPs may be less important in the open ocean ⬇1 % 48 but can reach up to 15 % abundance in eutrophic and mesotrophic coastal areas ( 49 50 
 he genome of KT71 contains ⬇4.36 Mb with an average GC content of 57.7 % and is deposited under GenBank accession no 
 T71 was routinely grown and maintained either in the oligotrophic MPM-m medium described by ref . 1 see SI Tables 3–7 for details or in the complex medium SYPG containing the following compounds per liter of distilled water 35.0 g of sea salts 0.5 g of yeast extract 0.25 g of Trypticase peptone and 0.1 g of sodium L-glutamate 
 chla was identified by retention-time coinjection of a Bchla standard from Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides Sigma–Aldrich Taufkirchen Germany and spectrography at 384 nm 
 y the end of July 1998 up to 8 % of the total bacterioplankton community comprised members of the NOR5/ OM60 clade 1

 ignificant amounts of Bchla were detected only in cultures of KT71 growing with light on the oligotrophic MPM-m 1 medium for an extended time bacteriochlorophyll concentration of 680 ␮g䡠liter⫺1 after 4 mo 
 rom the culture grown with light from a 60-W light bulb 32.4 mg of cell mass dry weight could be harvested whereas from the parallel culture grown in the dark only 17.6 mg of cell mass dry weight could be obtained 
 nterestingly in direct vicinity to the second BLUF sensor KT71㛭09447 a two component response regulator KT71㛭09452 could be found suggesting , that this BLUF sensor forms part of a two component system SI Table 2 
 o determine the exact oxygen concentration for optimal growth Fuchs et al . of KT71 oxygen profiles were measured in cultures grown in SYPG medium with 0.15 % wt/vol agar soft agar 
 t has been estimated that AAnPs account for ⱖ10 % of the bacterioplankton community in the oligotrophic open ocean 45–47 
 he discovery of BAC clones with PS operons showing best BLAST hits to Gammaproteobacteria 17 clearly suggested the existence of a second group of AAnPs

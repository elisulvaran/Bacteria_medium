dditional reports on NOR5/OM60 sequences come from environments with different salinity: freshwater rivers [54,57], a rice paddy (DQ830363), freshwater sediments [44,61], activated sludge [32], soil [25,40], and also from  hypersaline environments [24,36,52]

n contrast to earlier trees based on less sequences [11,22] the current reconstruction of the NOR5/OM60 clade now also includes, besides the sequences from strain KT71 and clones OM60 and OM241, a cluster of freshwater clones and BD2-7, a clone retrieved from the deep sea

n 1997, two almost fulllength sequences were found to be closely related to SAR125; clones OM60 (U70696) and OM241 (U70702) were from a marine coastal site off North Carolina, USA [51] 
n 1999, strain KT71 (AY007676) was isolated from marine surface water at the ‘‘Kabeltonne’’ station off the island of Helgoland, North Sea [19] 
ased on comparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis, the NOR5/OM60 clade is most closely related to the genera Endobugula, Microbulbifer, Teredinibacter (all Alteromonadales), Cellvibrio (Pseudomonadales) and several other groups of oligotrophic marine Gammaproteobacteria, including the clades BD1-7, KI89A, OM182 and SAR92 [11] 
he goals of this study were to provide a more detailed description of the phylogeny of the  125  NOR5/OM60 clade and to analyze its geographic distribution, as well as abundance, in the marine environment 
ith this, the abundance of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade was quantiﬁed in coastal marine sites off China, Namibia, Spain, and Germany, as well as in an open-ocean transect in the North Atlantic.  Materials and methods Sequence retrieval NOR5/OM60-related 16S rRNA sequences were initially retrieved with the ARB program (http:// www.arb-home.de/) [43] from the SILVA database (Version 91) [50] (http://www.arb-silva.de/) by targeting group-speciﬁc signatures (e.g. complement to probe NOR5-730 with 0–2 mismatches)

hey currently comprise only a few sequences, including those of the NEP isolates obtained from Japanese marine coastal sediments [45], and an isolate from coastal marine water sampled off Banyuls-sur-Mer [1,2] 
o far, only 14 isolates have been reported from marine water or coastal marine sediment (SI Table 4) 
he large subclades NOR5-1 and NOR5-4 appeared almost exclusively in the marine water column 
equences of the other NOR5/OM60 subclades were retrieved from marine sediment and the water column 
he NOR5/OM60 clade is cosmopolitan in the marine realm 
herein, 28 belonged to subclade NOR5-1, which is typical of marine surface water, and two belonged to its sister subclade NOR5-4 
hese two probes were subsequently used at this formamide concentration in combination with helpers NOR5-659h, NOR5-709h, NOR5-1217h and NOR51287h for a speciﬁc and sensitive identiﬁcation of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade in environmental samples.  Quantiﬁcation of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade by CARD-FISH The cells detected by CARD-FISH with the probe mixture NOR5-730/NOR5-1238 in marine plankton and benthos samples were pleomorphic (Fig. 4), often from coccoid to rod-shaped, sometimes were also bent  in a vibrio shape 
he optimized NOR5-730/NOR5-1238 probe/helper mixture was subsequently used for CARD-FISH-based quantiﬁcations in various marine samples 
n the brackish to marine Yangtze River estuary (salinities of 22–32 psu), between 0% and 2.3% of all DAPI-stained cells were detected 
he counts were mostly at a depth of 10 m, with the exception of the two easternmost points that were at a depth of 15 m.  Discussion The interest in the NOR5/OM60 clade has signiﬁcantly increased with the discovery that this clade encompasses the elusive marine gammaproteobacterial branch of AAnPs [12,22]

evertheless, these data cannot be directly translated into cell frequencies since the number of rRNA operons per genome is quite different in marine bacteria [31] 
ost of them appear in the euphotic zone in the marine water column and they are positively related to high chlorophyll concentrations [15,30,53,56,62] 
he four strains isolated from marine surface waters KT71 (NOR5-3), HTCC2080 (NOR5-1B), HTCC2246 (not grouped) and HTCC2148 (NOR5-8) were shown to contain genes pufL and pufM coding for light-harvesting complex I (LHC I) 
hey have assessed the diversity of marine AAnPs based on comparative analysis of pufM sequences retrieved from the metagenomic libraries of the GOS [52] 
hese were from coastal samples, whereas the pufM of the alphaproteobacterial Roseobacter-type was found throughout the samples, and, additionally, as yet unidentiﬁed groups of AAnP seemed to dominate pelagic marine waters [62].

he NOR5/OM60 group and the AAnPs showed some common features for distribution, at least in some regions: they both occurred at a higher percentage in coastal water compared to the open ocean, and they were more abundant in summer or autumn than in winter or spring 
owever, considering the rather high 16S rRNA sequence diversity within the NOR5/OM60 clade and its broad habitat range, it cannot be taken for granted that all members of NOR5/OM60 are AAnPs

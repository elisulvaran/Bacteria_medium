iovannoni* Department of Microbiology, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon 97331 Received 4 March 2002/Accepted 16 May 2002  Microbial diversity studies based on the cloning and sequencing of DNA from nature support the conclusion that only a fraction of the microbial diversity is currently represented in culture collections 
n these experiments, marine bacteria were isolated and cultivated at in situ substrate concentrations—typically 3 orders of magnitude less than common laboratory media 
icrotiter plates and a newly developed procedure for making cell arrays were employed to raise the throughput rate and lower detection sensitivity, permitting cell enumeration from 200-␮l aliquots of cultures with densities as low as 103 cells/ml 
hese cultures are related to the clades SAR11 (␣ subclass), OM43 (␤ subclass), SAR92 (␥ subclass), and OM60/OM241 (␥ subclass) 
he term “the great plate count anomaly” was coined by Staley and Konopka in 1985 (31) to describe the difference in orders of magnitude between the numbers of cells from natural environments that form colonies on agar media and the numbers countable by microscopic examination (18) 
his hypothesis does not explain the substantial discrepancy between 16S rRNA genes recovered from seawater directly by cloning and those of the readily cultured marine taxa (22, 34) 
utton and colleagues pioneered an approach that has been successful in isolating novel oligotrophic, heterotrophic cells from marine ecosystems (10) 
his method uses unamended  environmental water as the medium and is often referred to as “extinction culturing” to distinguish it from dilution culturing, which also uses natural water, but involves complex microbial communities (1, 11, 23) 
heir approach was to dilute natural communities of microorganisms to a known number, ranging from 1 to 10 cells per tube, and then examine these potential cultures for microbial growth by flow cytometry, which is effective for counting very dilute populations of cells 
y this method, bacterioplankton culturability from 2 to 60% was reported for marine waters around Alaska and The Netherlands (10) 
his work resulted in the description of two new oligotrophic bacterioplankton, Sphingomonas alaskensis and “Cycloclasticus oligotrophus” (9, 29, 37, 39) 
ver the course of 3 years and 11 separate samplings of marine bacterioplankton, 2,484 extinction wells were examined for growth 
 series of protocols and techniques were developed to allow the efficient screening of a large number of extinction culture attempts for growth  MATERIALS AND METHODS  3878  VOL. 68, 2002  FIG. 1

icrotiter plates were used to culture cells, and cell arrays were made to allow efficient screening of the plates for growth 
n the day water was collected, it was filtered through a 0.2-␮m-pore-diameter Supor membrane and immediately autoclaved 
cid-washed polycarbonate containers were used for media and live samples whenever possible 
issolved organic carbon concentrations of the seawater media were 107.1 ␮M (standard deviation [SD], 1.1) for the 19 March 1998 collection, determined with a Shimadzu TOC-500, and 91.6 ␮M (SD, 1.6) for the 7 June 2000 collection, determined with a Shimadzu TOC-5000A (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) 
noculum collection, dilution, and incubation 
ater samples for inocula were collected on the south side of the southern jetty in Newport, Oreg., at high tide with a bucket and at 8 km (44°39.1N, 124°10.6W) and 25 km (44°39.1N, 124°24.7W) offshore from the mouth of Yaquina Bay, Oreg., with a Niskin bottle deployed at 5 m 
he water was held in darkness at ambient sea surface temperatures until the processing of samples began, within 1 to 4 h after collection from the jetty and within 9 h after collection off the boat to avoid bottle effects (14) 
o determine viable cell counts (i.e., culturability) by traditional methods, inocula of 50 or 100 ␮l of seawater were applied to spread plates of MA2216 (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.), Marine R2A (R2A) (34), and a 1/10 dilution of Marine R2A (1/10R2A) 
noculum samples were diluted into the prepared seawater medium and distributed as 1-ml aliquots into 48-well non-tissue-culture treated Polystyrene plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.) to a final average inoculum ranging from 1.1 to 5.0 cells per well 
he 48-well plates and agar plates were incubated in the dark at 16°C 
he extinction cultures were incubated for 3 weeks, and the agar cultures were incubated until colonies were large enough to count, about 1 week for MA2216 and up to 8 weeks for 1/10R2A 
ells were then DAPI stained and vacuum filtered onto a 48-by-60-mm 0.2-␮mpore-diameter white polycarbonate membrane (cut from 8-by-10-in. sheets; Whatman Nuclepore, Newton, Mass.) 
he membrane was laid on an oiled 75-by-50-mm slide (Corning Glass Works, Corning, N.Y.) and covered with a 48-by-60-mm coverglass (Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, N.H.) 
ercent culturability was determined by the equation for estimation of culturability, V ⫽ ⫺ln(1 ⫺ p)/X, and the theoretical number of pure cultures was estimated by the equation u ⫽ ⫺n(1 ⫺ p) ln(1 ⫺ p) described by Button and colleagues (10), where u is an estimation of the expected number of pure cultures, n is the number of inoculated wells, V is estimated culturability, p is the proportion of wells positive for growth (wells positive for growth/total inoculated wells), and X is the initial inoculum of cells added per well 
o calculate the error, first, the exact lower and upper 95% confidence limits for the binomial proportion (p) were determined by using the SAS package version 6.12 (SAS Institute Inc.) 
ext, these exact limits were put into the culturability equation and pure culture equation in place of the term p to give the exact lower and upper 95% confidence limits for percent culturability and the theoretical number of pure cultures 
FLP analysis and sequencing of HTCC isolates 
 subset of 56 HTCC isolates were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and rRNA gene sequencing methods 
ne hundred or 200 ␮l of culture was put through two cycles of freezing and thawing to promote cell lysis and concentrated in a 10,000-molecular-weight Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience, Stonehouse, United Kingdom) 
he lysates were then rinsed three times with 200 ␮l of Ultrapure water (Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, N.J.) to remove medium salts and lysis buffer 
wo to 5 ␮l of each concentrated sample was added to the first PCR, which had a 20-␮l reaction volume, and 2 to 5 ␮l of the first PCR was added to the second PCR, which had a 60- to 100-␮l reaction volume 
he PCR cocktail for both reactions contained 0.025 U of Taq per ␮l (Promega, Madison, Wis., or MBI Fermentas, Hanover, Md.), 5% acetamide, 1.5 mM Mg2⫹, 200 nM each primer, 220 ␮M deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTP), and 1⫻ PCR buffer (Promega or MBI Fermentas) 
he length of UV treatment needed was empirically determined by amplifying a set of negative and positive controls 
he amplification conditions for both PCRs were 94°C denaturation for 30 s, 50 to 55°C (depending on primers used) annealing for 1 min, and 72°C extension for 2 min 
he primers used were 8F (5⬘-AGR GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG-3⬘), 519F (5⬘-CAG CMG CCG CGG TAA TWC-3⬘), 1395R (5⬘-ACG GGC GGT GTG TRC-3⬘), 1492R (5⬘-GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3⬘), and 1522R (5⬘AAG GAG GTG ATC CAN CCR CA-3⬘), which are variations of commonly used primers that target bacteria or prokaryotes (21) 
he nested set of primers most frequently used was made up of 519F/1492R and 519F/1395R, but other variations of the listed primers were also used

TCC isolates from the four distinct phylogenetic clades SAR11, OM43, SAR92, and OM60/OM241 are more similar to cloned sequences from these clades than to those from previously cultured species, with the exception of HTCC168, which is 99.8% similar to the isolate POCPN-5 
ISCUSSION Culturability statistics and detection of growth 
he use of microtiter dishes and a novel technique for making cell arrays enabled us to achieve a higher throughput rate, shorten incubation times, and raise sensitivity for the detection of cells with low growth rates relative to those in previous studies that employed the concept of extinction culturing in natural media 
erguson and colleagues found that the percentage of microbial cells in seawater that could be cultured on a rich nutrient agar medium (MA2216) increased from ⬍0.1% to 13% after 16 h and to 41% after 32 h of confinement in a 4-liter bottle at ambient sample collection temperature (14) 
ur results cannot easily be explained by this “bottle effect,” because (i) the cells were diluted into the 48-well plates between 1 and 4 h after collection from the jetty and within 9 h after collection from the boat; (ii) readily culturable genera, such as Pseudomonas and Vibrio, were rarely detected in our cultures; and (iii) four previously undescribed lineages were grown by our culture method 
irst, bac-  3883  terioplankton cells may be in a dormant state during the winter and either fail to grow or need longer incubation times for growth to be detected 
he seawater medium used for these experiments was collected during the spring and summer months, and our incubation temperature of 16°C is closer to the summer temperature range of 10.0 to 14.7°C versus the winter range of 9.5 to 10.7°C for the 11 samples collected 
uring the winter, the water off the coast is diluted by the Columbia River water plume, mixed by frequent storm events, and not subject to algal blooms 
he bacterioplankton that predominate during the summer may be better adapted to the higher nutrient levels and/or nutrient types provided and therefore more amenable to cultivation by the methods we used 
heoretical estimates of the number of pure cultures expected were consistent with the number and proportion of pure cultures observed by RFLP analysis; 8 of 54 cultures studied in this manner were mixed cultures 
n addition, a dominant cell type may preferentially amplify and thus appears as a pure culture in an RFLP analysis 
hylogenetic identification of the isolates provided striking evidence that extinction culturing in microtiter dishes, with natural seawater and low thresholds of detection, results in the cultivation of microbial groups that appear in environmental clone libraries, but have not been previously detected in culture 
he SAR11 and SAR92 clades, which were isolated in this study (transiently, in the case of SAR11) have previously been detected only by environmental rRNA gene cloning. rRNA gene sequences from isolates of other previously uncultivated clades, OM43 and OM60/OM241 (strains POCPN-5 and KI89C, respectively), were recently deposited in GenBank by other investigators

OCPN-5 is a cultured strain, not a clone.  OM43 clade is a sister clade to a group of marine methylotrophs that includes Methylophilus and Methylobacillus and is commonly found in clone libraries from coastal sites, but not the open ocean (28) 
ethylophilus and Methylobacillus are classified as type I methylotrophs, which use the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway for carbon assimilation 
he OM60/OM241 clades are frequently found in coastal marine clone libraries, and the SAR92 clade is found in open ocean as well as coastal clone libraries 
everal other major uncultured groups that are thought to be abundant in surface seawater, such as the SAR86 and SAR116 clusters, did not appear among the HTCC isolates 
urther innovations in the HTC approach will be needed to close the gap between culture collections and the microbial species dominating marine bacterioplankton communities 
ncubation of extinction cultures under various conditions, including different sources of carbon, light, and other matrices of variables, may lead to the culturing of microorganisms that have specialized growth requirements 
ork in progress has partially achieved these goals through the application of automation tools, such as robotic liquid handling and the automated scanning of cell arrays (J.-C 
appé, and S 
iovannoni, unpublished results).  Culturing organisms remains an important step in the process of understanding the biology and ecology of microbial species 
ultures can be used to obtain complete genome sequences and to identify properties of organisms that could not be identified by genome sequence alone 
or example, cultures of key heterotrophic bacterioplankton may enable oceanographers to study how nutrient limitation and other oceanographically relevant variables affect the growth of individual species and thereby help identify the role dominant species play in geochemical cycles

n an effort to culture the uncultured phylotypes from oligotrophic marine ecosystems, we developed high-throughput culturing procedures that utilize the concept of extinction culturing to isolate cultures in small volumes of low-nutrient media 
pproximately 2,500 extinction cultures from 11 separate samplings of marine bacterioplankton were screened over the course of 3 years 
p to 14% of the cells collected from coastal seawater were cultured by this method, which was 14- to 1,400-fold higher than the numbers obtained by traditional microbiological culturing techniques 
mong the microorganisms cultured were four unique cell lineages that belong to previously uncultured or undescribed marine Proteobacteria clades known from environmental gene cloning studies 
his method proved successful for the cultivation of previously uncultured marine bacterioplankton that have consistently been found in marine clone libraries 
or example, species that would otherwise be “culturable” may fail to grow because their growth state in nature, such as dormancy, prevents adjustment to conditions found in the medium used for the plate counts (13) 
nother explanation for the “great plate count anomaly” is that many of the microbial species that dominate in natural settings are not adapted for growth in media containing high concentrations of complex organic carbon 
he goal of this study was to develop high-throughput culturing (HTC) methods that would enable a large number of extinction cultures to be identified so that the efficacy of this approach could be assessed with a larger sampling of isolates 
light variations of the method were performed during the development of these HTC techniques over the course of 3 years, but the overall approach remained constant

efore each use, the liquid media were checked for sterility by directly counting cells stained with 4⬘,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) as described by Turley (36), except that 1% formaldehyde was used 
o determine the bacterioplankton cell densities of the inocula, direct cell  HIGH-THROUGHPUT CULTURING  3879  counts were done by DAPI staining, where at least 300 cells were counted per filter on triplicate filters 
wo hundred microliters from each well in the plate was filtered into the corresponding chamber of a 48-array filter manifold of custom design manufactured by HyTek Plastics, Corvallis, Oreg 
he diameter of each sector of the array was 2 mm, which enabled the detection of a culture with a cell titer as low as 1.3 ⫻ 103 cells/ml when 200 ␮l of sample was filtered 
ome samples were also treated with 150 ␮l of GES lysis buffer (5 M guanidine thiocyanate, 100 mM EDTA, 0.5% Sarkosyl) while in the concentrator 
he final volumes of the concentrated samples ranged from 10 to 30 ␮l 
he PCR cocktail was treated with UV irradiation to reduce the contamination levels present in the reagents (6, 24) 
he second PCR primer set had at least one primer that amplified from a position internal to the set of primers used in the first PCR 
he concentration of the positive control DNA was measured in a Shimadzu UV160U spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) 
TCC isolates were determined to be a mix of more than one species if RFLP bands from each digest added up to two or more times the length of the expected PCR product 
efore sequencing, the PCR products were purified with the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) 
he concentration of the purified product was measured in a Shimadzu UV160U or BioSpec-1601 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) 
hort sequences of HTCC isolates were added to the tree by using the parsimony insertion tool in ARB 
he percent similarity of sequences was determined with the distance matrix tool in ARB; ambiguous bases were not included 
owever, isolates from three of the four significant phylogenetic clades in this study, HTCC202 (OM43 clade),  TABLE 2 
he sequences of the HTCC isolates used in the phylogenetic analyses have been deposited in GenBank under accession no 
 culturability range of 0.4 to 14.3% was calculated for the different sample collections (Table 1) 
he cell densities of the HTCC cultures ranged from 1.3 ⫻ 103 to 1.6 ⫻ 106 cells per  VOL. 68, 2002  HIGH-THROUGHPUT CULTURING  3881  HTCC175 were short rods (ca. 0.8 to 0.5 ␮m by 0.5 ␮m) 
hese measurements are subject to sizeable error, since these small cells are at or approach the resolution of visible light microscopes 
he failure of two cultures to amplify is probably attributable to problems with the DNA extractions and/or low cell densities in the cultures 
he theoretical statistical estimation for the number of pure cultures versus mixed cultures that should be acquired was consistent with the RFLP analysis (Table 3) 
f the 47 identified cultures, 4 were ␣-Proteobacteria (Fig. 3C) 
ix isolates were members of the phylum Bacteroidetes 
he 16S rRNA sequence for the SAR92 clone (M63811) was  FIG. 2 
luorescence microscopy images of several of the novel isolates 
his range of cell densities is the result of as few as 10.0 to as many as 23.3 doublings during the 3-week incubation period, assuming only one cell from the initial inoculum grew in the well (Table 2) 
he maximum cell concentration attained (1.6 ⫻ 106 cells/ml) is similar to the natural bacterial numbers in seawater, which ranged from 8.1 ⫻ 105 to 5.6 ⫻ 106 cells per ml for the 11 inoculum samples collected 
maging of the DAPI-stained isolates revealed unicellular organisms that were generally of small size 
rom sequence positions 1 to 944, SAR92 is a member of the ␥-Proteobacteria; from positions 1120 to 1354, it is a member of the ␣-Proteobacteria 
he identity of the sequence from 945 to 1119 is ambiguous 
he ␥ portion of the SAR92 clone sequence represents a previously uncultured phylogenetic clade, we have termed the SAR92 clade 
ercent similarities of the sequenced HTCC cultures from the four previously uncultured or undescribed phylogenetic clades were determined, in which several of the sequences were close matches to clones in GenBank (Table 4) (2, 5, 33) 
he goal of this study was to evaluate a culturing format for the highthroughput isolation of uncultured strains of bacterioplankton that are commonly found in gene clone libraries from marine environments 
he percentage of cells that could be cultured by the HTC approach was several orders of magnitude higher than that obtained by culturing on agar plates 
ulturability was observed to be higher in the summer months (8.8%) than in the winter months (1.2%) 
lternatively, the predominant strains or species of cells present in the winter could be organisms that are unable to grow under the laboratory conditions we provided, which were more similar to summer environmental conditions 
lso, the summer months off the coast of Oregon are dominated by upwelling events that bring cool nutrient-rich water to the surface, which subsequently induces large algal blooms 
ased on RFLP analysis, the majority of the cultures identified were pure cultures 
his would indicate that most cultures were the result of only one of the inoculated cells growing in the well 
owever, RFLP analysis would miss mixed cultures with differential cell lysis or where the primers used for PCR amplification fail to amplify all cell types in a culture 
ome of the isolates that were cultured belong to phylogenetic clades that are highly abundant in marine clone libraries 
lones in the SAR11 clade are abundant in clone libraries made from surface marine waters around the world (17) 
hort sequences (approximately 600 bp) of HTCC isolates were added to the trees by using the parsimony insertion tool in ARB 
n parentheses next to HTCC isolates is the number of total cultures from the subset of 47 identified cultures that are included in that clade

he approach we describe can be used to target specific bacterial groups for cultivation by screening cultures for the microorganisms of interest by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization, so that uncultured targets can be sought in a deliberate manner 
o examine arrays of variables, it would be necessary to increase the rate at which cultures are examined 
ombined with proteomics or microarrays, cultures of environmentally significant organisms can be used to examine the adaptations of organisms to environmental change

he presence of two potential BLUF blue light using flavin adenine dinucleotide sensors one of which was found adjacent to the photosynthesis operon in the genome , indicates a light- and redox-dependent regulation of gene expression

n R. sphaeroides the same enzyme complex was shown to be involved in the signal transduction and functions as a redox sensor 24 ( SI Table 2 , which might be also the case in KT71 
ubstrate utilization tests indicate that KT71 prefers complex substrate mixture for growth e.g. yeast extract or Trypticase peptone , whereas many monomeric substrates given as sole source of carbon and energy are used a little or not at all 
s an exception KT71 can grow well with carbon sources such as glutamate pyruvate and fatty acids most likely due to the fact they play central roles in the metabolism of this organism 
lutamate is a central metabolite and is presumably taken up by a proton/ sodium-glutamate symport protein KT71㛭01885 
his pathway plays a central role in the anabolism of nucleotides and amino acids as well as the generation of reducing power by NADPH synthesis 
aboratory experiments have shown that KT71 is not able to use glucose as sole source of carbon and energy

t came as a surprise that KT71 avoids sites with oxygen saturation and grows optimally under microaerobic conditions 
n coastal areas suboxic conditions are found temporarily in large macroscopic aggregates 36 , and permanently a few millimeters below the sediment surface 37 
herefore we hypothesize that the habitat range of KT71 includes particles and sediment surfaces 
hereby in temperate coastal systems like the German Bight marine microorganisms are faced with pronounced fluctuations of multiple parameters such as substrate nutrient and oxygen concentrations as well as light levels on a daily and seasonal scale 
ased on our genomic and ecophysiological data KT71 seems well adapted to such a dynamic shallow shelf environment

T71 most likely uses the APS/PAPS pathway to obtain reduced sulfur compounds 
his cluster contains the core gene set soxXYZAB which is found in many species capable of oxidizing reduced sulfur compounds 29 
nlike in Silicibacter pomeryoi 30 , the supplementation of media with the inorganic sulfur compounds thiosulfate or sulfur did not significantly promote growth of KT71 in cultivation experiments using different carbon sources 
he inability to gain additional energy by the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds may be due to the lack of several sox genes compared with the exemplary cluster of sox genes found in the genome of Paracoccus pantotrophus or S. pomeroyi 30 
f special interest is the lack of the gene soxV that codes in P. pantotrophus GB17 for a membrane protein that is predicted to transfer electrons from the cytoplasma to the periplasmic thioredoxin soxW 31 
espite this finding the possibility exists that KT71 can use alternative sulfur compounds like dimethylsulfoniopropionate or dimethylsulfide that were not tested yet 
. litoralis A Typical Shelf Bacterium KT71 was isolated from coastal surface water in the rather shallow German Bight 
here the water column is close to oxygen saturation during most of the year 
hallow shelf areas are characterized by extensive mixing of the water sediment interface by tides or wind stress 
esuspension of sediment particles into the water column is followed by periods of sedimentation 
rganic particles are nutrient-rich hotspots in the otherwise oligotrophic water column 38 
he possibility that KT71 is actively shaping its environment by facilitating the formation of ‘ ‘ marine snow ’ ’ by polysaccharide production needs to be addressed in future studies 
article association also serves as a transport mechanism to the sediment surface 
here KT71 may thrive on low-molecular-weight substrates like peptides or lipids that accumulate on the sea floor 41 
he presence of a complete mercury-resistance operon KT71㛭16196–16226 in the genome of KT71 is consistent with a prevalence of this strain in the suboxic zone of sediments 
t has been estimated that AAnPs account for ⱖ10 % of the bacterioplankton community in the oligotrophic open ocean 45–47 
urrently the alphaproteobacterial Roseobacter clade is considered to be the dominant group of marine AAnPs 35 51 52

specific highlight of KT71 is the presence of a PS superoperon 
y the light-driven generation of a proton gradient KT71 might be able to survive extended periods of starvation e.g. during the winter period 
ecause a major function of carotenoids is the protection of cells from damage by UV radiation this may reflect an adaptation to low-light zones i.e. depths of several meters in the water column or subsurface sediment layers in shallow water 
ecently strongly pigmented strains closely related to KT71 were isolated from surface sediments in the Wadden Sea suggesting the ability of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade to adapt also to high light conditions J 
hese strains will also allow us to determine whether PS is a general feature of the NOR5/OM60 clade . Jakob Pernthaler initially suggested sequencing KT71 in the framework of the Marine Microbiology Sequencing Initiative of the GBMF

ike other aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs AAnPs , KT71 is able to grow neither anaerobically nor photoautotrophically 
his article is a PNAS direct submission 
hysiological tests indicated that KT71 is not able to grow autotrophically 
T71 is a strictly aerobic organism with a clear preference for low-oxygen niches 
t is becoming more clear that photoheterotrophy is widespread among marine microorganisms 17 44 
redicted protein-coding genes were functionally classified according to COG Ver . 3 67 ( see SI Text

lthough proteases can have a high specificity for distinct substrates this finding points to a preferred utilization of oligopeptides or partly degraded proteins by KT71

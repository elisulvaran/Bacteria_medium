ithin this group a close relationship between aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophs and non-phototrophic members has been found 
wo of the novel isolates Rap1red and Ivo14T were chosen for an analysis in detail 
train Rap1red shared a 16S rRNA sequence identity of 99 % with the type strain of Congregibacter litoralis and was genome-sequenced to reveal the extent of genetic microheterogeneity among closely related strains within this clade 
train Ivo14T was characterized using a polyphasic approach and compared with other red-pigmented members of the OM60/NOR5 clade including Congregibacter litoralis DSM 17192T Haliea rubra DSM 19751T and Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T

MC Microbiology 2013 13:118 http //www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118 Page 2 of 21 Continued from previous page Conclusions Comparative sequence analyses of the pufLM genes of genome-sequenced representatives of the OM60/NOR5 clade indicated that the photosynthetic apparatus of these species was derived from a common ancestor and not acquired by multiple horizontal gene transfer from phylogenetically distant species 
n affiliation of the characterized bacteriochlorophyll a-containing strains to different genera was indicated by significant phenotypic differences and pufLM nucleotide sequence identity values below 82 % 
he revealed high genotypic and phenotypic diversity of closely related strains within this phylogenetic group reflects a rapid evolution and frequent niche separation in the OM60/NOR5 clade which is possibly driven by the necessities of an adaptation to oligotrophic marine habitats 
eywords Phylogeny Aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotroph Proteorhodopsin Mixotroph Picoplankton Coastal marine environment Background Aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic bacteria use light as additional energy source for mixotrophic growth and play a significant role in the microbial ecology of marine environments 1,2 
few years later the two marine isolates HTCC2080 and KT71T were independently identified as aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic gammaproteobacteria by proteomic analyses 6 and genome sequencing 7 , respectively 
train KT71T was subsequently characterized in detail and described as Congregibacter litoralis C. litoralis by Spring et al . 8 , thereby representing the first photoheterotrophic bacterium of this group with a validly published name 
his sequence cluster was recognized as a distinct lineage within the class Gammaproteobacteria and designated as OM60 9,10 or NOR5 clade 11 
ased on these findings it is assumed that the OM60/NOR5 clade of Gammaproteobacteria is of significant ecological importance due to its widespread occurrence in the euphotic zone of saline ecosystems and high abundance especially in coastal waters 6,13,14 
phylogenetic lineage closely related to the OM60/NOR5 cluster was originally defined by a 16S rRNA gene sequence retrieved from deep sea sediment and designated BD1-7 13 
he recently described non-pigmented species Dasania marina 21 and “ Oceanicoccus sagamiensis ” 22 are most likely affiliated to the BD1-7 lineage whereas representatives of the more distantly related genera Spongiibacter 23 and Zhongshania 24 form a third phylogenetic branch 
n this study a comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic characterization of the novel isolate Ivo14T was performed that allowed a detailed comparison to other bacteriochlorophyll BChl a-containing members of the OM60/NOR5 clade so that a profound knowledge of the metabolic plasticity and taxonomic relationships encountered in this ecologically important group of marine gammaproteobacteria could be obtained . Results and discussion Isolation and identification of mixotrophic representatives of the OM60/NOR5 clade An isolation strategy originally designed for the retrieval of strains belonging to the genus Rhodopirellula within the Planctomycetales resulted in the isolation of numerous representatives of the OM60/NOR5 clade of marine gammaproteobacteria 13,25 
he isolation strategy included the use of antibiotics and a screening of redpigmented strains so that all retrieved OM60/NOR5 isolates were pigmented 
trains belonging to this phylogenetic group represented about 10 % of all redpigmented colonies and could be affiliated either to the NOR5-3 or NOR5-1 lineage within this clade based on analyses of their 16S rRNA gene sequences 13 
trains belonging to the OM60/NOR5 clade were further examined for the presence of pufL and pufM genes encoding proteins of the photosynthetic reaction center 
robably the strategy of Winkelmann and Harder 25 was such an effective method for the isolation of mixotrophic members of the OM60/NOR5 clade because it selected for pigmented and slowly growing bacteria adapted to oligotrophic habitats 
wo of the isolated strains Rap1red = NOR5-3 and Ivo14T = NOR5-1BT , representing two different lineages of the OM60/NOR5 clade were selected for a further analysis using genome sequencing 
train Ivo14T representing the highly diverse and environmentally important NOR5-1 lineage was chosen for an additional detailed phenotypic characterization 
n fact photosynthetic pigments could be extracted from cells of H. rubra which showed a pinkish to red pigmentation upon growth in SYPHC medium whereas no pigments could be extracted from the cream-colored cells of H. mediterranea and H. salexigens 
n addition primers for the detection of soxB representative for a periplasmic enzyme complex oxidizing thiosulfate and pop gene encoding the opsin subunit of proteorhodopsin were used to identify alternative potential mixotrophic pathways in described chemoheterotrophic species of the OM60/NOR5 clade and neighboring phylogenetic groups 
esults obtained with the pufLM and soxB primers are depicted in the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1 
t turned out that the genomic DNA of all species described as non-pigmented H. salexigens H. mediterranea “ Oceanicoccus sagamiensis ” Dasania marina Spongiibacter tropicus and Spongiibacter marinus was negative in the amplification of pufLM genes whereas a PCR product of the correct size was obtained from all strains supposed to encode genes for a photosynthetic apparatus except H. rubra 
pplication of the latter primer set allowed the amplification of the pufLM genes of Rap1red and all other available photoheterotrophic members of the OM60/ NOR5 clade but not from H. rubra and species described as non-pigmented 
t turned out that at least two mismatches at the binding site of the forward primer prevented a successful amplification of the pufL and pufM genes from this species 
owever a proteorhodopsin-positive control strain belonging to this phylogenetic group was not available and the pop gene sequence of strain IMCC3088 revealed some mismatches to the used proteorhodopsin oligonucleotide primers 
henotypic characterization Morphology of cells and colonies Size and shape of cells of the newly isolated strain Ivo14T were determined upon growth in SYPHC medium which was optimal for cultivation of this strain and the related species C. litoralis H. rubra and Chromatocurvus halotolerans 
ells of Ivo14T were non motile and appeared coccoid or as short straight-to-bent rods 
ccurrence of pleomorphic cells was observed in all four BChl a-containing strains and depended to some extent on the composition of the growth medium which makes it important to use the same medium for comparison of size and shape 
specially growth on the nutrient-rich medium Marine Broth 2216 led in cultures of H. rubra C. litoralis and Chromatocurvus halotolerans to cells with irregular shapes swelling of cells and accumulation of highly refractile storage compounds whereas these effects were less pronounced in cultures of Ivo14T 
he dendrogram was reconstructed with a neighbor-joining distance matrix program as implemented in the ARB package using phylogenetic distances calculated with the algorithm of Jukes and Cantor 
n addition trees were reconstructed using the PHYLIP maximum parsimony program of ARB and the RAxML maximum likelihood program 
rom left to right the numbers indicate results of the neighbor-joining maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses 
trains that were tested with specific PCR primers for the presence of pufLM and soxB genes are labeled with red and yellow circles respectively 
losed circles indicate a positive PCR reaction and open circles a negative reaction 
nder conditions of carbon starvation cells of C. litoralis had a strong tendency to aggregate and to form flocs in liquid medium 
loc formation in this strain is promoted probably by the production and excretion of pili which can be recognized as meshwork between cells in transmission electron micrographs of cell aggregates Lünsdorf H. personal communication 
he formation of flocs was also regularly observed in H. rubra under conditions of nutrient deprivation and occasionally in Chromatocurvus halotolerans but totally absent in Ivo14T 
olonies of Ivo14T appeared on Marine Agar 2216 after an incubation time of approx . 7 days at 28°C and were dark red round concave smooth and reached a diameter of 1 mm 
n contrast colonies of C. litoralis and Chromatocurvus halotolerans reached a diameter of approx . 2 mm and appeared already after 3 days 
diffusible brownish pigment produced by strain Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T was not observed in the strains Ivo14T H. rubra DSM 19751T and C. litoralis DSM 17192T 
hotosynthetic apparatus and cytochrome composition In vivo absorption spectra of pigmented cells of strain Ivo14T revealed near-infrared peaks at 801 and 871 nm indicating presence of a reaction center embedded in a light-harvesting complex 1 LH1 
he near-infrared band of the BChl a incorporated in the LH1 complex of Ivo14T was significantly blue–shifted compared to the related species Chromatocurvus halotolerans and C. litoralis which displayed peaks at 877 and 876 nm in the respective spectra

imilar results were obtained for Chromatocurvus halotolerans 31 and H. rubra DSM 19751T Figure 2B 
he dominant cytochrome types in pigmented cells of the strains Ivo14T Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T and H. rubra DSM 19751T grown under fully aerobic conditions were determined by redox difference spectroscopy of extracts from whole cells solubilized with the detergent N N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide LDAO 
n dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized redox difference spectra a Soret peak at 421-422 nm and an alpha peak at 553-554 nm indicates that c-type cytochromes were dominating 
dditional b-type cytochromes could be identified by a shoulder of the Soret band around 434 nm in spectra of cell-free extracts of strain Ivo14T and Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T whereas a shoulder around 445 nm suggests the presence of cytochromes containing heme a in Ivo14T and H. rubra DSM 19751T 
rowth characteristics Growth of strain Ivo14T was observed in the range of pH 7.0 to 9.0 and 12 to 32°C with an optimum at pH 8.0 and 28°C 
hese values were quite similar to that of C. litoralis and H. rubra but clearly distinct to Chromatocurvus halotolerans Table 1 , which has a higher temperature optimum and is more halotolerant probably due to the adaptation to growth conditions within the microbial Spring et al 
MC Microbiology 2013 13:118 http //www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118 Page 7 of 21 Table 1 Distinguishing features of characterized BChl a-containing members of the OM60/NOR5 clade Continued L-serine + + -* L-proline + + L-isoleucine + + L-arginine + L-phenylalanine + - L-glutamate - + + + -* L-glutathione - + + + All strains were positive in the utilization of acetate L-alanine fumarate DL-3-hydroxybutyrate DL-malate oxaloacetate pyruvate succinate and L-threonine 
he following compounds were not utilized by all tested strains citrate ethanol formate D-fructose D-glucose glycolate and methanol 
nder optimal growth conditions in SYPHC medium the generation time of strain Ivo14T was 13 h and thus quite long compared to the related type strains of Chromatocurvus halotolerans C. litoralis and H. rubra which have mean doubling times of 8.7 4.5 and 3.4 h respectively 
n subsequent experiments a combination of Lhistidine and L-cysteine each in a concentration of 250 μM was shown to be optimal for growth and expression of photosynthetic pigments in strain Ivo14T 
here was no difference in the requirement of vitamins among the four related BChl a-containing strains which all needed biotin thiamine and B-12 
n contrast to C. litoralis strain Ivo14T was resistant to cefalotin but sensitive to bacitracin and doxycycline 
. rubra and Chromatocurvus halotolerans could be distinguished from the former two strains by their resistance to imipenem 
. rubra was clearly distinct to all strains because it was only sensitive to chloramphenicol bacitracin and gentamicin in the applied disk diffusion test encompassing a total of 13 different antibiotics 
ubstrate utilization pattern and enzyme activities The utilization of carbon sources and enzyme activities were determined for the novel strain Ivo14T and type strains of the related pigmented species Chromatocurvus halotolerans and H. rubra 
he three strains of BChl acontaining aerobic gammaproteobacteria analyzed in this study and C. litoralis were markedly different in their substrate utilization patterns thus enabling their differentiation see Table 1 and the species descriptions below 
istinguishing characteristics of Ivo14T were the utilization of L-phenylalanine as sole carbon source whereas L-glutamate and glutathione could not be used 
n the other hand Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T was unique in the inability to use 2-oxoglutarate and butanol whereas H. rubra DSM 19751T was the only strain expressing the enzyme aesculinase β-glucosidase 
ased on the comparison of substrate utilization patterns it appears that C. litoralis is the metabolic most versatile species being able to utilize a variety of sugars carboxylic acids and alcohols probably reflecting frequent changes of the encountered environmental conditions 
he substrates citrate glucose and lactose could not be utilized although reported as positive whereas the substrates acetate alanine glutamate glycerol lactate propionate pyruvate , serine and succinate could be utilized although reported as negative 
oth values are close to the determined DNA G + C content of C. litoralis 57.7 mol % 8 but significantly lower than in Chromatocurvus halotolerans 63 mol % 31 ) and H. rubra 66.1 mol % determined by genome sequence analysis this study ) ) 
he composition in C. litoralis was dominated by phosphatidylglycerol phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified phospholipid 8 
he pattern of Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T was characterized by an aminophospholipid and an unidentified phospolipid in addition to the dominating polar lipids phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine Table 1 so that it could be distinguished from the profiles of Ivo14T , H. rubra and C. litoralis 
owever the profile of Chromatocurvus halotolerans did match the polar lipid patterns of type strains of the chemoheterotrophic species H. salexigens and H. mediterranea that were obtained in this study and differed slightly from results published elsewhere 17,19 
n a previous study it was found that in C. litoralis the position of the double bond in the unsaturated fatty acids 16:1 and 18:1 depends on the oxygen saturation and was shifted from the ω7 to the ω6 position under conditions of oxygen limitation 8 
ence we propose that C. litoralis expresses two distinct desaturases for the fatty acids 16:1 ω7 Δ9 desaturase encoded by the proposed gene KT71_07544 and 18:1 ω7 Δ11 desaturase probably encoded by KT71_03222 , whereas the ω6 unsaturated fatty acids are produced by an oxygen-independent pathway 
similar effect could not be detected in the strains Ivo14T Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T and H. rubra DSM 19751T Additional file 1 
ikewise H. rubra either does not use desaturases for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids or the oxygenindependent de novo synthesis leads to the common 18:1 ω7 and 16:1 ω7 fatty acids 
hylogeny and evolution of the photosynthetic apparatus Based on 16S rRNA gene identity values the newly isolated strain Ivo14T is only distantly related to described type strains of the OM60/NOR5 clade including Halioglobus pacificus S1-27T 94.6 % , H. rubra Page 9 of 21 CM41_15aT 94.6 % , C. litoralis KT71T 94.6 % , H. mediterranea 7SM29T 94.4 % and Chromatocurvus halotolerans EG19T 93.7 % 
n the other hand strain Rap1red shows a close phylogenetic relationship with C. litoralis KT71T 99.0 % and H. rubra CM41_15aT 96.8 % , comprising together the NOR5-3 line of descent 
n reconstructed phylogenetic trees based on almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences the genus Haliea is currently paraphyletic because H. rubra intermixes with representatives of photoheterotrophic species belonging to the genera Chromatocurvus and Congregibacter while it is only distantly related to the type species H. salexigens Figure 1 
he type strains of H. rubra and C. litoralis share a 16S rRNA sequence identity value of 97 % which indicates a close phylogenetic relationship 
n several reconstructed phylogenetic trees Chromatocurvus halotolerans is positioned adjacent to C. litoralis and H. rubra but this affiliation is not supported by significant bootstrap values Figure 1 
n Figure 3A a phylogenetic tree based on pufLM gene sequences belonging to several distinct groups of Gammaproteobacteria Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria is shown 
n this tree sequences of Chromatocurvus halotolerans and all genome-sequenced representatives of the OM60/NOR5 clade form a monophyletic group together with several cloned pufLM gene sequences retrieved from environmental samples thereby indicating that the photosynthetic reaction center genes within this group were derived from a common ancestor 
he topology of pufLM gene sequences within the OM60/NOR5 clade is roughly in accordance with the phylogeny derived from 16S rRNA gene data showing two main branches comprising representatives of the NOR5-1 and NOR5-3 lineages and a third branch represented by Chromatocurvus halotolerans 
his is in contrast to the Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria in which apparently horizontal gene transfer of pufL and pufM genes among phototrophic members has occurred Figure 3A 
he red color indicates representatives of the OM60/NOR5 clade a blue color betaproteobacteria a green color alphaproteobacteria and sequences given in black are affiliated to the order Chromatiales 
he rpoB sequence of Pseudomomas aeruginosa PAO1 GenBank AE004091 was used as an outgroup . subsequent loss of photosynthesis genes or horizontal transfer of photosynthesis genes within the OM60/NOR5 clade is still possible thereby explaining the close relationship of phototrophic and non-phototrophic species within this group 
evertheless our results contradict a previous report postulating a polyphyletic origin of photosynthetic reaction center genes in members of the OM60/NOR5 clade based on results obtained with the strains HTCC2148 and HTCC2246 6 
owever this would be highly unlikely because strain HTCC2246 like most other known members of the OM60/NOR5 clade is a marine bacterium which was isolated from the open sea water and not from soil 
n terms of evolution the acquisition of genes for anoxygenic photosynthesis in aerobic gammaproteobacteria could have occurred in members of the NOR5-3 lineage which still contain genes encoding a peripheral LH2 complex see Tables 1 and 3 and possess Page 11 of 21 an intracytoplasmic membrane system 8 which is typically found in facultative anaerobic photosynthetic purple bacteria but is otherwise quite uncommon in aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic bacteria 4 
ossibly a further adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus to the conditions of aerobic marine environments in members of the NOR5-1 lineage led to a rapid diversification and speciation process in this subclade reflected by a high number of microdiverse 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from marine surface waters 
n evolving specialization to a distinct type of metabolism could be also reflected in the observed reduction of the genome size among photoheterotrophic members of the OM60/ NOR5 clade The genomes of C. litoralis and Rap1red have an estimated size of 4.3 and 4.2 million base pairs Mb whereas in the strains HTCC2080 Ivo14T and Himb55 which all belong to the NOR5-1 lineage considerably smaller genome sizes of 3.6 3.3 and 2.7 Mb respectively , were found

MC Microbiology 2013 13:118 http //www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118 reductive genome evolution in the genera Prochlorococcus and Candidatus Pelagibacter is driven by an adaptation to the oligotrophic growth conditions in open ocean waters 40,41 
ossible reasons could be that they remained either dependent on nutrient-rich sites for successful proliferation or are specialized on recalcitrant carbon sources 42 resulting in a more restricted distribution and lower frequency in sea water 
urthermore it can be concluded that the acquisition of sox thiosulfate oxidation or pop proteorhodopsin genes had not the same effect on the diversification and expansion of the respective strains as the acquisition of photosynthesis genes 
owever it can be assumed that unlike BChl a-dependent photophosphorylation that allows an increase of growth yield by the utilization of light 8,32 light-driven proton pumping by membrane-embedded proteorhodopsin does not have this effect , at least in the marine alpha- and gammaproteobacteria studied so far 43,44 
ccording to the GGDC the estimated DNA-DNA similarity value between the two most closely related strains C. litoralis DSM 17192T and Rap1red was only 19.8 % ± 8.1 % and thus clearly below 70 % which is the widely accepted threshold value for assigning strains to the same species 
lthough the 16S RNA gene identity value between the type strains of C. litoralis and H. rubra is only 97 % it is close to the traditionally used threshold value above which the affiliation of strains to the same species should be tested by DNA-DNA similarity experiments 50 
e determined the level of DNA-DNA relatedness between C. litoralis and H. rubra in a wet lab DNADNA reassociation experiment 
he obtained result was 21.3 % average of two measurements and hence as expected below the threshold value of 70 % 
he 16S rRNA gene identity values observed among cultured members of the OM60/NOR5 clade range from 91 to 99 % with low divergence values between chemoheterotrophic and photoheterotrophic representatives 
reviously sequences of pufL and pufM genes encoding subunits of the photosynthetic reaction center were successfully used to deduce phylogenetic relationships among phototrophic purple sulfur bacteria Chromatiales [ 37 
t was found that a classification to the genus level is possible based on partial nucleotide sequences of pufL and pufM genes 
n that study pufLM nucleotide sequence identity values below 86 % and 81 % correlated with membership to different genera in Chromatiaceae and Ectothiorhodospiraceae respectively 37 
pplying the lower threshold value to the OM60/ NOR5 clade it turns out that only the closely related strains C. litoralis DSM17192T and Rap1red belong to the same genus sharing a pufLM nucleotide sequence identity value of 82.7 % 
he pufLM genes of the two strains H. rubra DSM 19751T GenBank KC253226 and Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T GenBank JX311416 have a sequence identity of 80.7 % but an affiliation of both strains to the same genus would be in contradiction to phenotypic and 16S rRNA sequence data 
mong all other photoheterotrophic representatives of this clade the pufLM sequence identity values are in the range between 69.3 and 76.6 % and hence clearly below the genus level 
or instance the identity level of the pufLM genes of the two strains Ivo14T and HTCC2080 is only 73.6 % despite a close relationship at the 16S rRNA gene sequence level 96.1 % 
t is assumed that the rpoB gene is representative for the total genome and thus can be used for the delineation of species and genera 55 
espite some minor variations depending on the analyzed phylogenetic group the proposed value for the rpoB gene sequence identity level of strains belonging to the same species is above 98 % and for species of a single genus above approx . 85 % 54,56 
ccordingly the rpoB nucleotide sequence identity between the strains C. litoralis DSM 17192T and Rap1red 84.9 % would indicate an affiliation to the same genus whereas all other values determined among genome sequenced members of the OM60/NOR5 clade were below 80 % 72.2-77.8 % , which is in good agreement with conclusions deduced from the pufLM sequence identity values 
urthermore partial rpoB nucleotide sequences of type strains of the species H. salexigens GenBank JX311417 H. mediterranea Page 13 of 21 GenBank KC253225 and Chromatocurvus halotolerans GenBank JX311416 were determined upon retrieval by PCR amplification , while a complete rpoB gene sequence was extracted from the unpublished draft genome of H. rubra DSM 19751T GenBank KC253224 
comparison of the determined sequences with the available rpoB data set revealed that all identity values were below 85 % except between H. rubra and Chromatocurvus halotolerans which share an rpoB gene sequence identity value of 86.5 % 
his value is unusually high compared to an rpoB sequence identity value of 80.1 % between H. rubra and C. litoralis which even share a higher 16S rRNA gene identity of 97.0 % 
phylogenetic diagram based on the partial rpoB nucleotide sequences Figure 3B confirms with high bootstrap support the existence of two main lineages NOR5-1 and NOR5-3 of BChl a-containing strains within the OM60/NOR5 clade 
robably the observed highly divergent pufLM and rpoB nucleotide sequences among closely related members of the OM60/NOR5 clade indicate that the genomes of these bacteria undergo rapid evolution which may not be reflected in corresponding changes of the highly conserved 16S rRNA gene sequences 
ith the exception of C. litoralis DSM 17192T and Ivo14T all other genome sequenced isolates belonging to the OM60/NOR5 and BD1-7 clades have not yet been characterized phenotypically in detail 
herefore we analyzed the available genome data for the presence of genes with a potential taxonomic significance i.e . encoding traits that could be useful for the description of species and genera 
he results of our analyses are shown in Table 3 and it turned out that both strains Rap1red and C. litoralis DSM 17192T can be distinguished from other members of the analyzed phylogenetic group based on traits that are not strain or species specific 
mong members of the OM60/ NOR5 clade genes for urease and cyanophycin synthetase are so far only found in the latter two strains and can therefore be used for the delineation of the genus Congregibacter from other BChl a-containing taxa . Conclusions In summary molecular and phenotypic data support the affiliation of the photoheterotrophic strains Ivo14T Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T H. rubra DSM 19751T and C. litoralis DSM 17192T to different genera within the OM60/NOR5 clade

esults Several strains of aerobic red-pigmented bacteria affiliated to the OM60/NOR5 clade were obtained from tidal flat sediment samples at the island of Sylt North Sea Germany 
n addition a draft genome sequence was obtained from the isolate Ivo14T which belongs to the environmental important NOR5-1 lineage that contains so far no cultured representative with a comprehensive description 
embers of this physiological group belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria have been intensively studied for review see e.g . 3,4 ) but so far little is known on the phenotypic diversity of representatives belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria 
he existence of aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic gammaproteobacteria in marine environments was first postulated in a study by Béjà et al . 5 , who could identify photosynthesis genes in partial genome sequences of gammaproteobacteria retrieved from seawater off the coast of California USA 
hylogenetically C. litoralis is affiliated to a large coherent cluster of 16S rRNA gene sequences which were mainly retrieved by cultivation-independent methods from marine habitats around the world 
n recent years reports about the isolation of additional strains belonging to the OM60/NOR5 group have accumulated 
n contrast no photosynthetic pigments were reported in members of the genus Haliea 17-19 or Halioglobus 20 
oteworthy Haliea rubra H. rubra , which is closely related to C. litoralis was also reported to form redpigmented colonies on Marine Agar 2216 18 , but in the original species description the formation of photosynthetic pigments was not reported 
o exclude the possibility that a phototrophic phenotype has escaped attention in described strains of the genus Haliea type strains belonging to this genus were cultured in SYPHC medium which allowed expression of pigments in all photoheterotrophic strains belonging to the OM60/NOR5 clade tested so far 
Chl acontaining species belonging to the OM60/NOR5 clade were used as positive control 
t should be noted that application of the published primers pufLF1 und pufMR1 5 failed to amplify pufLM genes from strain Rap1red so that we designed the primers pufLF2 und pufMR2 which have a slightly modified Page 3 of 21 sequence optimized for members of the OM60/NOR5 clade 
owever the pufLM nucleotide sequence of H. rubra could be finally obtained by the determination of a draft genome sequence unpublished data 
or the PCR screening with the proteorhodopsin primer set PR13 26 we used genomic DNA from Dokdonia sp 
RO95 27 as well as total DNA isolated from the North Sea as positive control 
hus either the tested strains do not encode pop genes or the genes are such different at the primer binding sites that no PCR amplification was possible 
he intracellular carbon storage compound of H. rubra could be distinguished from cyanophycin or polyhydroxyalkanoates by a positive reaction of the acidified cell extract with the anthrone reagent which detects carbohydrates 
his indicates most likely the presence of glycogen as reserve Spring et al

esignations given in red color indicate that the respective strains produce BChl a and/or encode genes for a photosynthetic apparatus names in blue indicate the presence of proteorhodopsin encoding genes 
he bar represents an estimated sequence divergence of 5 % . polymer because a coherent cluster of glycogen synthesis genes was found in the draft genome sequence of H. rubra DSM 19751T unpublished data 
similar phenomenon was reported previously for the oligotrophic marine alphaproteobacterium Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique 28 
nterestingly the whole-cells spectrum of H. Spring et al 
ells of Luminiphilus syltensis Ivo14T red line were grown in SYMHC medium in the dark under air atmosphere while Pseudohaliea rubra DSM 19751T green line was cultured in SYPHC medium in the light 
he position of distinct peaks of the spectra is indicated 
he observed spectrum indicates the presence of a peripheral LH3 complex accompanied by a small amount of the supposed LH1 complex 
ightharvesting complexes of the LH3 type were first described in the purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodoblastus acidophilus incubated under low-light and/or low temperature conditions 29,30 
o the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a LH3 complex in an obligately aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium 
n contrast to Rhodoblastus acidophilus the LH3 complex in H. rubra was apparently expressed constitutively because its formation was independent of variations in illumination light/darkness or oxygen Page 5 of 21 concentration 6 21 % v/v O2 in the headspace gas atmosphere 
hus the pigment composition of the photosynthetic apparatus in all obligately aerobic gammaproteobacteria studied so far seems to be identical Table 1 
bundance of the LH1 complex in living cells estimated by determination of A870 nm/A660 nm ratios reached maximal values of 0.80 to 0.83 
his expression level of the LH1 complex corresponded to a measured BChl a concentration of around 1.2 nmol/mg cellular dry weight 
further analysis of the cytochrome composition in these strains is given in 32 
he NaCl concentration suitable for growth was 1 9 % w/v , the optimum at 3 % w/v 
ata marked with an asterisk were taken from the literature 18,31 
s a peculiarity the requirements of Ivo14T for growth in defined medium were more complex than that of C. litoralis H. rubra or Chromatocurvus halotolerans 
o growth was detected below 40 μmol/l L-histidine in the medium 
he growth-stimulating effect was not concentration dependent within the tested range of up to 500 μmol/l 
histidine stimulated also the growth of H. rubra in defined media by shortening the observed lag-phase but it was not an essential compound for growth 
owever some variation in the sensitivity to antibiotics was found 
ll four strains were not able to grow under anaerobic or autotrophic conditions in the light thus confirming their definition as aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic gammaproteobacteria 
t has to be noted that the substrate utilization pattern obtained for H. rubra DSM 19751T was significantly Spring et al 
MC Microbiology 2013 13:118 http //www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118 Page 8 of 21 different from the one reported previously 18 
n our hands the BIOLOG assay used by Urios et al . 18 for the physiological characterization of H. rubra was not satisfactory for photoheterotrophic members of the OM60/NOR5 clade because neither H. rubra DSM 19751T nor C. litoralis DSM 17192T or Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T showed a clear response in BIOLOG plates at least after an incubation period of 1 2 weeks 
owever some differences became apparent in the polar lipid pattern 
he same pattern was found in H. rubra DSM 19751T whereas in Ivo14T an unidentified aminophospholipid instead of the phospholipid was detected 
atty acids that were detected only in trace amounts 0.5 % or less of the total amount are not shown 
he position of the double bond in unsaturated fatty acids is located by counting from the methyl Ω end of the carbon chain cis isomers are indicated by the suffix c ISO indicates iso-branched fatty acids 
t is known that several pathways for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids exist in proteobacteria 
owever in this strain the reduced amount of 18:1 ω7 was not compensated by the formation of 18:1 ω6 
he absence of genes encoding putative desaturases in the Ivo14T draft genome suggests that this strain relies completely on an oxygen-independent pathway for the de novo synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids 
hus strains like C. litoralis DSM 17192T or Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T may be better adapted to oxidative stress than Ivo14T which would explain that the negative effect of light on pigment production is most pronounced in strain Ivo14T 32 
n a recent study it was shown that in Dinoroseobacter shibae the repression of pigment synthesis is mainly caused by oxidative stress 36 
herefore Chromatocurvus halotolerans should not be included in the genus Congregibacter or NOR5-3 lineage which is in line with the suggestion made in a previous work 13 
nly the clustering of H. rubra with Chromatocurvus halotolerans in the pufLM based tree represents a discrepancy with the 16S rRNA phylogeny 
owever no indications of a horizontal gene transfer of puf genes from distant phylogenetic lineages to members of the OM60/NOR5 clade were found which is in line with results obtained with representatives of the order Chromatiales a group of purple sulfur bacteria belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria 37 
ne possible explanation for this divergence could be the variable genome structure in some members of the Alphaproteobacteria especially the Roseobacter clade 38

endrogram based on partial rpoB nucleotide sequences of members of the OM60/NOR5 clade 
trains known to produce BChl a are given in red names in blue indicate the presence of proteorhodopsin encoding genes 
n the meanwhile a draft genome sequence of HTCC2148 has been determined 39 , but pufLM gene fragments identified by PCR in a previous report 6 were missing 
MC Microbiology 2013 13:118 http //www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118 sequence of strain HTCC2246 is available but it belongs like HTCC2148 to the NOR5-8 branch within the OM60/ NOR5 clade which does not contain any known phototrophic representatives so far Figure 1 
n addition we found in our analysis a high similarity of the pufLM genes of HTCC2246 with the Bradyrhizobium sp . strain S23321 Figure 3A 
radyrhizobium species are found in the rhizosphere of plants where they form root nodules 
ence the pufLM genes of strain HTCC2246 must have been recently transferred from a nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium forming root-nodules 
onsequently we speculate that the results reported by Cho et al . 6 may have been caused by a contamination of the analyzed samples with cells or DNA of phototrophic alpha- or betaproteobacteria inhabiting freshwater or soil but not marine environments 
robably the optimization of anoxygenic photophosphorylation under aerobic conditions gave representatives of the NOR5-1 lineage a selective advantage which enabled them to play a significant role in the euphotic zone of coastal marine environments 
n the other hand the known closely related nonphototrophic species do not represent large coherent clusters of environmental 16S rRNA gene sequences but rather belong to lineages comprising 16S rRNA gene sequences that are less frequently found in the environment 
he situation for proteorhodopsin is more complicated because no data about the effect of light on the growth response of PRharboring strains belonging to the OM60/NOR5 clade e.g 
ccording to current knowledge proteorhodopsin in marine proteobacteria only helps to survive periods of starvation i.e . in the absence of a suitable carbon source or essential nutrients like iron or phosphorous but does not promote proliferation in cases when the amount of an available carbon source limits growth 28,45 
his could also explain why the proteorhodopsin-containing alphaproteobacterium Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique is dominating in extreme oligotrophic nutrient depleted surface waters in the middle of the oceans 46 , whereas aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic gammaproteobacteria prevail in coastal surface waters 14,47,48 , where in most cases the amount of the carbon source is the growth limiting factor 
taxonomic framework for the OM60/NOR5 clade based on phylogenomic data Delineation of species An established approach for the delineation of species is the comparison of whole genome data for example by calculating the overall similarity using high-scoring segment pairs HSPs 
he HSP method is implemented in Page 12 of 21 the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator GGDC , which infers distances from the comparison of a set of HSPs using three distinct formulas 
he obtained distances can then be transformed to values analogous to experimentally obtained DNA-DNA similarity values which still represent a widely accepted gold standard for the delineation of species in bacterial taxonomy 49 
he low calculated overall genome similarity is in good agreement with the observed high sequence divergence of protein-coding genes which exclude an affiliation of both strains to the same species despite the high 16S rRNA gene identity value of 99 % 
elineation of genera In bacterial taxonomy the definition of genera is more complicated than the classification of species because universal applicable threshold values still do not exist 
n some phylogenetic groups like Mycoplasmatales e.g. [ 51 ) or Spirochaetales e.g. [ 52 ) such values are typically found among members of a single genus which may be due to the restricted number of suitable phenotypic traits available for classification among the members of these phylogenetic groups 
n the other hand in families that are phenotypically well studied like Chromatiaceae e.g. 53 ) or Enterobacteriaceae [ 54 the delineation of genera is often based on 16S rRNA gene divergence values of around 3 % or less 
owever the determined significant phenotypic differences among closely related strains within the OM60/NOR5 clade indicate that comparative 16S rRNA sequence analyses alone do not allow a reliable dissection of taxa in this phylogenetic group 
MC Microbiology 2013 13:118 http //www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118 than the 16S rRNA gene so that a better resolution of closely related species can be obtained 
n addition a comparison of protein-coding genes avoids the bias of arbitrarily selected phenotypic traits often used for the characterization of species 
he high divergence values of the pufLM genes could either indicate a rapid evolution of the photosynthetic apparatus alone or of the total genome 
n order to determine representative levels of genome divergence we have selected the housekeeping gene rpoB encoding the RNA polymerase β-subunit as an additional phylogenetic marker 
he clustering of H. rubra with Chromatocurvus halotolerans confirms the results obtained by comparison of the pufLM genes but is in conflict with the 16S rRNA based phylogenetic tree 
owever distinguishing phenotypic features are still a requirement for the formal description of novel taxa 
n addition the detection of a photosynthetic apparatus in H. rubra suggests its separation from the non-phototrophic genus Spring et al

MC Microbiology 2013 13:118 http //www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118 In brief the OM60/NOR5 isolates were obtained as follows In October 2005 sediment samples were collected from a tidal flat area at Königshafen bay near the town of List on the German Island of Sylt 
ost samples were obtained from the top oxic layer of muddy or sandy intertidal sediments 
total of 240 red-pigmented colonies were obtained of which 22 could be affiliated to the OM60/NOR5 clade by phylogenetic analyses of their partial 16S rRNA gene sequences 
aliea rubra CM41_15aT was deposited in the DSMZ by the Laboratoire Arago Université Pierre et Marie Curie Banyuls-sur-mer France under the conditions of a Material Transfer Agreement 
he authenticity of the used strains has been confirmed by the Identification Service of the DSMZ by sequencing of the respective 16S rRNA genes 
he pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.5 – 7.7 prior to autoclaving 
arious concentrations of oxygen in the headspace gas atmosphere were obtained by filling serum vials with anoxic medium to certain levels as described previously 8

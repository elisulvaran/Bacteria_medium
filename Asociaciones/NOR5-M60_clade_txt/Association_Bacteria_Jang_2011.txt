ccurate whole human genome sequencing using reversible terminator chemistry 
train IMCC3088 could be the first bacterium that harbors proteorhodopsin among the members of the OM60/NOR5 clade, indicating the existence of diverse metabolic potential in the members of this marine clade 
he genome sequence of strain IMCC3088 is available in GenBank under accession number AEIG00000000.  The OM60/NOR5 clade, part of the oligotrophic marine Gammaproteobacteria group, comprises up to 11% of the bacterial communities on the ocean surface (3, 5, 6, 9) 
his important marine clade includes Congregibacter litoralis (6, 7) and extinction cultures designated HTCC2080, HTCC2148, and HTCC2246 (3, 4), in addition to several uncharacterized marine oligotrophic bacteria 
train IMCC3088 was isolated from a surface seawater sample collected from the Yellow Sea off the coast of Incheon, South Korea, by using standard dilution techniques on an oligotrophic medium, marine 1/10R2A 
he strain is also closely related to cultured marine isolates of C. litoralis KT71 (94.8%), Haliea rubra CM4115a (94.7%), and strain HTCC2080 (93.9%)

ethodology/Principal Findings: Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria represent an important part of marine microbial communities 
onclusions/Significance: Our investigations shed light on the evolution and functional implications in PGCs of marine aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs, and support the notion that AAP are a heterogenous physiological group phylogenetically scattered among Proteobacteria 
nterestingly, the  Introduction Aerobic anoxygenic photototrophic (AAP) bacteria represent an important group of marine microorganisms inhabiting the euphotic zone of the ocean 
ultureindependent studies have shown that marine AAP bacterial communities are mostly represented by Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria [4,5] 
ost cultured marine Alphaproteobacterial AAPs belong to Roseobacter clade and the order Sphingomonadales, which includes members of the genera Erythrobacter and Citromicrobium [6–8] 
wo species were members of Gammaproteobacteria: Congregibacter (Cb.) litoralis KT71 [9,10] and marine Gammaproteobacterium HTCC2080 [11] 
ur investigation shed light on the evolution and functional implications of PGCs of marine aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs.  Six strains were used for pigment analyses: Rsb. denitrificans OCh 114 (DSM 7001), Rsb. litoralis Och 149 (DSM 6996) and Erb. longus DSM 6997 were purchased from the DSMZ culture collections

lmost all sequences in the largest subclade NOR5-1 and related subclade NOR5-4 originated from marine surface water samples 
verall, most of the NOR5/OM60 sequences were retrieved from marine coastal settings, whereas there were fewer from open-ocean surface waters, deep-sea sediment, freshwater, saline lakes and soil 
he abundance of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade in various marine sites was determined by ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization using a newly designed and optimized probe set 
elative abundances in coastal marine waters off Namibia and the Yangtze estuary were up to 3% of the total 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) counts, and in the German Bight off Helgoland the abundance was even up to 7% 
n an open-ocean North Atlantic transect, between Iceland and the Azores, the NOR5/OM60 group was much less abundant (0.1–0.5%) 
n analysis of the frequencies of NOR5/OM60 16S rRNA genes in the Global Ocean Survey datasets provided further support for a marine cosmopolitan occurrence of NOR5/OM60, and a clear preference for coastal marine waters. r 2008 Elsevier GmbH

n parallel, HTCC2080, one of three gammaproteobacterial strains obtained by highthroughput cultivation from coastal Paciﬁc surface water off Oregon, was shown to grow faster and to have higher cell yield with light rather than in the dark [12] 
n 1997, two almost fulllength sequences were found to be closely related to SAR125; clones OM60 (U70696) and OM241 (U70702) were from a marine coastal site off North Carolina, USA [51] 
train KT71 was placed in a group named NOR5, and recently the binominal name ‘‘Congregibacter litoralis’’ has been suggested for this isolate [22] 
ased on comparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis, the NOR5/OM60 clade is most closely related to the genera Endobugula, Microbulbifer, Teredinibacter (all Alteromonadales), Cellvibrio (Pseudomonadales) and several other groups of oligotrophic marine Gammaproteobacteria, including the clades BD1-7, KI89A, OM182 and SAR92 [11] 
he probe NOR5-730 has yielded counts in North Sea surface water of up to 8% [19], and even 11% [48] of all DAPI-stained cells 
he goals of this study were to provide a more detailed description of the phylogeny of the  125  NOR5/OM60 clade and to analyze its geographic distribution, as well as abundance, in the marine environment 
his information originated mostly from PCR-based clone libraries, but also encompassed isolates and the metagenomic Global Ocean Survey (GOS) [52] 
ased on this comprehensive dataset the speciﬁcity of published 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes was checked, and new ones were designed 
ith this, the abundance of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade was quantiﬁed in coastal marine sites off China, Namibia, Spain, and Germany, as well as in an open-ocean transect in the North Atlantic.  Materials and methods Sequence retrieval NOR5/OM60-related 16S rRNA sequences were initially retrieved with the ARB program (http:// www.arb-home.de/) [43] from the SILVA database (Version 91) [50] (http://www.arb-silva.de/) by targeting group-speciﬁc signatures (e.g. complement to probe NOR5-730 with 0–2 mismatches) 
ighly related sequences were also identiﬁed using Blastn (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), and imported into the database 
dditionally, the 16S rRNA subset of the Camera GOS Cruise, a metagenomic project that sampled various environments, including pelagic and coastal seawater, fresh water or hypersalinic environments [52], was downloaded (http://web.camera.calit2. net/) and analyzed in a similar way 
equences were manually checked for sequence quality and chimera, using the pintail value [5] provided with the SILVA 16S rRNA gene database and using the program ‘‘chimera check’’ at the website of the ribosomal database project (http://rdp8.cme.msu.edu/cgis/chimera.cgi?su=SSU) [13] 
he sequences were aligned using the ARB aligner, and added to the universal parsimony tree using ‘‘ARB parsimony’’ with a ‘‘positional variability by parsimony’’ ﬁlter for Bacteria [50] 
he 16S rRNA sequences from 22 newly isolated strains from sediment off the North Sea island Sylt (55.011N, 8.261E) were determined by standard molecular techniques (PCR, sequencing) and submitted  ARTICLE IN PRESS 126  S

ubsequently, the trees obtained using the three ﬁltered sets and four methods were compared manually 
hree column ﬁlters were made in ARB and were used for selecting the columns with certain conservative levels for calculation 
ach ﬁlter kept 1493, 1450 and 1393 bases, respectively 
he sequences were ﬁltered into different datasets, and each was then used as input for four different algorithms: ‘‘ARB neighbor joining’’ (Felsenstein correction), ‘‘ARB parsimony interactive’’, Maximum likelihood using AxML, and the posterior possibility algorithm using MrBayes (Version 3.1, http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/) [27] 
hen, the ﬁrst thousand trees of the unstable generations were ‘‘burnt in’’ using ‘‘halfcompat’’, and MrBayes consensus trees were con-  Table 1.  Probe design, check and optimization The ‘‘probe check’’ module in the ARB program was used to check probes NOR5-730 and NOR5-130 [19] for coverage and speciﬁcity, but also to design new probes for NOR5/OM60 subclades 
elper and competitor nucleotides were designed and tested as described before [21,46] (Table 1) 
he probes were optimized by performing hybridization with all the relevant helpers and competitors at varying formamide concentrations [23] 
ptimizations were carried out at 46 1C on pure cultures with a fully complementary 16S rRNA.  Biogeographic analysis For each of the NOR5/OM60 sequences retrieved from the databases, the geographic and environmental data were manually collected, either directly from  Probes, helpers and competitors that were used in this study.

he water samples from Cuxhaven were treated identically but they were not pre-ﬁltered.  North Sea sediment The sediment samples were sampled from a sandy intertidal ﬂat at Janssand (53.721N, 7.681E), German North Sea coast, in March and August 2007 
ach time two adjacent cores were sampled for duplicates, and subsampled for each 1 cm range 
he subsamples were ﬁxed and sonicated, then the supernatant was ﬁltered onto polycarbonate ﬁlters, as described previously [41,49].  Yangtze River estuary  Small sampling campaigns  On September 6–8, 2006, a small cruise was undertaken in the Yangtze River estuary (Fig. 1) 
amples were taken from surface water, and immediately ﬁxed with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h, ﬁltered onto polycarbonate ﬁlters (Millipore, 47 mm in diameter, 0.2 mm pore size) and stored frozen at 20 1C.  A summary of all additional sampling stations is given in Table 2 
urface water samples from Xiamen, China were taken in September 2006 at the Xiamen ferry port, and in July 2007 from a sandy coast near Xiamen University

n contrast to earlier trees based on less sequences [11,22] the current reconstruction of the NOR5/OM60 clade now also includes, besides the sequences from strain KT71 and clones OM60 and OM241, a cluster of freshwater clones and BD2-7, a clone retrieved from the deep sea 
owever, exceptions did occur (e.g. due to imperfect sequence quality) and therefore sequence identity alone was insufﬁcient to include or exclude a new sequence from the NOR5/OM60 clade 
he exact branching within the NOR5/OM60 clade depended on the algorithms and ﬁlters used for reconstruction 
an et al. / Systematic and Applied Microbiology 32 (2009) 124–139  NOR5-12, and showed low identity (usually o92%) with other NOR5/OM60 sequences 
ive more partial sequences retrieved from fresh water studies (EF192914, EF192886, EF192904, AY214643 and AY214720) [18,40] did not group in the NOR5-13 subclade 
bout 30% of NOR5/OM60 sequences could not be grouped into any of the above-mentioned subclades, and most of these were partial sequences 
he representatives of each subclade and closely related outgroups are listed in SI Table 2 as hallmarks for categorizing further sequences 
he largest subclade was labeled as NOR5-1, and it comprised more than one-third of all the available fulllength sequences, as well as many partial sequences 
he largest was NOR5-1A with more than 90 full and partial sequences (50% of NOR5-1) 
OR5-1C also seemed to be monophyletic, which did not apply to the other sequences of NOR5-1 (‘‘NOR5-1B’’), which included strain HTCC2080 and several North Sea strains, such as Ivo14 
ubclades NOR5-2 and NOR5-7 were close to NOR5-3 in most phylogenetic reconstructions 
hey currently comprise only a few sequences, including those of the NEP isolates obtained from Japanese marine coastal sediments [45], and an isolate from coastal marine water sampled off Banyuls-sur-Mer [1,2] 
ubclades NOR5-5, NOR5-6, NOR5-8, NOR5-9 and NOR5-11 together contained one-ﬁfth of all the NOR5/OM60 sequences

he large subclades NOR5-1 and NOR5-4 appeared almost exclusively in the marine water column 
ubclades NOR5-10 and NOR5-12 contained mainly identiﬁcations reported from deep-sea samples, and NOR5-13 was a freshwater clade 
equences of the other NOR5/OM60 subclades were retrieved from marine sediment and the water column 
dentiﬁcations have been reported from almost all oceans and at many coastal sites 
n this respect, the American, European and East Asian coasts are particularly well covered with 16S rRNA gene libraries 
here seems to be no latitudinal preference since NOR5/OM60 clones have been reported from mangrove [38,39] and coral reef [6,20,35], as well as seaice habitats [10] 
OR5/OM60 sequences were also reported in deep-sea sediments sampled near Antarctica [9] and Japan [4,28,37], as well as in the northeast Paciﬁc [26] and the Atlantic (Schauer, unpublished) 
dditional reports on NOR5/OM60 sequences come from environments with different salinity: freshwater rivers [54,57], a rice paddy (DQ830363), freshwater sediments [44,61], activated sludge [32], soil [25,40], and also from  hypersaline environments [24,36,52] 
herein, 28 belonged to subclade NOR5-1, which is typical of marine surface water, and two belonged to its sister subclade NOR5-4

OR5/OM60 16S rRNA sequences were clearly more frequent in coastal (20/1471; 1.4%) than in open-ocean samples (5/1516; 0.3%).  Design and optimization of probes for the quantiﬁcation of the NOR5/OM60 clade Our comprehensive collection of 16S rRNA sequences of the NOR5/OM60 clade facilitated a re-evaluation of oligonucleotide probes targeting this group 
he new probe NOR5-1238 (Table 1) targeted 46% of all high-quality NOR5/OM60 sequences, excluding the two major subclades NOR5-1 and NOR5-4 
 combination of the probes NOR5-730 and NOR5-1238 increased the current coverage of the NOR5/OM60 clade to 92%, without any outgroup hits (Fig. 2) 
he combination failed to detect part of NOR5-1C, NOR5-2, NOR5-10, and all sequences in the NOR5-12 subclade 
he application of two helpers per probe signiﬁcantly increased the intensity of monolabeled and CARD-FISH signals 
ixed cells of Congregibacter litoralis KT71 were used to determine the optimal formamide concentration for hybridization of probes NOR5-730 and NOR-1238 as 50% 
hese two probes were subsequently used at this formamide concentration in combination with helpers NOR5-659h, NOR5-709h, NOR5-1217h and NOR51287h for a speciﬁc and sensitive identiﬁcation of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade in environmental samples.  Quantiﬁcation of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade by CARD-FISH The cells detected by CARD-FISH with the probe mixture NOR5-730/NOR5-1238 in marine plankton and benthos samples were pleomorphic (Fig. 4), often from coccoid to rod-shaped, sometimes were also bent  in a vibrio shape 
he length of the cells was between 0.5 and 3 mm, with a diameter between 0.5 and 1 mm 
n the brackish to marine Yangtze River estuary (salinities of 22–32 psu), between 0% and 2.3% of all DAPI-stained cells were detected 
ounts in surface waters obtained during an openocean North Atlantic transect in September 2006 (Vision cruise) were between 0.1% and 0.5% (3  103–1  104 cells ml1) 
hree depth proﬁles made at coastal (14.361E), mid-shelf (13.151E) and open-ocean stations (12.001E) all clearly showed a steep decrease of the NOR5/OM60 abundances with depth 
elow 70 m, the counts became marginal (o0.05%), and NOR5/OM60 cells were not detected below 300 m 
t this sample point, a range of 2.5–4.0% was detected in the top 3 cm of the sediment, and 1.4–3.1% at a depth of 3–12 cm (Fig. 6)

he two fully sequenced strains of the NOR5/OM60 clade, ‘‘Congregibacter litoralis’’ KT71 and HTCC2080 contain two and one ribosomal operon, respectively 
hen the copy number of the NOR5/OM60 group members is less than the average, the frequency of 16S rRNA genes in the metagenomic library might underestimate the relative abundance of cells, and vice versa 
n fosmid libraries constructed from bacterioplankton samples at Aloha Station, Hawaii, 16S rRNA genes of the NOR5/OM60 clade were detected at depths of 10 m and 70 m, but not at 130 m or deeper [17] 
n our study, the samples from Xiamen, Barcelona and Helgoland showed the same trend, with high counts of NOR5/OM60 co-occurring with algal blooms 
e hope that the more sensitive and speciﬁc probes and protocols developed in this study will facilitate more detailed investigations on the seasonality of NOR5/ OM60 abundance in the future 
esides season, water depth, and distance to the coast, we also searched for other parameters that might inﬂuence the distribution of NOR5/OM60 in the water column 
onsequently, linear regression analysis was used to check for correlation between NOR5/OM60 abundance and other parameters 
ndeed, the cultured strain KT71 prefers short oligomers and amino acids as substrates [22], which are generally rapidly consumed in the water column [63] 
an et al. / Systematic and Applied Microbiology 32 (2009) 124–139  plankton cell counts at either site 
he NOR5/OM60 group and the AAnPs showed some common features for distribution, at least in some regions: they both occurred at a higher percentage in coastal water compared to the open ocean, and they were more abundant in summer or autumn than in winter or spring 
ost of them appear in the euphotic zone in the marine water column and they are positively related to high chlorophyll concentrations [15,30,53,56,62] 
owever, considering the rather high 16S rRNA sequence diversity within the NOR5/OM60 clade and its broad habitat range, it cannot be taken for granted that all members of NOR5/OM60 are AAnPs 
he four strains isolated from marine surface waters KT71 (NOR5-3), HTCC2080 (NOR5-1B), HTCC2246 (not grouped) and HTCC2148 (NOR5-8) were shown to contain genes pufL and pufM coding for light-harvesting complex I (LHC I) 
owever, pufL and pufM trees lacked congruence with the 16S rRNA phylogeny [12] 
he pufM gene of HTCC2080 belongs to pufM Group K, the sister group of KT71, while the pufL and pufM genes of the HTCC2246 and HTCC2148 groups belong to different clusters of Alphaproteobacteria [62] 
his suggests that the loss and gain of photosynthesis operons might be quite frequent in the NOR5/OM60 clade 
n this respect, Yutin and colleagues [62] have recently reported on compositional changes within the AAnP between coastal and open-ocean sites 
nly six out of 85 scaffolds identiﬁed to include pufM in the oxic samples of the GOS dataset were highly similar to the pufM of Congregibacter litoralis KT71 and therefore likely to be from the NOR5/OM60 clade 
hese were from coastal samples, whereas the pufM of the alphaproteobacterial Roseobacter-type was found throughout the samples, and, additionally, as yet unidentiﬁed groups of AAnP seemed to dominate pelagic marine waters [62].

nterestingly, the surface layer of North Sea intertidal sediments was very rich in NOR5/OM60, with absolute numbers 4108 cells cm3 (or 4% of the total DAPI) 
hey also seem to be highly abundant in the oceans 
ecent studies based on infrared microscopy showed abundances of 4.572.4% with a maximum of 13.5% in coastal waters, while in oceanic water the frequency was lower at 1.571.3% [30,56,62] 
his recently changed when genome analyses of marine gammaproteobacterial isolates revealed the presence of complete photosynthesis superoperons [22] 
he North Sea isolate KT71 was identiﬁed as AAnP based on the expression of photosynthetic pigments [22] 
n 1999, strain KT71 (AY007676) was isolated from marine surface water at the ‘‘Kabeltonne’’ station off the island of Helgoland, North Sea [19] 
everal related strains isolated by a novel high-throughput culturing method, including HTCC2080, were placed in the OM60/OM241 clade [14], which was later referred to as the OM60 clade [11] 
ince all these clade names are now largely redundant, we refer to it here as the NOR5/OM60 clade [22] and, currently, many more related sequences can be found in various databases 
 sequence retrieved from deep-sea sediment, BD2-7 (AB015537) [37], was considered to represent a sister clade to the NOR5/OM60 clade 
ata on the biogeography of the NOR5/OM60 clade are so far sparse 
esides the mostly qualitative evidence from sequence retrieval there is also some quantiﬁcation by ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) 
ith the same probe, an abundance of 3.471.1% was detected in a Paciﬁc coastal transect along the Newport Hydroline [12], where maximum numbers of up to 1  105 cells ml1 were linked to the chlorophyll maximum

he NOR5/OM60 clade is cosmopolitan in the marine realm 
nlike the alphaproteobacterial RCA-1 cluster [55], it was still not possible in this study to detect biogeographic patterns for the various NOR5/OM60 subclades, neither latitudinal nor with respect to certain oceanic provinces.  NOR5/OM60 afﬁliated 16S rRNA genes in the GOS metagenomics dataset The GOS dataset [52] contains 3728 16S rRNA gene sequences with lengths 4300 nt 
y comparative sequence analysis, 30 of these sequences (0.8%) could be unambiguously grouped within the NOR5/OM60 clade 
xcept for station GS-04 (Atlantic, Canadian coast, salinity 28.3 psu), in which four out of a total of 31 16S rRNA gene sequences afﬁliated with the NOR5/OM60 clade, all the other libraries contained at most two NOR5/ OM60 sequences 
robe NOR5-730 (Table 1) has been used in several studies for FISH-based quantiﬁcation of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade [19] 
his probe covered 131 out of 155 (84%) high-quality, almost full-length 16S rRNA sequences of the NOR5/OM60 clade included in the SILVA Ref dataset (Version 91) [50] 
he probe design function of ARB [43] was used in an attempt to design new probes with an improved coverage of the NOR5/OM50 clade 
owever, it was not possible to design a single probe that perfectly matched all the NOR5/OM60 sequences without targeting outgroup sequences 
elper oligonucleotides were designed for all the above probes in an attempt to improve their hybridization efﬁciency (Table 1) [21] 
elpers are unlabeled oligonucleotides that bind in the vicinity of the probe, thereby presumably opening the secondary structure of the rRNA 
o NOR5/OM60 cells were detected further up the Yangtze River at a freshwater reference site with 0.2 psu salinity 
OR5/OM60 cells were present in all the samples, with no obvious trend from high to low latitude 
he counts were only higher, at 0.9%, in a coastal sample taken during the same cruise off Iceland (SI Table 1) 
n a transect in the Namibian coastal upwelling region along 23.001S, the NOR5/OM60 counts at depths 10–15 m decreased with ﬂuctuation from 3.0% (2.0  105 cells ml1) near the coast to 0.5% (1.3  104 cells ml1) in the open ocean (Fig. 5) 
ith a number of 3.3  105 cells ml1 (3.3% of DAPI) the counts were highest at the station closest to the coast (14.361E) at a water depth of 5 m 
he highest relative abundance of NOR5/OM60 cells encountered in this study was recorded near the North Sea island Helgoland at station ‘‘Kabeltonne’’ (54.181N 7.901E) 
n surface water samples retrieved during May–July 2007, which were preﬁltered through a 10 mm ﬁlter, members of the NOR5/OM60 clade ranged from 1.7% to 6.6% (8.2  103– 1.2  105 cells ml1) 
ounts were also high in sandy intertidal sediments taken at Janssand (53.721N, 7.681E), in the back-barrier region of the island of Spiekeroog close to the German North Sea coast

OR5/OM60 counts by CARD-FISH in the Namibian upwelling region on March 22–23, 2003, along 231S near Walvis Bay 
he counts were mostly at a depth of 10 m, with the exception of the two easternmost points that were at a depth of 15 m.  Discussion The interest in the NOR5/OM60 clade has signiﬁcantly increased with the discovery that this clade encompasses the elusive marine gammaproteobacterial branch of AAnPs [12,22] 
he data obtained in this study clearly support the hypothesis of a cosmopolitan  Fig. 6 
he presence of NOR5/OM60 is now conﬁrmed for all oceans except the Indian Ocean, which has still not yet been examined in this regard 
everal lines of evidence suggest that members of the NOR5/OM60 clade are generally more abundant in coastal areas than in open-ocean settings 
ully independent support for this ﬁnding comes from the GOS dataset [52] in which the frequency of NOR5/OM60 16S rRNA gene sequences was signiﬁcantly higher in coastal stations (1.4%) than in open-ocean stations (0.3%) 
evertheless, these data cannot be directly translated into cell frequencies since the number of rRNA operons per genome is quite different in marine bacteria [31] 
ur large CARD-FISH dataset also provides convincing support for a preference of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade for the euphotic zone, which had been reported for the coastal Paciﬁc Newport Hydroline station [12] 
owever, since the absence of NOR5/OM60 sequences is not valid proof of their absence per se, other methods, such as quantitative PCR, need to be applied to quantify NOR5/OM60 in these deep water layers 
here are indications for strong seasonal ﬂuctuation of the NOR5/OM60 abundance in coastal waters 
he photoheterotrophic members of the NOR5/OM60 clade beneﬁt from algal photosynthesis, yet it is too early to speculate on a speciﬁc link to particular algal species 
n the Namibian transect, NOR5/OM60 abundance was highly correlated to turbidity (r2 ¼ 0.79) (Fig. 7a) 
imilarly, in the surface waters of the Yangtze River estuary, the NOR5/OM60 abundance showed a strong positive correlation with chlorophyll concentration (r2 ¼ 0.74) (Fig. 7c) 
o, it might be advantageous to stay close to the site of production of these substrates 
orrelation of NOR5/OM60 to other environmental parameters: (a) turbidity in the Namibian transect, (b) chlorophyll ﬂuorescence in the Namibian transect, (c) chlorophyll in the Yangtze River estuary.  ARTICLE IN PRESS 136  S 
lso, during the North Atlantic Vision cruise, the NOR5/OM60 proportion in the surface water (10 m) showed no obvious correlation with any detected parameters (latitude, temperature, total DAPI cell count or chlorophyll ﬂuorescence) 
or bacteria with a dominantly heterotrophic metabolism, photosynthesis might just be an accessory energy source that may not be required by all members of the NOR5/OM60 clade 
urther studies that might combine the in situ identiﬁcation of NOR5/OM60 cells by CARD-FISH with the direct identiﬁcation of AAnP using infrared ﬂuorescence microscopy [29,53] are therefore needed 
nly then could we directly determine how many NOR5/OM60 are AAnPs, and, vice versa, how many of the AAnP are NOR5/OM60 
hey have assessed the diversity of marine AAnPs based on comparative analysis of pufM sequences retrieved from the metagenomic libraries of the GOS [52]

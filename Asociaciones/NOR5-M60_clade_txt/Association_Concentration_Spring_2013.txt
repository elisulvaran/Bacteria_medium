 train Rap1red shared a 16S rRNA sequence identity of 99 % with the type strain of Congregibacter litoralis and was genome-sequenced to reveal the extent of genetic microheterogeneity among closely related strains within this clade 
 n affiliation of the characterized bacteriochlorophyll a-containing strains to different genera was indicated by significant phenotypic differences and pufLM nucleotide sequence identity values below 82 % 
 trains belonging to this phylogenetic group represented about 10 % of all redpigmented colonies and could be affiliated either to the NOR5-3 or NOR5-1 lineage within this clade based on analyses of their 16S rRNA gene sequences 13 
 olonies of Ivo14T appeared on Marine Agar 2216 after an incubation time of approx . 7 days at 28°C and were dark red round concave smooth and reached a diameter of 1 mm 
 n contrast colonies of C. litoralis and Chromatocurvus halotolerans reached a diameter of approx . 2 mm and appeared already after 3 days 
 hotosynthetic apparatus and cytochrome composition In vivo absorption spectra of pigmented cells of strain Ivo14T revealed near-infrared peaks at 801 and 871 nm indicating presence of a reaction center embedded in a light-harvesting complex 1 LH1 
 he near-infrared band of the BChl a incorporated in the LH1 complex of Ivo14T was significantly blue–shifted compared to the related species Chromatocurvus halotolerans and C. litoralis which displayed peaks at 877 and 876 nm in the respective spectra 
 pectra of acetone/ methanol extracts showing the characteristic peaks of BChl a and spirilloxanthin . rubra showed a clearly distinct profile with major peaks at 804 and 821 nm and only a small peak at 871 nm Figure 2A 
 V/visible spectroscopy of acetone/methanol extracts of pigmented Ivo14T cells resulted in peaks that are typical for BChl a 363 600 and 771 nm and spirilloxanthin 465 495 and 529 nm 
 n dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized redox difference spectra a Soret peak at 421-422 nm and an alpha peak at 553-554 nm indicates that c-type cytochromes were dominating 
 dditional b-type cytochromes could be identified by a shoulder of the Soret band around 434 nm in spectra of cell-free extracts of strain Ivo14T and Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T whereas a shoulder around 445 nm suggests the presence of cytochromes containing heme a in Ivo14T and H. rubra DSM 19751T 
 rowth characteristics Growth of strain Ivo14T was observed in the range of pH 7.0 to 9.0 and 12 to 32°C with an optimum at pH 8.0 and 28°C 
 n subsequent experiments a combination of Lhistidine and L-cysteine each in a concentration of 250 μM was shown to be optimal for growth and expression of photosynthetic pigments in strain Ivo14T 
 oth values are close to the determined DNA G + C content of C. litoralis 57.7 mol % 8 but significantly lower than in Chromatocurvus halotolerans 63 mol % 31 ) and H. rubra 66.1 mol % determined by genome sequence analysis this study ) ) 
 hylogeny and evolution of the photosynthetic apparatus Based on 16S rRNA gene identity values the newly isolated strain Ivo14T is only distantly related to described type strains of the OM60/NOR5 clade including Halioglobus pacificus S1-27T 94.6 % , H. rubra Page 9 of 21 CM41_15aT 94.6 % , C. litoralis KT71T 94.6 % , H. mediterranea 7SM29T 94.4 % and Chromatocurvus halotolerans EG19T 93.7 % 
 n the other hand strain Rap1red shows a close phylogenetic relationship with C. litoralis KT71T 99.0 % and H. rubra CM41_15aT 96.8 % , comprising together the NOR5-3 line of descent 
 he type strains of H. rubra and C. litoralis share a 16S rRNA sequence identity value of 97 % which indicates a close phylogenetic relationship 
 n evolving specialization to a distinct type of metabolism could be also reflected in the observed reduction of the genome size among photoheterotrophic members of the OM60/ NOR5 clade The genomes of C. litoralis and Rap1red have an estimated size of 4.3 and 4.2 million base pairs Mb whereas in the strains HTCC2080 Ivo14T and Himb55 which all belong to the NOR5-1 lineage considerably smaller genome sizes of 3.6 3.3 and 2.7 Mb respectively , were found 
 ccording to the GGDC the estimated DNA-DNA similarity value between the two most closely related strains C. litoralis DSM 17192T and Rap1red was only 19.8 % ± 8.1 % and thus clearly below 70 % which is the widely accepted threshold value for assigning strains to the same species 
 lthough the 16S RNA gene identity value between the type strains of C. litoralis and H. rubra is only 97 % it is close to the traditionally used threshold value above which the affiliation of strains to the same species should be tested by DNA-DNA similarity experiments 50 
 he obtained result was 21.3 % average of two measurements and hence as expected below the threshold value of 70 % 
 he 16S rRNA gene identity values observed among cultured members of the OM60/NOR5 clade range from 91 to 99 % with low divergence values between chemoheterotrophic and photoheterotrophic representatives 
 n that study pufLM nucleotide sequence identity values below 86 % and 81 % correlated with membership to different genera in Chromatiaceae and Ectothiorhodospiraceae respectively 37 
 pplying the lower threshold value to the OM60/ NOR5 clade it turns out that only the closely related strains C. litoralis DSM17192T and Rap1red belong to the same genus sharing a pufLM nucleotide sequence identity value of 82.7 % 
 he pufLM genes of the two strains H. rubra DSM 19751T GenBank KC253226 and Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T GenBank JX311416 have a sequence identity of 80.7 % but an affiliation of both strains to the same genus would be in contradiction to phenotypic and 16S rRNA sequence data 
 mong all other photoheterotrophic representatives of this clade the pufLM sequence identity values are in the range between 69.3 and 76.6 % and hence clearly below the genus level 
 or instance the identity level of the pufLM genes of the two strains Ivo14T and HTCC2080 is only 73.6 % despite a close relationship at the 16S rRNA gene sequence level 96.1 % 
 espite some minor variations depending on the analyzed phylogenetic group the proposed value for the rpoB gene sequence identity level of strains belonging to the same species is above 98 % and for species of a single genus above approx . 85 % 54,56 
 ccordingly the rpoB nucleotide sequence identity between the strains C. litoralis DSM 17192T and Rap1red 84.9 % would indicate an affiliation to the same genus whereas all other values determined among genome sequenced members of the OM60/NOR5 clade were below 80 % 72.2-77.8 % , which is in good agreement with conclusions deduced from the pufLM sequence identity values 
 comparison of the determined sequences with the available rpoB data set revealed that all identity values were below 85 % except between H. rubra and Chromatocurvus halotolerans which share an rpoB gene sequence identity value of 86.5 % 
 his value is unusually high compared to an rpoB sequence identity value of 80.1 % between H. rubra and C. litoralis which even share a higher 16S rRNA gene identity of 97.0 %

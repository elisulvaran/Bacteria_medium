ellular fatty acid patterns of strain Ivo14T, Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T, Pseudohaliea (= Haliea) rubra DSM 19751T and Congregibacter litoralis DSM 17192T in correlation to the oxygen concentration in the head space gas atmosphere during growth in SYPHC medium 
 or incubation of cultures in closed serum vials under defined gas atmospheres the SYPHC medium was slightly modified: All compounds, except the HEPES buffer which was omitted, were dissolved in water and then the solution was sparged with a 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture for 45 min to remove dissolved oxygen 
 he pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.3 – 7.5 after autoclaving by adding Na2CO3 from a sterile and anoxic stock solution (5% w/v) that was prepared under a 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas atmosphere

 olonies of Ivo14T appeared on Marine Agar 2216 after an incubation time of approx. 7 days at 28°C and were dark red, round, concave, smooth and reached a diameter of 1 mm 
 n contrast, colonies of C. litoralis and Chromatocurvus halotolerans reached a diameter of  approx. 2 mm and appeared already after 3 days 
 he near-infrared band of the BChl a incorporated in the LH1 complex of Ivo14T was significantly blue–shifted compared to the related species Chromatocurvus halotolerans and C. litoralis, which displayed peaks at 877 and 876 nm in the respective spectra 
 pectra of acetone/ methanol extracts showing the characteristic peaks of BChl a and spirilloxanthin.  rubra showed a clearly distinct profile with major peaks at 804 and 821 nm and only a small peak at 871 nm (Figure 2A) 
 n dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized redox difference spectra a Soret peak at 421-422 nm and an alpha peak at 553-554 nm indicates that c-type cytochromes were dominating 
 dditional b-type cytochromes could be identified by a shoulder of the Soret band around 434 nm in spectra of cell-free extracts of strain Ivo14T and Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T, whereas a shoulder around 445 nm suggests the presence of cytochromes containing heme a in Ivo14T and H. rubra DSM 19751T 
 rowth characteristics  Growth of strain Ivo14T was observed in the range of pH 7.0 to 9.0 and 12 to 32°C, with an optimum at pH 8.0 and 28°C 
 n subsequent experiments a combination of Lhistidine and L-cysteine, each in a concentration of 250 μM, was shown to be optimal for growth and expression of photosynthetic pigments in strain Ivo14T 
 n evolving specialization to a distinct type of metabolism could be also reflected in the observed reduction of the genome size among photoheterotrophic members of the OM60/ NOR5 clade: The genomes of C. litoralis and Rap1red have an estimated size of 4.3 and 4.2 million base pairs (Mb), whereas in the strains HTCC2080, Ivo14T and Himb55, which all belong to the NOR5-1 lineage considerably smaller genome sizes of 3.6, 3.3 and 2.7 Mb, respectively, were found 
 he dimensions of cells grown in SYPHC medium varies between 1.2 and 2.2 μm in length and 0.6 μm in width 
 olonies appear after about 7 days on plates of Marine Agar 2216 and are round, concave, smooth and dark red 
 ptimal growth conditions are at 28°C, pH 8 and a salinity of approx. 3% (w/v) NaCl 
 he dimensions of cells grown in SYPHC medium varies between 1.2 and 1.6 μm in length and 0.6 μm in width 
 olonies appear after about 10 to 14 days on plates of Marine Agar 2216 and are round, concave, smooth and dark red 
 he in vivo absorption of BChl a in the near-infrared region of the spectrum shows two main peaks at 804 and 821 nm and a minor peak at 871 nm, indicating the presence of a light-harvesting complex 3 along with small amounts of a lightharvesting complex 1 
 ptimal growth conditions are at 30°C, pH 8 and a salinity of approx. 3.5% (w/v) NaCl 
 fter transportation to the laboratory additional 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions of the original sediment samples were prepared in artificial seawater, then 50 or 200 μl aliquots of each sample were spread on agar plates of Plarich medium supplemented with the antibiotics ampicillin and cycloheximide added in a concentration of 2.0 g/l each

 he corresponding values for strains Ivo14T, DSM 23344T and DSM 19751T were 0.68, 0.74 and 0.85 mg dry weight per A660nm 
 arbon sources were added in various concentrations that depended on the approximate size of the respective molecule: 20 mM (1-2 carbon atoms), 10 mM (3-4 carbon atoms), 5 mM (5-6 carbon atoms), 2.5 mM (7-8 carbon atoms) and 1 mM (>9 carbon atoms) 
 CR amplification of genomic DNA was carried out using the HotMasterMix 2.5x from 5 PRIME (Hamburg, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol or the Taq DNA polymerase from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) in reaction buffer containing 200 μM (each) deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), 1 μM (each) oligonucleotide primers and ca. 10 – 25 ng of genomic DNA in a final volume of 20 μl

 bundance of the LH1 complex in living cells, estimated by determination of A870 nm/A660 nm ratios, reached maximal values of 0.80 to 0.83 
 his expression level of the LH1 complex corresponded to a measured BChl a concentration of around 1.2 nmol/mg cellular dry weight 
 he NaCl concentration suitable for growth was 1 - 9% (w/v), the optimum at 3% (w/v) 
 he growth-stimulating effect was not concentration dependent within the tested range of up to 500 μmol/l 
 n our hands the BIOLOG assay used by Urios et al. [18] for the physiological characterization of H. rubra was not satisfactory for photoheterotrophic members of the OM60/NOR5 clade, because neither H. rubra DSM 19751T nor C. litoralis DSM 17192T or Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T showed a clear response in BIOLOG plates, at least after an incubation period of 1 - 2 weeks

 rowth on a carbon source was verified by measurements of the optical density in aliquots of the culture in intervals of two or three days until stationary phase was reached

 t the end a postelongation at 68°C for 1.5 min was carried out 
 rowth of H. rubra on Marine Agar 2216 was strongly inhibited compared to SYPHC agar, so that pin point colonies were only visible after an incubation period of 10 to 14 days

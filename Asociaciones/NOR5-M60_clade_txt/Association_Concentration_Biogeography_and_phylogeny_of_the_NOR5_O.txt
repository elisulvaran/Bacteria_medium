 elative abundances in coastal marine waters off Namibia and the Yangtze estuary were up to 3 % of the total 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole DAPI counts and in the German Bight off Helgoland the abundance was even up to 7 % 
 n an open-ocean North Atlantic transect between Iceland and the Azores the NOR5/OM60 group was much less abundant 0.1–0.5 %

Design and optimization of probes for the quantiﬁcation of the NOR5/OM60 clade Our comprehensive collection of 16S rRNA sequences of the NOR5/OM60 clade facilitated a re-evaluation of oligonucleotide probes targeting this group

 combination of the probes NOR5-730 and NOR5-1238 increased the current coverage of the NOR5/OM60 clade to 92 % without any outgroup hits Fig . 2 
 he application of two helpers per probe signiﬁcantly increased the intensity of monolabeled and CARD-FISH signals

 he counts were mostly at a depth of 10 m with the exception of the two easternmost points that were at a depth of 15 m. Discussion The interest in the NOR5/OM60 clade has signiﬁcantly increased with the discovery that this clade encompasses the elusive marine gammaproteobacterial branch of AAnPs 12,22 
 ully independent support for this ﬁnding comes from the GOS dataset 52 in which the frequency of NOR5/OM60 16S rRNA gene sequences was signiﬁcantly higher in coastal stations 1.4 % than in open-ocean stations 0.3 % 
 evertheless these data can not be directly translated into cell frequencies since the number of rRNA operons per genome is quite different in marine bacteria 31 
 owever since the absence of NOR5/OM60 sequences is not valid proof of their absence per se other methods such as quantitative PCR need to be applied to quantify NOR5/OM60 in these deep water layers 
 imilarly in the surface waters of the Yangtze River estuary the NOR5/OM60 abundance showed a strong positive correlation with chlorophyll concentration r2 ¼ 0.74 ( Fig . 7c 
 lso during the North Atlantic Vision cruise the NOR5/OM60 proportion in the surface water 10 m showed no obvious correlation with any detected parameters latitude temperature total DAPI cell count or chlorophyll ﬂuorescence

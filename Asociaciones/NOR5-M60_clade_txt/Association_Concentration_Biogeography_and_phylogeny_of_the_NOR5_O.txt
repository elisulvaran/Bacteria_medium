 esults of the CARD-FISH with probe NOR5-730 and NOR5-1238 were also included in the map.  Sampling sites and procedures  Samples were taken from a depth of 1 m at station ‘‘Kabeltonne’’, Helgoland (54.181N, 7.901E), German Bight, on seven separate days from May to July 2007 (see Table 2 for details) and from Cuxhaven in July 2007 
 or FISH, samples were carefully thawed, ﬁltered onto polycarbonate ﬁlters (Millipore, 47 mm in diameter, 0.2 mm pore size) and further processed for FISH (see below).  CARD-FISH CARD-FISH was undertaken according to Pernthaler et al. [49] with the following modiﬁcations: agaroseembedded ﬁlters were permeabilized with 10 mg ml1  ARTICLE IN PRESS 128  Table 2.  S

 ybridization was performed at 46 1C for 3 h, and washing was carried out at 48 1C for 15 min 
 he application of two helpers per probe signiﬁcantly increased the intensity of monolabeled and CARD-FISH signals 
 ixed cells of Congregibacter litoralis KT71 were used to determine the optimal formamide concentration for hybridization of probes NOR5-730 and NOR-1238 as 50% 
 hese two probes were subsequently used at this formamide concentration in combination with helpers NOR5-659h, NOR5-709h, NOR5-1217h and NOR51287h for a speciﬁc and sensitive identiﬁcation of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade in environmental samples.  Quantiﬁcation of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade by CARD-FISH The cells detected by CARD-FISH with the probe mixture NOR5-730/NOR5-1238 in marine plankton and benthos samples were pleomorphic (Fig. 4), often from coccoid to rod-shaped, sometimes were also bent  in a vibrio shape 
 elow 70 m, the counts became marginal (o0.05%), and NOR5/OM60 cells were not detected below 300 m 
 n fosmid libraries constructed from bacterioplankton samples at Aloha Station, Hawaii, 16S rRNA genes of the NOR5/OM60 clade were detected at depths of 10 m and 70 m, but not at 130 m or deeper [17] 
 n a transect in the Namibian coastal upwelling region along 23.001S, the NOR5/OM60 counts at depths 10–15 m decreased with ﬂuctuation from 3.0% (2.0  105 cells ml1) near the coast to 0.5% (1.3  104 cells ml1) in the open ocean (Fig. 5) 
 ith a number of 3.3  105 cells ml1 (3.3% of DAPI) the counts were highest at the station closest to the coast (14.361E) at a water depth of 5 m 
 evertheless, these data cannot be directly translated into cell frequencies since the number of rRNA operons per genome is quite different in marine bacteria [31] 
 owever, since the absence of NOR5/OM60 sequences is not valid proof of their absence per se, other methods, such as quantitative PCR, need to be applied to quantify NOR5/OM60 in these deep water layers 
 imilarly, in the surface waters of the Yangtze River estuary, the NOR5/OM60 abundance showed a strong positive correlation with chlorophyll concentration (r2 ¼ 0.74) (Fig. 7c)

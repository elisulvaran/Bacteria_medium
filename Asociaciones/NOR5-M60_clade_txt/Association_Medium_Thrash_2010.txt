⫹C mol % measurements were computed using the genome sequence and calculated using Practical Extraction and Reporting Language PERL 
he draft genomes of HTCC2148 and HTCC2080 comprised 4,310,225 and 3,576,081 bases 3,866 and 3,229 predicted open reading frames ORFs and 52.96 % and 51.82 % G⫹C contents , respectively 
he HTCC2148 genome is predicted to have 39 tRNA genes and two each of the 5S 16S and 23S rRNA genes that of HTCC2080 is predicted to have 41 tRNA genes and one each of the 5S 16S and 23S rRNA genes 
hese organisms may be deficient in B6 and thiamine production however and HTCC2080 has no predicted genes for biotin production 
oth genomes have putative catalase and alcohol and formate dehydrogenase genes 
TCC2080 contains some predicted phototrophy genes including a predicted reaction-center H chain and both contain predicted phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase genes indicating the potential for autotrophy in these organisms 
he draft genome sequences of Gammaproteobacteria HTCC2148 and HTCC2080 have the accession numbers ABXQ00000000 and AAVV00000000 respectively in GenBank 
ata annotated independently with GenDB are also accessible in the Marine Microbial Genomics database at Oregon State University http //bioinfo.cgrb.oregonstate.edu/microbes/ . Strains HTCC2148 and HTCC2080 are members of the important OM60/NOR5 clade of the oligotrophic marine Gammaproteobacteria OMG which includes the aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotroph Congregibacter litoralis KT71 in addition to many species of chemoheterotrophs 6 , 7 
rganisms from this clade are detected globally throughout the euphotic zone 1 5 14 and can make up a significant portion ⱕ11 % of bacterial cells in some locations 1 6 12 14 
onsistent with this distribution HTCC2148 and HTCC2080 were isolated from Oregon coastal water collected at hydrostation NH5 from a depth of 10 m 2 
sing dilution-toextinction culturing methods previously described 3 13 , these organisms were cultivated in low-nutrient heterotrophic medium LNHM ( 2 and selected for sequencing due to their phylogenetic affiliation 
raig Venter Institute and the draft genomes of HTCC2148 and HTCC2080 containing 75 ABXQ01000001 to ABXQ01000075 and 25 AAVV01000001 to AAVV01000025 contigs respectively were annotated with the GenDB annotation application program 9 at the Center for Genome Research and Biocomputing at Oregon State University similarly to that previously described 10 11 
utoannotation was completed by merging results from the Glimmer 2.0 modeling package 4 and contrasting to Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for Proteins BLASTp 
he protein set was additionally searched against the KEGG SwissProt Clusters of Orthologous Groups COG Pfam and Interpro protein databases to annotate EC number gene call , and gene description

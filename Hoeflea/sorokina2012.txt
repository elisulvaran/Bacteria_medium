Abstract—A new representative of neutrophilic ironoxidizing bacteria was isolated from the ironcontaining
sediments of the brackish lowtemperature ironrich spring of the Staraya Russa Resort (Novgorod region,
Russia). The cells of strain Hf1 were thin, slightly curved rods, motile by means of a single polar flagellum.
The bacterium reproduced by binary division and was capable of producing rosettes. Optimal growth was
observed within the pH range of 6.2–8.5 (with an optimum at 7.5), at 9–38°C (with an optimum at 30°C),
and in the salinity range of 0.1–8.5% NaCl (with an optimum at 1%). The organism was a facultative anaer
obe. The strain was capable of mixotrophic and organoheterotrophic growth. Fe(II) oxidation occurred
–

under anaerobic conditions via reduction of NO 3 and N2O, or under microaerobic conditions with oxygen
as an electron acceptor. According to phylogenetic analysis based on the comparison of the 16S rRNA gene
sequences, the strain was closest to the organotrophic marine bacterium Hoeflea phototrophica (98.5% simi
larity). The level of DNA–DNA homology with the type species of the genus Hoeflea was 19%. The DNA
G + C base content was 57.5 mol %. According to its phenotypic and chemotaxonomic properties, as well as
to the results of phylogenetic analysis, strain Hf1 was classified into the genus Hoeflea of the family Phyllo
bacteriaceae, order Rhizobiales of the phylum Alphaproteobacteria as a novel species, Hoeflea siderophila sp.
nov. The type strain is Hf1T (=DSM 21587 = VKM A7094). The GenBank accession number for the 16S
rRNA gene sequences of strain Hf1T is EU670237.

The capacity for utilizing Fe(II) as an inorganic
electron donor in the electron transport chain is
shared by a small number of bacteria belonging to sev
eral taxonomic groups. Up to the end of the 1980s,
lithotrophic ironoxidizing bacteria were represented
only by acidophilic microorganisms growing at a pH
of less than 4.5, when Fe(II) is resistant to chemical
oxidation with the oxygen of air. Since the end of the
1980s, some attempts have been made to apply the
radioisotope method with 14СO2 to confirm that the
previously described ironoxidizing bacterium Gal
lionella ferruginea [1] could grow chemolitho
autotrophically with Fe(II) as an energy source under
neutral ambient conditions [2]. Few representatives of
ironoxidizing bacteria are able to oxidize Fe(II)

deepwater marine hydrotherms [5, 6], and plant
rhizosphere [7].
Due to the difficulties in both isolation and cultiva
tion, the physiological properties of neutrophilic
lithotrophic ironoxidizing bacteria are poorly under
stood. Over the past 20 years, only two species of
Betaproteobacteria [8] and the only representative of
the new phylum Zetaproteobacteria [5, 9] have been
described. The taxonomic position of some recently
isolated strains remains underdetermined [3, 4, 6,
10, 11].
All isolates are capable of Fe(II) oxidation under
anaerobic conditions coupled to reduction of oxidized
–
–
nitrogen compounds ( NO 3 , NO 2 , and N2O). All
known strains are mixotrophs; capacity for chem
olithoautotrophic growth was strictly confirmed only
for two species [2, 8].
In the present work, the results of our study of the
new strain of neutrophilic facultatively anaerobic
ironoxidizing bacteria isolated from the brackish,
lowtemperature, ironrich spring of the Staraya
Russa Resort (Novgorod region, Russia) are pre
sented.

zone in such aquatic ecosystems as sediments formed
where groundwater is brought to the surface [3, 4],

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation source. Samples of water and newly
formed ochreous precipitates from the lowtempera
ture mineral ironrich spring no. 8 of the Staraya
Russa Resort (Novgorod region, Russia) were the sub
jects of this study. The spring is allied with the water
bearing bed of the ancient Devon sea. Total mineral
ization of the water was 20 g l–1; the water temperature
varied from 11 to 14°C; pH was 7.0; oxygen was not
detected near the spring outlet. The Fe(II) content in
the water was 3 mg l–1.
Quantitative assessment and conditions of isolation
and cultivation of ironoxidizing bacteria. The numbers
of ironoxidizing bacteria were determined with ten
fold dilutions in Hungate tubes filled to capacity with
agarized medium. The cultivation medium contained
the following (g L–1): NaCl, 20; NH4Cl, 0.3; CaCl2 ⋅
6H2O, 0.3; MgCl2 ⋅ 7H2O, 3; NaHCO3, 0.5; 10%
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1; Hepes buffer (pH 7.2),
3.0; KNO3, 0.3; CH3COONa, 0.15; vitamins and
trace elements [12]; Difco agar, 5.0; pH 7.0. The cul
tivation temperature was 28°C. Before inoculation,
the medium was supplemented with the fresh sterile
FeS suspension [13] (0.2 mL per 10 mL of medium).
Inoculated media were incubated for 2–3 weeks.
The pure culture of strain Hf1 was isolated with
tenfold dilutions on the abovedescribed agarized
medium; the obtained ochreous colonies were trans
ferred to liquid medium.
Cell morphology and ultrastructure. Cell morphol
ogy was studied under an Olympus CX31 phase con
trast microscope (Japan). Ultrathin sections were
obtained using the standard methods. The cells grown
on ironfree medium were stained with phosphotung
stic acid; ironencrusted cells were not stained. Whole
cell preparations and ultrathin sections were examined
under a JEM100C electron microscope (JEOL,
Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.
Cultural and analytical methods. The ability of
ironoxidizing bacteria to utilize various carbon
sources was tested using the abovedescribed mineral
medium. The capacity for utilizing various nitrogen
sources was tested using the abovedescribed mineral
medium with sodium acetate and without NH4Cl.
Carbon and nitrogen sources were added to a concen
tration of 0.5 g L–1.
The content of Fe(II) in the water samples was
determined on a KFK3 spectrophotometer (Russia)
using α,αdipyridyl [14].
The concentration of dissolved oxygen was deter
mined with a Hanna HI 9142 oximeter (Finland) at
the sampling site; the pH of the water was determined
with a portable Hanna Checker 1 pH meter (Finland).
The content of N2 in the gas phase was determined
using a Kristall 5000.1 gas chromatograph (Chro
matec, Russia).

–

–

The contents of NO 3 , NO 2 were determined on a
Staier liquid anion exchange chromatograph (Russia).
Biochemical methods. Nitrate and nitrite reductase
activities were determined with methyl viologen using
the standard techniques [15, 16].
Catalase and oxidase activities in the cell suspen
sion were determined according to the standard pro
cedure [17, 18].
Resistance to antibiotics was determined using the
test discs (Difco Laboratories, United States) [19].
Protein content was determined by the Lowry
method. The cell suspension obtained on the medium
with ferrous iron was pretreated with 1% oxalic acid
for 3–5 min in order to dissolve iron oxides.
Analysis of the fatty acid composition of the cells of
strain Hf1. The fatty acids were analyzed by gas chro
matography and mass spectrometry with a Sherlock
gas chromatograph (Microbial Identification System,
MIDI Inc., United States) according to the standard
procedure [20].
Molecular genetic analysis. DNA extraction. To
disintegrate bacterial cells, they were subjected three
times to a freezing–thawing procedure (at –70 and
50°С, respectively); the cell suspension was then
heated at 80°С for 5 min [21]. DNA was extracted by
the phenol method [22].
The DNA G+C base content was determined by the
method of Owen et al. [23].
The DNA homology level was determined by the
optical reassociation method [24].
PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was car
ried out with the universal eubacterial primers 27f
(5'AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG3') and 1492r
(5'TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT3') [25, 26].
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out
on a GeneAmp PCR System 2700 thermocycler
(Applied Biosystems, United States).
Determination of the 16S rRNA gene sequences was
carried out on a CEQ 2000 XL automatic sequencer
(Beckman Coulter, United States) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Phylogenetic analysis. For identification of the
microorganisms closely related to the obtained strain,
the 16S rRNA gene sequences were compared to those
of the type strains from the RDBII (Ribosomal Data
base Project, http://rdp.cme.msu.edu) and NCBI
(National Center for Biotechnology Information,
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
databases.
The
obtained 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned using
the Clustal W software package [27]. The phylogenetic
tree was constructed by the methods implemented in
the Treecon software package [28]. The GenBank
accession number for the 16S rRNA gene sequences of
strain Hf1T is EU670237.

RESULTS
Quantitative assessment and isolation of pure cul
tures. The total number of ironoxidizing bacteria in
the spring water did not exceed 10 cells/mL; in the
ironcontaining precipitates, it was 105–107 cells/mL.
For the isolation of ironoxidizing bacteria, samples of
fresh ochreous sediments collected near the outlet of
the ironrich spring were used as inoculum.
On the agarized medium, the strain produced small
(1–3 mm in diameter), dense spherical colonies,
orangecolored due to the formation of iron oxides. In
the liquid medium of the same composition, an ochre
ous precipitate was formed.
Cell morphology and ultrastructure. The cells of
strain Hf1 were thin, slightly curved rods (0.4 × 0.9–
2.2 μm), motile by means of a single polar flagellum
(Figs. 1a, 1c, and 1d). The cells reproduced by binary
division. The bacterium was capable of forming
rosettes (Fig. 1a). During growth in the medium with
ferrous iron, iron oxides were deposited on the cell
surface (Fig. 1b). The cell wall is of the gramnegative
type.
Cultural properties. The temperature range for the
growth of strain Hf1 was 9–38°C, with an optimum at
30°C; the pH range for growth was 6.2–8.5, with an

optimum at 7.5. The isolate grew at a NaCl concentra
tion of 0.1–8.5%, with an optimum at 1%.
Physiological and biochemical properties. Oxida
tion of Fe(II) compounds. During growth of ironoxi
dizing bacteria under anaerobic conditions in the min
–

eral medium with NO 3 as an electron acceptor and
FeSO4 as an electron donor, oxidation of Fe(II)
occurred primarily via bacterial oxidation; however,
up to 20% of Fe(II) was oxidized in the chemical reac
tion with the newly formed nitrite (Table 1). When
–

NO 3 was replaced with N2O, chemical oxidation of
Fe(II) was insignificant (Table 2).
Strain Hf1 was capable of both mixotrophic and
organotrophic growth under microaerobic or anaero
–

bic conditions; in the latter case, it utilized NO 3 , N2O
as electron acceptors. During lithotrophic growth, it
utilized FeS, FeSO4, and FeCO3 as Fe(II) sources.
Under anaerobic conditions, strain Hf1 was not able
–

–

2–

to utilize NO 2 , ClO 4 , S0, S 2 O 3 , and Fe(OH)3 as
electron acceptors. During growth in the mineral
medium, H2 was not utilized as an electron donor.

During organotrophic growth under anaerobic

–
conditions, strain Hf1 reduced NO 3 only to NO 2 via
the interrupted chain of denitrification.
–

Accumulation of NO 2 inhibited growth of the
–

ironoxidizing bacterium. When NO 3 was replaced
with N2O, growth was not inhibited and was accompa
nied by accumulation of N2 in the gas phase:

N2 .

Growth was inhibited due to accumulation of
–
NO 2 , which resulted from low rates of enzymatic
activity involved in the chain of reactions causing a
reduction of nitrogen compounds: the activity of
nitrate reductase was 30 nmol/mL per 1 mg of protein,
while the activity of nitrite reductase did not exceed
0.6 nmol/mL per 1 mg of protein.
Carbon and nitrogen sources. During aerobic orga
notrophic growth, strain Hf1 utilized acetate, succi
nate, citrate, lactate, malate, fumarate, propionate,
pyruvate, butyrate, propanol, glycerol, a wide range
of sugars, including ribose, xylose, D,Larabinose,
D,Lglucose, dextrose, fructose, Lsorbose, galac

tose, Dmannose, 2deoxyglucose, sucrose, Dlac
tose, trehalose, Dmaltose, cellobiose, melibiose,
melizitose, Draffinose, Lrhamnose, L,CH3gluco
side, Dglucuronic acid, Minositol, Merythritol,
Larabitol, Dglucosamine, Nacetylglucosamine,
as well as dextrin, glycogen, yeast extract, and pep
tone, as carbon sources. Weak growth was observed on
media with some amino acids, including phenylala
nine, tryptophan, and histidine. The strain was not
able to utilize oxalate, formate, benzoate, ethanol,
buthanol, proline, leucine, alanine, asparagine,
glutamine, aspartic and glutamic acids, or casein
hydrolysate.
The microorganism utilized ammonium salts,
–
NO 3 , N2O, urea, yeast extract, and peptone, and did
–

not utilize NO 2 , histidine, aspartic and glutamic
acids, and casein hydrolysate as nitrogen sources.
The predominant fatty acids were 11octadecenoic
(18:1ω7с; 60.48%), hexadecanoic (16:0; 14.65%), and
11methyloctadecenoic
(11Methyl
18:1ω7с;
10.94%).
The strain was sensitive to polymyxin, rifampicin,
and tetramycin and resistant to amikacin, bacitracin,
kanamycin, mycostatin, and penicillin.

The levels of 16S rRNA similarity between strain
Hf1 and H. phototrophica DFL43T, H. alexandrii

DISCUSSION
The isolated strain of neutrophilic facultative
anaerobic ironoxidizing bacteria shared common
properties with members of the genus Hoeflea. How
ever, comparative analysis of the results of phenotypic
and genotypic studies demonstrated that strain Hf1
differed considerably from the type species and the two
other described species (Table 3).
Among the main physiological properties of this
strain are its ability to utilize Fe(II) compounds as
electron donors during lithotrophic growth, and its

anaerobic conditions.
The available data on the levels of DNA–DNA
homology between strain Hf1 and the type species
H. marina suggest similarly low levels of DNA–DNA
homology may exist between the studied strain and
H. phototrophica and H. alexandrii. Despite 1.3% dif
ference in their 16S rRNA gene sequences, the level of
DNA–DNA homology between the majority of bacte
rial taxa is lower than 70% [33]. The threshold level of
16S rRNA similarity recommending DNA–DNA
hybridization was recently lowered from 97.7 to 97.0%
for unclear reasons [34].
The results obtained support classification of strain
Hf1Т within the genus Hoeflea, family Phyllobacteri
aceae, order Rizobiales of the class Alphaproteobacteria
as a new species Hoeflea siderophila sp. nov.

Abstract A Gram-negative, aerobic, motile, straight
or curved rod-shaped marine bacterium was isolated
from marine sediment of the East Sea, Korea. The
isolated strain, JG120-1T, grows with 0–5 % (w/v)
NaCl and at 15–30 °C and pH 6–9. a-galactosidase
activity test was positive. Comparative 16S rRNA
gene sequence studies showed that this strain belonged
to the Alphaproteobacteria and was the most closely
related to Hoeflea alexandrii AM1 V30T, Hoeflea
phototrophica DFL-43T and Hoeflea marina LMG
128T (98.9, 97.9 and 97.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence
similarities, respectively). Strain JG120-1T was found
to possess summed feature 8 (C18:1x7c/C18:1x6c,
71.11 %) as the major cellular fatty acid. The major

ubiquinone was determined to be Q-10. Polar lipids
include phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine.
The G?C content of the genomic DNA of strain
JG120-1T was determined to be 57.8 mol %. DNA–
DNA relatedness data indicated that strain JG120-1T
represents a distinct species that is separate from H.
phototrophica DFL-43T, H. marina LMG128T and H.
alexandrii AM1 V30T. On the basis of polyphasic
evidences, it is proposed that strain JG120-1T
(= KCTC 23107T = JCM 16715T) represents the type
strain of a novel species, Hoeflea halophila sp. nov.

Introduction
According to Garrity et al. (2004), the family Phyllobacteriaceae of the order Rhizobiales of the class
Alphaproteobacteria consists of eight genera representing various origins and lifestyles: Phyllobacterium
(Knösel 1984), Aminobacter (Urakami et al. 1992),
Aquamicrobium (Bambauer et al. 1998), Defluvibacter
(Fritsche et al. 1999), ‘Candidatus Liberobacter’
(Jagoueix et al. 1994), Mesorhizobium (Jarvis et al.
1997), Nitratireductor (Labbé et al. 2004) and Pseudaminobacter (Kämpfer et al. 1999). Strain LMG 128
(=Ahrens A43 = ATCC 25654) is Gram-negative,

123

972

non-spore-forming, strictly aerobic, short, regular and
rod-shaped cells isolated from seawater of the Baltic
Sea, off the coast of the Germany and the strain
was initially included in the species Agrobacterium
ferrugineum (Ahrens et al. 1968). Agrobacterium
ferrugineum LMG 128 was reclassified as Hoeflea
marina gen. nov., sp. nov. within the family Phyllobacteriaceae, by Peix et al. (2005). Since this genus
was proposed in 2005, Hoeflea spp. have been isolated
from cultures of marine dinoflagellates and cyanobacterium: H. phototrophica from a culture of Prorocentrum lima (Biebl et al. 2006), H. alexandrii from the
toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum AL1V
(Palacios et al. 2006), H. anabaenae from heterocysts
of a strain of Anabaena (Stevenson et al. 2011). A
Hoeflea-like bacterial strain JG120-1T was isolated
from marine sediment of the East Sea, Korea, which
may expand niche diversity of the genus Hoeflea. The
aim of the present study was to determine the
taxonomic position of strain JG120-1T by using
polyphasic taxonomic characterization including
determination of phenotypic and chemotaxonomic
properties and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA
gene sequences. The isolated strain, JG120-1T, is
considered to represent a novel species of the genus
Hoeflea.

Materials and methods
Isolation and culture conditions
A sediment sample collected from the East Sea of
Korea was serially diluted with filter-sterilized
(0.22 lm pore size, Millipore) natural sea water
containing 0.1 % yeast extract (Difco). After incubation of diluted aliquots at 25 °C under aerobic
conditions for 2 weeks, the aliquot of the last dilution
showing turbidity was spread onto the same medium
with agar (1.5 %, w/v) which were incubated and at
25 °C for 2 weeks to obtain pure culture isolates.
Single colonies were purified by transferring them
onto marine agar 2216 (MA; Difco) and subjecting
them to additional incubation at 25 °C for 3 days.
Isolated strains were routinely grown in Marine Broth
2216 (MB) (Difco) or on MA for further characterization. The cultures grown in MB were supplemented
with an equal volume of glycerol solution (40 %, w/v)
before long-term storage at -80 °C. The three

123

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2013) 103:971–978

reference strains (H. alexandrii AM1V30T, H. phototrophica DFL-43T and H. marina LMG128T) for
comparative studies were obtained from the Korean
Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC, Republic of
Korea). Unless otherwise stated, all reference strains
were grown in MB or on MA under their optimal
culture conditions (Biebl et al. 2006; Palacios et al.
2006; Peix et al. 2005).
Morphological, physiological and biochemical
characterization
The Gram reaction was determined by using a Gramstain kit (Difco) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cell morphology was examined by light
microscopy (Eclipse 80i; Nikon) and transmission
electron microscope (EM-109; Carl Zeiss) after negative staining with 1 % (w/v) phosphotungstic acid.
Catalase activity was determined by bubble production in 3 % (w/v) H2O2 and oxidase activity was
determined using 1 % (w/v) tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. Motility of the cells was examined by the
semisolid agar method (Shirling and Gottlieb 1966).
Growth at different temperatures (4, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30, 35 and 40 °C) was assessed after 3 days incubation
on MA. Growth at different NaCl concentrations (0,
0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 %, w/v) was measured using
artificial sea water (ASW; 26.4 g NaCl, 0.67 g KCl,
1.36 g CaCl22H2O, 6.29 g MgSO47H2O, 4.66 g
MgCl26H2O, 0.18 g Na2CO3 per liter of distilled
water) modified from Kester et al. (1967) without
NaCl supplemented with 0.1 % (w/v) yeast extract.
The response to pH (pH 5.5–9.5 at intervals of 0.5 pH
units) was determined in MB at 30 °C for 3 days.
Three different buffers were used (final concentration,
10 mM): acetate buffer (pH 5.5); phosphate buffer
(pH 6.0–8.0); Tris buffer (pH 8.5–9.5).
The utilization of carbon sources was determined in
ASW medium containing 0.1 g yeast extract l-1 to
provide the required growth factors. The following
carbon sources were tested at a concentration of
1 g l-1 (acids as sodium salts): acetate, arabinose,
butyrate, citrate, formate, fumarate, galactose, glucose, glutamate, glycerol, lactate, lactose, lysine,
maltose, mannitol, mannose, pyruvate, sucrose, threonine, urea, xylose and yeast extract. An organism was
considered to be able to utilize a substrate if it resulted
in a significant increase in maximum OD600 compared
with controls that contained only yeast extract.

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2013) 103:971–978

Substrate utilization profiles were also determined in
this manner for H. alexandrii AM1V30T, H. phototrophica DFL-43T and H. marina LMG128T to allow
for direct comparisons to be made.
Extracellular enzyme activities were characterized
using the API ZYM kit for strain JG120-1T and
H. alexandrii AM1V30T, H. phototrophica DFL-43T
and H. marina LMG128T. Cells for inoculation were
harvested from cultures in mid-exponential phase
(OD600 0.4–0.5) in ASW medium containing 0.1 g
yeast extract l-1. Strips were inoculated and were
then incubated at 30 °C for 24 h prior to reading the
results. The sensitivity of the isolates to the following antibiotics was tested using MA plate containing
each antibiotic: ampicillin (10 lg), chloramphenicol
(25 lg), erythromycin (15 lg), gentamicin (10 lg),
kanamycin (30 lg), penicillin G (10 lg), streptomycin
(10 lg) and tetracycline (30 lg).

16S rRNA gene sequence determination
and phylogenetic analysis
Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted using a commercial genomic DNA extraction kit (Cosmo Genetech
Co. Ltd, Korea). The 16S rRNA gene was amplified
from the chromosomal DNA using the universal
bacterial primer 27F (50 -AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCT
CAG-30 , E. coli position 8–27) and 1492R (50 -TAC
GGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-30 , E. coli position
1,492–1,510) (Weisburg et al. 1991) and the purified
PCR products were sequenced by Cosmo Genetech Co.
Ltd (Korea). The nearly complete 16S rRNA gene
sequence (1,419 bp) of strain JG120-1T was obtained
by assembling the sequences with SeqMan software
(DNASTAR). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of
related taxa were obtained from the GenBank database.
Sequence alignments were performed using the
CLUSTAL_X program (Thompson et al. 1997). Gaps
were edited in the BioEdit program (Hall 1999). The
evolutionary distances were calculated using the
Kimura two-parameter model (Kimura 1983). Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the neighbor–
joining (Saitou and Nei 1987) and the minimum
evolution method (Nei et al. 1998) algorithms by using
the MEGA5 Program (Tamura et al. 2011). The
nucleotide similarity value of the 16S rRNA gene
was calculated using the EzTaxon-e program (http://
www.eztaxon.org) (Kim et al. 2012).

Chemotaxonomic characterization
Cellular fatty acids were analyzed in the isolated strain
and reference strains (H. phototrophica DFL-43T, H.
marina LMG128T and H. alexandrii AM1V30T) were
analyzed using cultures grown on MA at 30 °C and pH
7.5 for 3 days. The cellular fatty acids were saponified,
methylated and extracted according to the protocol of
the Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIDI
1999). The fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent Technologies 6890 N) and were
identified using the microbial identification software
package (version 6.1). Isoprenoid quinones were
extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), evaporated under vacuum conditions, and re-extracted in
acetone. The crude quinone in acetone was then
purified using silica gel thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) (Merck). Ubiquinone and menaquinone fractions obtained by TLC were dissolved in acetone for
HPLC analysis. HPLC analysis was performed
according to Hiraishi et al. (1996). Polar lipids of
strain JG120-1T was extracted and was analyzed by
two-dimensional ascending TLC (2D-TLC) as
described by Minnikin et al. (1984).
The G?C content of the chromosomal DNA was
analyzed as described by Gonzalez and Saiz-Jimenez
(2002). Chromosomal DNA extracted for 16S rRNA
gene amplification was used for determination of the
G?C content. RNA in the DNA solution was removed
by incubation with a mixture of ribonuclease A and T1
(each, 20 units ml-1) at 30 °C for 1 h. The production
of bacteriochlorophyll a and other photopigments by
strain JG120-1T was investigated as described by
Biebl et al. (2006).

DNA–DNA hybridization
DNA–DNA hybridization experiments were carried
out with strains JG120-1T, H. alexandrii AM1 V30T
and H. phototrophica DFL-43T using the method
described by Ezaki et al. (1989). The genomic DNA of
strain JG120-1T and reference strains (H. alexandrii
AM1V30T and H. phototrophica DFL-43T) were
extracted using a genomic DNA extraction kit
(Cosmo, Korea) and used as a probe. Probe DNAs
were biotinylated with photobiotin and were hybridized with single-stranded unlabeled chromosomal
DNA fragments of test microorganisms. The means

123

974

from three independent determinations of DNA–DNA
hybridization levels were determined.

Results and discussion
Morphological, physiological and biochemical
characteristics
Strain JG120-1T was Gram-negative, aerobic, and
straight or curved rod-shaped. Cells possessed a polar
flagellum (Fig. 1) and were motile, which is similar to
the rapid motility observed directly for Hoeflea
species reported previously (Biebl et al. 2006; Palacios
et al. 2006; Peix et al. 2005). Colonies of a diameter of
2–3 mm were beige, circular and convex with regular
edges when grown on MA 2216 (Difco) at 30 °C for
3 days. Strain JG120-1T was able to grow at 15–30 °C,
but not at 4 or above 40 °C (optimum, 25–28 °C).
Strain JG120-1T could grow in 0–5 % (w/v) NaCl
(optimum 0.5–1 %) and at pH 6.0–9.0 but not at pH
values below 5.5 or above 9.5 (optimum, pH 7.5). The
physiological characteristics of strain JG120-1T are
summarized in the species description and selective
characteristics were compared with those of closely
related type strains in Table 1. The overall properties
of JG120-1T are similar to those of other type strains of
the genus Hoeflea.

Substrate utilization profiles were determined for
strain JG120-1T as well as H. alexandrii AM1V30T, H.
phototrophica DFL-43T and H. marina LMG128T to
allow for direct comparison (Table 1 and Supplementary table S1). Strain JG120-1T was able to utilize

arabinose, citrate, fumarate, maltose, mannitol, mannose, sucrose and yeast extract. Strain JG120-1T was
not able to utilize butyrate, galactose, glucose, glutamate and pyruvate while other type strains of the genus
Hoeflea were able to utilize them.
Extracellular enzyme activities were characterized
using the API ZYM kit, and the profiles were
compared among all type strains in Table 1 and
Supplementary table S2. Among the type strains of the
genus Hoeflea, strain JG120-1T was unique in that
only it possessed a-galactosidase activity. Strain
JG120-1T was susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, penicillin G, streptomycin, tetracycline and kanamycin.
Phylogenetic characteristics
The almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of
strain JG120-1T determined in this study was comprised of 1,419 nucleotides (*93 % of the Escherichia coli 16S rRNA sequence). The highest degrees
of sequence similarity were found to be with H.
alexandrii AM1V30T (98.9 %), H. phototrophica
DFL-43T (97.9 %) and H. marina LMG128T
93/92

(97.0 %). In the analysis of phylogeny, strain JG1201T was determined to clearly belong to the lineage
Hoeflea of the Alphaproteobacteria due to the observation of suitably high bootstrap values (Fig. 2) on the
phylogenetic trees of 16S rRNA gene sequences, as
constructed based on the neighbor–joining and the
minimum evolution method algorithms.

Chemotaxonomic characteristics
Profiles of major cellular fatty acid of the strain
JG120-1T was composed of summed feature 8 (C18:1
x7c/C18:1 x6c) (71.1 %), C18:1 x7c 11 methyl
(15.1 %) and C16:0 (5.3 %) (Table 2) and its overall
profiles of fatty acid were similar to those of H.
alexandrii and H. phototrophica (Table 2). However,
there were slight differences in the proportion of fatty
acids between this study and other experimental
results of H. alexandrii AM1V30T (Palacios et al.
2006), H. phototrophica DFL-43T (Biebl et al. 2006)
and H. marina LMG128T (Peix et al. 2005) which may
be have been caused by their different cultivation,
extraction or analytical conditions.

Summed features represent groups of two or three fatty acids
that could not be separated by GLC with the MIDI system
(version 6.0)

The major ubiquinone of JG120-1T was Q-10. All
type strains of genus Hoeflea produce Q-10 as their
single respiratory lipoquinone, a common feature of
the majority of Alphaproteobacteria. The polar lipids
consisted of phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol
(SQDG), phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PME) (Supplementary
Fig. S1). The presence of PG, SQDG, PC and PME
were shared with other type strains of genus Hoeflea.
Strain JG120-1T did not contain an aminolipid which
all reference strains contained (Stevenson et al. 2011),
The G?C content of genomic DNA of strain
JG120-1T was 57.8 mol % which is in the range
(53.1–59.7 mol %) of type strains of the genus
Hoeflea.

123

The absorption spectrum lacked the peaks of
bacteriochlorophyll a and a carotenoid that were
detected in H. phototrophica (Biebl et al. 2006). Thus,
strain JG120-1T is similar to H. alexandrii and H.
marina in terms of photopigments (Palacios et al.
2006).
DNA–DNA hybridization
The DNA–DNA hybridization levels of strain JG1201T with H. alexandrii AM1V30T and H. phototrophica
DFL-43T were 17.5 ± 0.5 and 12.4 ± 0.2 %, respectively (Supplementary table S3). In the current bacterial systematics, a species is defined when DNA–DNA
relatedness is below 70 % (Wayne et al. 1987). Thus,
isolate JG120-1T could be a new species in the genus
Hoeflea.

Conclusions
The present data demonstrated that the novel isolate,
designated strain JG120-1T is closely related with the
genus Hoeflea. The phylogenetic trees of 16S rRNA
gene sequences generated by neighbor–joining and
minimum evolution algorithms showed that the isolate
was differentiated form other genera (Phyllobacterium, Aminobacter, Aquamicrobium, Defluvibacter and
Mesorhizobium) of the family Phyllobacteriaceae and
that the strain formed a robust cluster within the genus
Hoeflea (Fig. 2). Despite the relatively high 16S RNA
gene sequence similarity of strain JG120-1T with the
most closely related species H. alexandrii AM1V30T
(98.9 %) and H. phototrophica DFL-43T (97.9 %), the
level of DNA–DNA relatedness was sufficiently low
(\25 %) to clearly differentiate between the new
strain and the two Hoeflea species. Differential
features in phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics from other type strains of the genus Hoeflea
were also evident. Taken together, strain JG120-1T
should be identified as a novel species, for which we

Cells are Gram-negative, aerobic, slightly halotolerant, oxidase- and catalase-positive, straight or curved
rod-shaped (0.7–0.8 9 2.5 lm), and are motile by
means of a single polar flagellum. Favorable growth
occurs aerobically with the formation of circular
colonies with regular edges within 3 days, with diameters of *2–3 mm. Growth occurs at 15–30 °C (optimum, 25–28 °C) and at pH 6.0–9.0 (optimum, pH 7.5)
and in 0–5 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0.5–1 %). Na? is
not essential for growth. Yeast Extract is required for
growth as growth factor. Arabinose, citrate, fumarate,
maltose, mannitol, mannose, sucrose and yeast extract
are utilized as carbon sources, but acetate, butyrate,
formate, galactose, glucose, glutamate, glycerol, lactate, lactose, lysine, pyruvate, threonine, urea and
xylose are not. Positive for the following enzyme
activities (API ZYM): alkaline phosphatase, esterase
(C4), esterase lipase (C8), leucine arylamidase, valine
arylamidase, crystine arylamidase, a-galactosidase, bgalactosidase, a-glucosidase and b-glucosidase. Negative for the following enzyme activities (API ZYM):
lipase (C14), trypsin, a-chymotrypsin, acid phosphatase, phosphohydrolase, b-glucuronidase, N-acetyl-bglucosaminidase, a-mannosidase and a-fucosidase.
Does not produce bacteriochlorophyll a or photopigments. Susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,
erythromycin, gentamicin, penicillin G, streptomycin,
tetracycline and kanamycin. Q-10 was detected as the
major respiratory quinone. The major cellular fatty
acids of JG120-1T are summed feature 8 (C18:1 x7c and/
or C18:1 x6c). Polar lipids include PG, PE, SQDG, PC
and PME. DNA G?C content is 57.8 mol % (as
determined by real-time PCR).
The type strain, JG120-1T (= KCTC 23107T =
JCM 16715T), was isolated from the marine sediment
of the East Sea, Korea.

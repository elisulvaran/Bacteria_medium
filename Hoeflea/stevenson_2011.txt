The heterotrophic, epiphytic, symbiotic bacterial strain WH2KT was previously isolated from a
two-member culture in which it was attached to the heterocysts of a strain of Anabaena
(SSM-00). Analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence demonstrated that the symbiont was most
closely related to the type strain of Hoeflea marina (96.9 % similarity), which belongs to the family
Phyllobacteriaceae within the order Rhizobiales of the class Alphaproteobacteria. A polyphasic
taxonomic study was performed on strain WH2KT, which consisted of irregular rods (2–5 mm
long, 0.2 mm wide) that appeared to be narrower at one pole. Optimal growth was obtained in
complex media with 15 g sea salts l”1, at 18–34 6C (30 6C optimum) and at pH 6.0–8.0
(optimum pH 6.5). Unknown growth requirements were provided by small amounts of yeast
extract but not by standard vitamin and trace metal solutions. Of the substrates tested, WH2KT
was able to utilize only acetate, pyruvate, malate and fumarate. Growth was observed only under
aerobic and microaerobic conditions, and nitrate was not reduced. No photosynthetic pigments
were detected under any of the growth conditions tested. The predominant fatty acids were a
summed feature that comprises C18 : 1v7c, C18 : 1v9t, C18 : 1v12t or any combination of these
(64.0 %) and an unidentified fatty acid of equivalent chain length 17.603 (13.5 %). The polar lipid
profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine,
phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphoglycolipid, unknown lipids
and an unidentified aminolipid. The only respiratory ubiquinone detected was Q-10. The DNA
G+C content of the strain was 58.1 mol%. The organism can form a site-specific attached
symbiotic relationship with a species of Anabaena. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic
evidence, it is proposed that strain WH2KT be classified within a novel species of the genus
Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea anabaenae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WH2KT
(5CCUG 56626T 5NRRL B-59520T).

In aquatic environments, synergistic interactions between
heterotrophic bacteria and photosynthetic phytoplankton
or cyanobacteria are commonplace and are important in
global primary production and nutrient cycling (Ashen &
Goff, 1998, 2000; Ferrier et al., 2002; Grossart et al., 2006;
Paerl & Pinckney, 1996). Some of these associations are

believed to be symbiotic and highly specific (Caldwell &
Caldwell, 1978a, b; Ferrier et al., 2002; Jasti et al., 2005;
Lupton & Marshall, 1981; Paerl, 1978; Paerl & Kellar,
1978). One of the more interesting symbioses occurs
between heterotrophic bacteria and filamentous, heterocystous cyanobacteria such as Anabaena, Aphanizomenon
and Nostoc, in which the heterotrophic bacteria are
attached specifically to the heterocystous cells (Fig. 1a)
(Lupton & Marshall, 1981; Paerl, 1977; Paerl & Gallucci,
1985; Stevenson & Waterbury, 2006). In these symbioses,
the cyanobacterium provides a ready source of fixed
carbon and nitrogen (Behrens et al., 2008; Paerl, 1984), a
surface for attachment and a vehicle for spatial localization

characterize the physiology and phylogeny of this strain
and compare it with its close relatives. Based on this
polyphasic study, incorporating phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic methods, it is proposed that strain
WH2KT represents a novel species of Hoeflea.
Strain WH2KT was isolated under heterotrophic conditions in marine purity (MP) liquid medium from a culture
in which it was attached almost exclusively to Anabaena
heterocysts (Stevenson & Waterbury, 2006). Cells of isolate
WH2KT were irregular, club-shaped rods, 2–5 mm long and
0.2 mm wide (Fig. 1b), and able to form star-shaped
aggregates (Fig. 1c) like those of the marine Agrobacterium
species later reclassified as Hoeflea marina (Ahrens, 1968;
Peix et al., 2005; Rüger & Höfle, 1992). No obvious
motility was observed for WH2KT, which is in contrast to
the rapid motility observed directly for Hoeflea species
reported previously (Biebl et al., 2006; Palacios et al., 2006;
Peix et al., 2005). Transmission electron micrographs of
negatively stained cells of strain WH2KT revealed no visible
flagella (Fig. 1b, c). The bacterium was capable of growth in
liquid or on solid (15 g agar l21) MP medium (Rippka
et al., 1979), full- and half-strength marine broth (Difco)
and marine agar (7.5 g agar l21 added) and liquid or solid PY
medium (20 g sea salts, 3 g peptone and 0.5 g yeast extract
l21; Biebl et al., 2005) under aerobic conditions at 30 uC.
WH2KT formed colonies that were small (1–2 mm), nonpigmented and opaque after 7–10 days on all agar media.

the cell morphology of Hoeflea anabaenae sp. nov. WH2KT attached

in the environment (Jones & Cannon, 1986). The benefit of
this symbiotic relationship, with regard to the Anabaena
strain, is realized by increased rates of growth and nitrogen
fixation in the presence of attached heterotrophic bacteria
(Lupton & Marshall, 1981; Paerl, 1977; Schiefer & Caldwell,
1982).
This study describes a novel isolate, strain WH2KT, that
was recovered as the only heterotroph in a two-membered
culture, where it was attached to the heterocystous cells of a
strain of the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena (SSM00) (Stevenson & Waterbury, 2006). In this paper, we

PY medium was chosen for most of the comparative
studies between WH2KT and other Hoeflea species, as it
supported the best growth of all organisms. The permissible (18–34 uC) and optimal (30 uC) growth temperatures
were determined sequentially in an incubator, with shaking
at 225 r.p.m. with periodic measurement of optical density
at 600 nm (OD600). WH2KT was able to grow at pH 6.0–
8.0; maximal OD600 was achieved in PY medium at pH 6.5.
Sea salts were required at a concentration of at least 5 g l21,
but WH2KT grew optimally at concentrations between 12.5
and 17.5 g l21 and tolerated only up to 25 g sea salts l21.
No growth was observed when NaCl was substituted for sea
salts.
Utilization of carbon sources was determined in experiments modelled after those used for the characterization of
Hoeflea phototrophica, using a minimal seawater medium
containing 20 g sea salts l21 and 0.1 g yeast extract l21 for
required growth factors (Biebl et al., 2006). The following
carbon sources were tested at 1 g l21 (acids as sodium
salts): acetate, pyruvate, fumarate, malate, lactate, glutamate, butyrate, glucose, fructose, sucrose, ethanol, methanol,
glycerol and L-arabinose. An organism was considered able
to utilize a substrate if it resulted in a significant increase in
maximum OD600 compared with controls that contained
only yeast extract (mean value, n54; Student’s t-test,
P,0.05). Substrate utilization profiles were also determined in this manner for H. phototrophica DSM 17068T,
Hoeflea alexandrii DSM 16655T and H. marina DSM
16791T to allow direct comparison (Table 1). WH2KT was

able to utilize acetate, pyruvate, malate and fumarate. The
other Hoeflea type strains were also able to utilize glucose,
fructose, sucrose, glutamate and L-arabinose. In addition,
H. phototrophica DSM 17068T could use butyrate and H.
marina DSM 16791T could use glycerol.
Extracellular enzyme activities were characterized using
the API ZYM kit for strain WH2KT and the other Hoeflea
type strains, which were sampled from cultures in midexponential phase (OD600 0.4–0.5) in 16 PY medium.
Strips were incubated at 30 uC for 24 h prior to reading
the results, which are compared among all strains in
Supplementary Table S1, available in IJSEM Online.
Among the Hoeflea strains, strain WH2KT was unique in
that it possessed trypsin but lacked esterase lipase.
The production of bacteriochlorophyll a and other
photopigments by strain WH2KT was investigated as
described by Biebl et al. (2006). The absorption spectrum
lacked the peaks of bacteriochlorophyll a and a carotenoid
that are found in H. phototrophica. In this regard, strain
WH2KT is like H. alexandrii and H. marina in that it does
not produce photopigments (Palacios et al., 2006).
Long-chain cellular fatty acids, respiratory lipoquinones
and polar lipids were extracted from cell biomass of strain
WH2KT, H. phototrophica DSM 17068T, H. alexandrii
DSM 16655T and H. marina DSM 16791T harvested from
cultures during mid-exponential phase (OD600 0.4–0.5) in
PY broth at 30 uC. Long-chain cellular fatty acids were
analysed by GC (MIDI Sherlock) at the CCUG as described
previously (Kämpfer & Kroppenstedt, 1996). Overall,
strain WH2KT had a fatty acid profile that was similar to
those of the other Hoeflea type strains, but differences were
observed in the presence/absence of several components
(Table 2). Fatty acids detected in strain WH2KT included
C18 : 1v7c/v9t/v12t or any combination of these (64.0 %),
ECL 17.603 (13.5 %), ECL 18.846/C19 : 1v6c (7.5 %),
C18 : 1v9c (6.6 %), C18 : 0 (4.0 %), 11-methyl C18 : 1v7c
(2.6 %) and C16 : 0 (1.8 %). Strain WH2KT was unique
among the Hoeflea strains in that it contained the saturated
fatty acid C18 : 0 and the unsaturated fatty acid C18 : 1v9c,
but lacked C16 : 1v9c. Polar lipid and respiratory quinone

analyses were carried out by the Identification Service of
the DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany, and Dr B. J. Tindall
(DSMZ). Images of TLC polar lipid profiles are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S1 and a comparison of profiles is
given in Supplementary Table S2. Strain WH2KT was
unique among the Hoeflea strains in that it possessed two
unidentified phospholipids and did not contain sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol. All strains produced ubiquinone 10
(Q-10) as their single respiratory lipoquinone, a feature of
the majority of alphaproteobacteria.
The novel isolate WH2KT forms a unique attached
symbiotic relationship with a species of Anabaena (Fig.
1a; Stevenson & Waterbury, 2006). The ability to attach to
the filamentous heterocystous cyanobacterium Anabaena
sp. SSM-00 was compared between WH2KT and the
Hoeflea type strains in a series of attachment experiments.
Cells from WH2KT and each Hoeflea type strain were
harvested from mid-exponential phase cultures growing in
PY medium. Optical densities of culture aliquots were
normalized by dilution with fresh PY medium and cells
were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended
in the nitrogen-free, autotrophic seawater medium KSO
(Stevenson & Waterbury, 2006; Waterbury et al., 1986) and
added to cultures of Anabaena with shaking at 125 r.p.m.
under fluorescent light at 25 uC. Attachment was monitored microscopically on days 3, 7, 14, 30 and 49. The level
of attachment (if observed) was recorded as the number of
attachments per 106 Anabaena filaments (mean two
heterocysts per filament) and the number of cells attached
to each heterocyst. No attachment was observed for

H. marina DSM 16791T or H. alexandrii DSM 16655T. H.
phototrophica DSM 17068T exhibited only rare attachment;
six of 106 (5.7 %) filaments were observed to contain
attachment of cells of H. phototrophica DSM 17068T at
day 49, with only one cell in each case. In contrast, cells
of WH2KT were found attached to 28 % of observed
heterocysts at day 7 and 55 % at day 49, with a mean of
four cells per heterocyst.
The phylogenetic relationship between WH2KT and the
closest related organisms with validly published names
was determined by comparing nearly full-length 16S
rRNA gene sequences from prokMSA of the GreenGenes
database (DeSantis et al., 2006a, b). Using the phylogenetic software package ARB (Ludwig et al., 2004), sequence
alignments were optimized manually based on 16S rRNA
secondary structure and filtered to include only homologous nucleotides for analysis. These optimally aligned
sequences were used in PAUP* 4b to determine phylogenetic relationships based on neighbour-joining, maximumparsimony and maximum-likelihood methods (Fig. 2;
Swofford, 2003). Bootstrap analyses using distance and
maximum-parsimony were based on 1000 resamplings.
Nucleotide pairwise sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA
gene over 1429 homologous nucleotides was calculated in
ARB and using the web-based tool EzTaxon (Chun et al.,
2007).
Strain WH2KT belongs to a cluster of named organisms
that includes H. marina LMG 128T (96.9 % similarity), H.
phototrophica DFL-43T (96.7 % similarity) and H. alexandrii AM1V30T (96.6 % similarity). However, this cluster
also contains many strains isolated from a number of
environmental sources that have yet to be described.

When these sequences are included in phylogenetic
analyses, WH2KT appears to be more closely related to
alphaproteobacteria that have been recovered from
marine tunicates (Biebl et al., 2005; Martı́nez-Garcı́a
et al., 2007), sponges (Sipkema et al., 2009) and coral
(Sekar et al., 2008). A phylogenetic tree containing these
additional sequences is available as Supplementary
Fig. S2. Two of the three described species of the genus
Hoeflea, H. phototrophica and H. alexandrii, have been
isolated from cultures of the marine dinoflagellates
Alexandrium lusitanicum, Prorocentrum lima and Alexandrium minutum (Biebl et al., 2006; Palacios et al., 2006;
Peix et al., 2005). Symbiotic relationships may indeed be a
life history trait shared between WH2KT and its close
relatives.
Characterization of WH2KT and comparisons between this
novel strain and the type strains of the closest named
species, i.e. H. marina, H. phototrophica and H. alexandrii,
are detailed in Table 3. Strain WH2KT has a more limited
repertoire of utilizable carbon substrates than the other
Hoeflea type strains, apparently being able to use only
acetate, pyruvate and intermediates of the tricarboxylic
acid cycle. This trait may be related to the limited diversity
of carbon substrates obtained from its Anabaena host
during attached symbiosis. The attachment of WH2KT cells
to Anabaena sp. SSM-00 is also a distinguishing characteristic. Only H. phototrophica DSM 17068T was observed to
attach to the Anabaena heterocysts, but at a much lower
frequency. Among Hoeflea species, only H. phototrophica
possesses bacteriochlorophyll a and carotenoids, which is
explained by evidence that this trait was obtained by
horizontal gene transfer (Klassen, 2009). The production of
photopigments would therefore not be a trait that defines
the genus Hoeflea.

Cells are small, irregular club-shaped rods, 0.262.0–5.0 mm.
Colonies grown on PY medium are small (1–2 mm
diameter), smooth, flat and opaque with no pigmentation.
Cultures require aerobic growth conditions and concentrations of sea salts above 5 g l21 but below 25 g l21 (optimum

pH 6.0–8.0 (optimum pH 6.5). Acetate, pyruvate, fumarate
and malate are utilized, but glucose, fructose, sucrose,
lactate, glutamate, L-arabinose, butyrate and glycerol are
not. Yeast extract is required for growth. Positive for the

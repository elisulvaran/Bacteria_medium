The photosensor protein Ppr of Rhodocista
centenaria is linked to the chemotaxis signalling
pathway
Sven Kreutel, Andreas Kuhn*, Dorothee Kiefer

Abstract
Background: Rhodocista centenaria is a phototrophic a-proteobacterium exhibiting a phototactic behaviour visible
as colony movement on agar plates directed to red light. As many phototrophic purple bacteria R. centenaria
possesses a soluble photoactive yellow protein (Pyp). It exists as a long fusion protein, designated Ppr, consisting
of three domains, the Pyp domain, a putative bilin binding domain (Bbd) and a histidine kinase domain (Pph). The
Ppr protein is involved in the regulation of polyketide synthesis but it is still unclear, how this is connected to
phototaxis and chemotaxis.
Results: To elucidate the possible role of Ppr and Pph in the chemotactic network we studied the interaction with
chemotactic proteins in vitro as well as in vivo. Matrix-assisted coelution experiments were performed to study the
possible communication of the different putative binding partners. The kinase domain of the Ppr protein was
found to interact with the chemotactic linker protein CheW. The formation of this complex was clearly ATPdependent. Further results indicated that the Pph histidine kinase domain and CheW may form a complex with
the chemotactic kinase CheAY suggesting a role of Ppr in the chemotaxis signalling pathway. In addition, when
Ppr or Pph were expressed in Escherichia coli, the chemotactic response of the cells was dramatically affected.
Conclusions: The Ppr protein of Rhodocista centenaria directly interacts with the chemotactic protein CheW. This
suggests a role of the Ppr protein in the regulation of the chemotactic response in addition to its role in chalcone
synthesis.

Background
Rhodocista centenaria, first described as Rhodospirillum
centenum [1] is a thermotolerant phototrophic purple
bacterium of the a-proteobacteria group isolated from
hot springs in Wyoming 1985. The slightly spiroid or
vibrioid shaped cells are motile by means of a single
long flagellum, their intracellular photosynthetic membranes are lamellar and their in vivo absorption spectra
show features almost indistinguishable from those of
Rhodospirillum rubrum [2]. However, 16S rRNA analysis
elucidated considerable differences between the species,
hence Rhodocista was separated into a new genus [3],
now consisting of three species [4,5]. R. centenaria is
closely related to the plant-associated genus Azospirillum [6]. As virtually all phototrophic organisms,

R. centenaria exhibits a sensory response to light
originally described as “Schreckbewegung” [7]. Engelmann and also Manten [8] found that R. rubrum cells
accumulated in the most intense area of light gradients
between wavelengths 800 and 900 nm. R. centenaria
shows a particularly unique form of macroscopic
phototactic behaviour, first described in 1994 by Gest
and coworkers [9]. On solid media, the phototactic
colonies move towards longwave light and away from
light with wavelengths less than 650 nm [10]. R. centenaria develops lateral flagella in viscous media or on
solidified surfaces. These flagella consist of a distinct
flagellin whose expression is controlled by specific mot
and fli genes [11].
For R. centenaria, a close relationship between chemotaxis and the phototactic response has been found [12].
As seen with many other photosynthetic bacteria, R.
centenaria has multiple chemotaxis operons with

distinct functions [13-15]. The chemotaxis gene cluster
has been well characterized and most of the genes are
similar to those of other Gram negative bacteria like
Escherichia coli. In brief, the histidine kinase CheA is
linked to the chemotactic receptors (MCPs) by the
CheW protein [16]. This trimeric receptor complex controls the phosphorylation level of the response regulator
CheY. Activated CheY (CheY-P) interacts directly with
the motor of the flagella to control swimming direction.
The dephosphorylation of CheY-P occurs spontaneously,
only in enterobacteria this reaction is accelerated by the
phosphatase CheZ. For adaptation, CheB and its antagonist CheR remove or add methyl groups to the receptors, respectively.
In R. centenaria, the two central components of the
chemotactic signal transduction cascade, namely CheA
and CheY, are present as the fusion protein Rc-CheAY
located in the first chemotactic operon [17], a situation
that is also observed in Helicobacter [18]. Whereas the
role of the CheY-domain of the CheAY protein in H.
pylori seems to be a phosphate sink, in R. centenaria,
the function of Rc-CheAY remains still unclear. While
Che proteins are generally involved in chemotactic
responses, they were also shown to affect the phototactic response in R. centenaria as demonstrated by the
analysis of many che mutants [19].
In the last decade, bacterial photoreactive proteins like
phytochromes, previously thought to be a unique feature
in plants, have been identified as photoactive yellow
proteins (Pyp) and have now been extensively studied in
a variety of eubacterial species (for review see [20,21]).
For R. centenaria, a Pyp-like protein, Ppr, was described
in 1999 by Bauer and colleagues [22]. The large fusion
protein Ppr consists of three functional domains, an Nterminal Pyp domain with the cinnamic acid chromophore, the central phytochrome-like bilin attachment
domain Bbd and the C-terminal histidine kinase domain
Pph which autophosphorylates an essential histidine
residue [22]. Although some Pyp proteins have been
crystallized and biophysically characterized in great
detail (reviewed by [21]), no distinct physiological role
could be attested to these unique proteins. A Ppr-deletion mutant lacking amino acid residues 114-750 did
not show any alterations in phototactic behaviour,
instead exhibited a strongly deregulated expression of
the chalcone synthase gene suggesting a regulatory function in the polyketide synthesis [22]. Although there is
no obvious direct involvement of Ppr in the phototactic
or scotophobic reaction, an interaction with the chemotactic signal transduction components is plausible to
regulate general phosphorylation levels or transduce
phosphoryl groups to a yet unknown light-dependent
signal transducing protein. We therefore analysed
whether the Ppr protein and in particular its

Page 2 of 15

phosphorylating kinase domain Pph interacts with the
Rc-Che proteins.

Results
The chemotactic response of E. coli is inhibited by the
expression of Ppr

The chemotactic network in E. coli is very sensitive to
alterations in the expression level and stoichiometry of
the chemotactic proteins Ec-CheW [23,24] and Ec-CheA
[25] as well as the MCP receptors [26,27]. When high
amounts of single proteins of the chemotactic network
are expressed a non-responding chemotactic phenotype
is observed, similar to a che deletion mutant [28]. To
investigate whether the Ppr protein of R. centenaria participates in the chemotactic network, Ppr and, in particular, its histidine kinase domain Pph were
overexpressed in the chemotactic wild-type strain E. coli
MM500. To this end, the plasmids pBAD-Ppr, pBADPph and pBAD-PphH670A encoding the entire photoreceptor Ppr, the C-terminal histidine kinase domain Pph
and the mutant PphH670A protein, respectively
(Figure 1), were used to transform E. coli MM500.
These plasmids carry the cloned genes under the control
of the arabinose-inducible araBAD promoter. First, protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-blue staining. All three Ppr-derived proteins
were expressed in the presence of arabinose (Figure 2A,
even numbered lanes) but not in the presence of fructose (odd numbered lanes). Next, the chemotactic behaviour of the transformed cells was assayed. TB swarm
agar plates, containing either arabinose or fructose were
inoculated with the respective cells, incubated for 6
hours at 37°C and the swarm diameters were compared
(Figure 2B). The chemotactic response of the wild type
strain E. coli MM500 without or with the empty pBAD
vector was clearly visible by the formation of a swarming ring (lower left and central panels). The response
was completely abolished when cells containing the
plasmids pBAD-Ppr or pBAD-Pph were grown in the
presence of arabinose. In these cases no swarm rings
were visible (upper left and central panels). However,
the expression of the mutant protein Pph-H670A where
the histidine residue at position 670 has been substituted with an alanine residue, led to an only intermediate chemotactic response (upper right panel). The
histidine residue at 670 of Pph is a putative phosphorylation site and is located in a H-box region [29]. All
strains were also analyzed on swarm plates containing
0.2% fructose that did not induce the expression of the
Ppr proteins and did not significantly affect the size of
the swarming rings (Figure 2B). As a control, the histidine kinase KdpE from R. centenaria was overexpressed
which did not interfere with the chemotactic swarming
(lower right panel). To rule out that the inhibitory effect

Figure 1 Domain structure of the Ppr photosensor protein of R. centenaria. The Ppr protein consists of a photoactive yellow protein
domain (Pyp; residues 1-135) which carries the blue light absorbing chromophore p-hydroxycinnamic acid, a central bacteriophytochrome bilin
binding domain (residues 136-601) with the red light absorbing biliverdin chromophore, and a histidine kinase domain (Pph; residues 602-884).
The truncated Pph protein consists of the histidine kinase domain (residues 602-884). In the mutant Pph H670A the putative autophosphorylated
histidine residue (H670) is replaced by an alanine.

on chemotaxis is caused by a reduced growth rate due
to the heterologous expression of the Rhodocista proteins, growth curves of induced and non-induced and
empty plasmid control cells were recorded and compared. No differences in growth rates depending on the
presence of arabinose or fructose in the media were
found (data not shown).
To investigate the inhibitory effect of the Ppr protein
on chemotaxis in more detail capillary assays with a
chemotactic chamber [30] were performed. E. coli MM
500 was transformed with pBAD-Pph and pBADPphH670A, respectively. The cells were grown in minimal medium A (MMA) containing 0.2% fructose as a
carbon source, and the heterologous protein expression
was induced by the addition of arabinose when the culture reached an optical density of 0.6. The number of
cells entering a capillary containing the attractant aspartate (1 mM) was determined after 30 min of incubation.
To normalize the chemotactic activity the chemotactic
inhibition (CI) was evaluated by dividing the colony
forming units in the control samples (cfu H2O) by the
colony forming units in the experiment onset (cfu Asp).
Consequently, a high CI value indicates that the chemotactic response is blocked whereas a low CI value
reflects a normal chemotaxis. E. coli cells expressing
Pph showed a nearly complete absence of a chemotactic
response to aspartate after 60 min (Figure 3A, central
white column). The chemotactic inhibition was calculated to 0.73. In contrast, cells grown with 0.2% fructose
(hatched columns) or cells harbouring the pBAD vector
(left columns), showed a CI of approximately 0.35. Corroborating the results with the swarm plates shown in
Figure 2B, the expression of the Pph-H670A mutant

protein lead to an only reduced chemotactic inhibition
of 0.58 and did not reach the wild type CI value. To
check whether the inhibitory effect depends on the
amount of Pph protein, capillary chemotaxis assays with
different induction times were performed (Figure 3B).
At the respective time, the expression of Pph was analysed by SDS-PAGE (inlet). Our results indicate that the
chemotactic inhibition increases with time and depends
on the amount of Pph protein expressed. A similar
effect of Ec-CheW overexpression on chemotaxis has
been observed [26]. The cellular protein level of Pph
was verified in parallel by SDS-PAGE and Westernblot
analysis (data not shown). Taken together, the results
strongly indicate that the Pph interferes with the chemotactic pathway in E. coli.
The Pph protein interacts with Rc-CheW in an ATPdependent manner

To investigate in detail with which components of the
Rc chemotactic pathway Ppr and its C-terminal histidine
kinase domain Pph interact, the binding to Rc-CheW or
Rc-CheA was analyzed. First, purified R. centenaria
CheW (Rc-CheW) containing an N-terminal his-tag and
in vitro translated and radiolabelled Pph protein were
tested for interaction by matrix-assisted coelution. The
Rc-CheW protein as a bait was heterologously expressed
in E. coli C41 and purified by immobilized metal affinity
chromatography (Cu-IMAC). The prey protein Pph was
translated in vitro and labelled with [35S]-L-methionine
(Figure 4A, lanes 1 and 4). To avoid unspecific binding
of Pph to the Cu Sepharose, a buffer containing 50 mM
imidazole was used. In the assay, both the bait and prey
protein were mixed, incubated overnight at 37°C and

Figure 4 Interaction between Pph and the chemotactic protein Rc-CheW. (A) The binding of the histidine kinase domain Pph and CheW
was analyzed in pull-down assays. R. centenaria 6his-Rc-CheW was expressed in E. coli C41 cells and purified. The Pph protein was translated in
vitro in the presence of [35S]-methionine (lane 1 and 4). Rc-CheW was added (50 μg) to the reaction and incubated at 37°C. The sample was
applied to a Cu-Sepharose column and after washing the bound complexes were eluted (lanes 3 and 6). The fractions were analysed by
phosphorimaging. The in vitro translating protein extracts are shown in lanes 1 and 4, the final wash steps in lanes 2 and 5 and the elution
fractions in lanes 3 and 6, respectively. The co-elution rate was calculated and is indicated. The positions of molecular weight markers are
indicated. (B) The binding of the Pph protein and Rc-CheW was analysed in the presence of ATP. The Pph protein was translated and Rc-CheW
was added as described in (A). ATP or apyrase was added to each reaction as indicated and the samples were analysed as described in (A). The
co-elution rate was calculated and is indicated in % as bound Pph protein.

then bound to the Cu Sepharose column. After intensive
washing the bound protein was eluted, separated by
SDS-PAGE and analysed by autoradiography. As shown
in Figure 4A, the Pph protein co-elutes in the elution
fractions containing Rc-CheW (lane 6) whereas no Pph
protein was detected in the elution fraction of the control without Rc-CheW (lane 3). The co-elution rate was
calculated to 13% of the input Pph protein (lane 4). To
address the possible role of ATP in the binding process
of the histidine kinase domain to Rc-CheW, co-elution
experiments in the presence of increasing amounts of
added ATP (0-20 mM) were performed. The data clearly
show that the stepwise addition of ATP increased the
amount of the Rc-CheW-bound Pph up to 24% (Figure
4B). When, for a control, the residual ATP was hydrolyzed by adding apyrase, the binding decreased to 5%. It
should be considered that in all experiments a low ATP
level (2 mM) is required to allow in vitro transcription
and translation. This explains why in the experiment
with apyrase a lower binding was observed than when
no additional ATP was added.
To calculate the dissociation constant (K d ) of the
binding between the histidine kinase domain Pph and
Rc-CheW, resonant mirror spectroscopy experiments
with a biosensor cuvette system were performed. For
these experiments Pph with a C-terminal strep-tag and
an N-terminal his-tag was purified by immobilized
metal affinity chromatography (Cu-IMAC). An

aminosilane cuvette was activated and coated with streptactin. The purified Pph protein was then bound via its
strep-tag to the immobilized streptactin. Increasing concentrations of purified Rc-CheW were added and the
binding was recorded during 30 minutes. The amount
of bound Rc-CheW and the fractional saturations ( p )
were calculated for each experiment and the data were
displayed in a plot against the added Rc-CheW concentration (Figure 5). A hyperbolic binding curve was
revealed and the dissociation constant was calculated to
Kd = 0.13 ± 0.03 μM. Therefore, the binding of the histidine kinase domain Pph to Rc-CheW of R. centenaria
appears to be stronger than the binding between the
histidine kinase Ec-CheA and Ec-CheW that has been
analysed in E. coli [31].
The histidine kinase Pph is present in a complex with RcCheW and Rc-CheAY

Since the chemotactic MCP receptor proteins in E. coli
and Rhodobacter sphaeroides were found in heterooligomeric complexes together with CheW and CheA
[32-34], we investigated whether the Pph protein can
bind to Rc-CheAY in the presence of Rc-CheW. Pulldown experiments with purified Rc-CheW containing
an N-terminal his-tag and in vitro translated and radioactively labelled Pph and Rc-CheAY proteins were performed (Figure 6). The translation reaction with added
Rc-CheW protein was incubated overnight and loaded

Figure 5 Binding of the histidine kinase domain Pph to Rc-CheW. Purified Pph protein was immobilized on an aminosilane cuvette and
increasing amounts of Rc-CheW were added. After 30 minutes of incubation the free protein was removed and the bound Rc-CheW was
calculated. The corresponding Scatchard plot is shown in the inlet.

on an affinity column (Cu Sepharose). Unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing steps and the
specificly bound proteins were eluted by imidazol and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining and autoradiography. The Pph protein as well as Rc-CheAY coeluted together with Rc-CheW (Figure 6, lanes 15). In
addition to the CheAY and Pph protein bands at the
expected positions, smaller bands were detected that
presumably result from incomplete translation of Pph
and Rc-CheAY, respectively. The results indicate that a
complex composed of Rc-CheW, CheAY and the histidine kinase domain Pph may be formed in vitro. When
Rc-CheAY protein was incubated with only Rc-CheW, it
was also found in the elution fraction (lane 12) suggesting that Rc-CheAY itself binds to Rc-CheW. This result
is not unexpected since in E. coli Ec-CheA is also found
attached to Ec-CheW (for a recent review see [35]).
When only the Pph protein was incubated with RcCheW (lane 9), both proteins co-eluted from the Cu
Sepharose column, showing that Pph presumably binds
directly to Rc-CheW. As control experiments, the proteins were analysed in the absence of Rc-CheW (lanes 3
and 6) showing no elution of Pph or Rc-CheAY.

Taken together, the results give preliminary evidence
that the C-terminal histidine kinase domain Pph of the
photosensor protein Ppr assembles in vitro into a trimeric complex of Pph, Rc-CheW and Rc-CheAY.
The oligomeric state of the histidine kinase domain Pph

Sequence alignments of the Pph domain with other bacterial histidine kinases (e.g. EnvZ, KdpD and PhoR)
identifies a predicted dimerization motif in the N-terminal part of Pph. The Pph sequence shows an identity of
27% and a similarity of about 57% compared to the
dimerization domain of EnvZ (Figure 7A). To investigate
whether the Pph protein can form a dimer in vitro, we
performed gel filtration under non-reducing conditions.
Crude soluble extracts of Pph expressing E. coli cells
were separated on a Sephadex G-200 column and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Westernblotting. The Pph protein eluted in fractions 43-46 (Figure 7B). The
molecular weight of the Pph protein complexes was estimated by comparison with standard proteins on the
same column. A majority of the Pph protein eluted at
about 35 kDa (fraction 45) but a substantial amount was
found as dimers at 70 kDa (fraction 43). A higher

Figure 6 Interaction of the Pph-CheW complex with Rc-CheAY. In vitro translated [35S]methionine radiolabelled Pph and Rc-CheAY proteins
were mixed with purified CheW-6his, incubated at 37°C and bound to Cu-Sepharose. After extensive washing the complexes were eluted and
the fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue (A) or by autoradiography (B). The proteins added in each experiment are
depicted by +. The reactions containing the in vitro translated protein in total are shown in lanes 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13. The last washing steps are
shown in lanes 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14 and the elution fractions in lanes 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15. The positions of molecular weight markers are indicated.

molecular weight form of Pph was found in fraction 22/
23 above the exclusion limit of the column (200 kDa)
and contains most likely higher aggregates which were
also previously observed with Ppr [36,37]. To verify the
oligomeric states, fractions 43-46 were run on a nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Two protein bands with a molecular weight of about 35 and 70 kDa, respectively, were
detected and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. The analysis clearly identified the Ppr photoreceptor (data not shown).
The Pph protein expressed in R. centenaria is found in a
complex with Rc-CheW

To test whether the Pph protein also assembles into a
complex in R. centenaria cells, a plasmid containing an
oxygen regulated puc promoter and an N-terminally histagged and C-terminally strep-tagged histidine kinase
domain gene was constructed. This plasmid was transferred from E. coli RR28 [38] to R. centenaria by conjugation and the protein expression was induced by
anaerobic growth conditions (see Experimental Procedures). The culture was continued at 42°C for 96 h and
the Pph protein was purified using streptactin sepharose.
The elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE,

silver staining (Figure 8A) and Western blotting (Figure
8B). At the expected molecular weight of about 35 kDa
no monomeric Pph protein was detectable (Figure 8A).
In contrast, two bands corresponding to a molecular
weight of about 85 kDa and 60 kDa, respectively, were
found. The 85 kDa band was recognized by an antibody
to the strep-tag epitope (Figure 8B), that is present at
the C-terminus of Pph. The 85 kDa band was also
recognized by the antibody to Rc-CheW (Figure 8C),
suggesting that this band contains a Pph dimer and RcCheW protein. The 60 kDa band represents a non-identified protein that bound to the immobilized Pph. In
conclusion, a stable complex of Pph and CheW can be
isolated from R. centenaria cells confirming our in vitro
findings.

Discussion
Since photosynthetic bacteria have to locate their habitat

The blue light sensitive Ppr protein of R. centenaria consists of three distinct domains, the Pyp domain containing a cinnamic acid chromophore, the phytochrome-like

Figure 7 Oligomeric state of the histidine kinase Pph. (A) Alignment of the dimerization domains of the Pph protein from R. centenaria and
EnvZ from E. coli. The identity was 27% whereas the similarity was calculated with about 57%. The alignment was performed with the Clustal X
software. (B) Purified Pph was analysed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 column. Aliquots of the elution fractions (39-48) were separated by
SDS-PAGE and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. The Pph protein was detected with a conjugate raised against the C-terminal StrepTag II.
The position of the Pph protein is indicated. The following proteins werde used as molecular weight markers: b-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol
dehydrogenase (150 kDa), albumin (66 kDa), carboanhydrase (29 kDa) and cytochrome c (12 kDa) were used.

bilin binding domain and the histidine kinase domain
Pph (Figure 1; [22]). The structural organization suggests
that the protein is involved in a light-dependent signaling
pathway similar to chemotaxis. Since R. centenaria exhibits a strikingly obvious phototactic behavior it is compelling to assume that the Ppr protein is involved in this
reaction. Light with a wavelength of above 650 nm is
attractive, whereas light with less than 650 nm acts as a
repellent [10]. The absorption maximum of a prototypical cinnamic acid chromophore in a Pyp light sensor is at
about 450 nm [40], whereas the phytochrome-linked biliverdin absorbs red light, suggesting that the latter could
function as an attractant sensor. Recently, Cusanovich
and co-workers showed that the holo-Ppr of R. centenaria has absorption maxima at 425 nm (Pyp), 400, 642
and 701 nm (phytochrome) [36] corresponding to the
typical absorption spectrum of Pyp [40] and phytochromes [41]. The phytochromes TaxD1, Cph2 and PlpA
were found to be involved in the phototactic reaction of
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, a finding that supports the

idea of a participation of the Ppr sensor in the phototactic response of R. centenaria [42,43].
The data presented here show that the histidine kinase
Pph domain of the Ppr receptor is found in a complex
with Rc-CheW when isolated from R. centenaria (Figure
8). The interaction of Pph and Rc-CheW was also
observed in vitro with purified components showing a
strong affinity with a KD of about 130 nM (Figure 5). In
contrast to the trimeric Tsr-CheA-CheW complex that is
formed in E. coli with an affinity of about 3 μM [16] we
observed that the complex formation of Pph and RcCheW is clearly ATP-dependent (Figure 4B). It is likely
that the Pph-CheW complex is capable to bind RcCheAY (Figure 6) consistent with the idea that the chemotactic network is functioning in the presence of Pph.
However, the function of the Rc-CheAY fusion protein in
this signaling cascade remains unclear. Preliminary transphosphorylation experiments that we perfomed indicate
that the CheY domain of the Rc-CheAY protein acts as a
phosphate receiver domain and that the CheY domain

expressed in R. centenaria and bound to a streptactin-Sepharose
column. The elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, silver
staining (A) and Western blot with antibodies to strep-tag II (B) or
to Rc-CheW (C), respectively. The crude protein extract (lanes 1 and

acts as a phosphate sink similar as it has been described
for the chemotactic system in Rhizobium meliloti and
Helicobacter pylori [44,45]. The involvement of Ppr in
chemotaxis is also supported from the experiments we

Page 10 of 15

performed with E. coli. The heterologous expression of
Pph has a strong inhibitory effect on chemotaxis as
demonstrated by the swarm assay (Figure 2) and the
capillary assay (Figure 3). Both assays showed that upon
expression of Ppr or Pph the chemotaxis of E. coli is
turned off whereas expression of the R. centenaria histidine kinase KdpE had no effect. This suggests that the
Ppr protein interacts with Ec-CheW although the CheW
proteins of E. coli and R. centenaria show a homology of
only about 59% and an identity of 28% [12]. However, the
structural analysis suggests that all CheW proteins of different species share common features [46,47]. We propose that the binding of the Ppr protein results in a nonfunctional Ec-CheW-Ppr complex that is inhibitory for
chemotaxis (Figures 2 and 3) due to the inactivation of
Ec-CheW. Remarkedly, a mutant of the predicted phosphorylation site of Pph with the histidine at position 670
being changed to an alanine residue had a less inhibitory
effect on chemotaxis, suggesting that the kinase activity
of Pph has a functional role in CheW binding. Similar
inhibitory effects on chemotaxis have been observed for
E. coli when Ec-CheW, Ec-CheA or the MCP-receptors
were overproduced [23,25,27]. In addition, such an inhibitory effect was also observed when chemotactic proteins from other organisms like Rhodobacter capsulatus
[48] or Leptospira interrogans [46] were heterologously
expressed in E. coli.
We found that the histidine kinase domain Pph was
mainly present as a monomer when expressed in E. coli
(Figure 7) and only a minor fraction was found as
dimers. Most other bacterial histidine kinases that have
been investigated so far were found to be homodimers
[49]. Accordingly, when the plasmid encoded Pph protein was isolated from R. centenaria it appeared in a
complex consisting of CheW and most likely a dimer of
Pph (Figure 8).

Conclusions
Working in a network together with the perception of
chemical substrates by the chemotactic signal transduction
cascade, Ppr could very well be a part of a complex sensory machinery to tune metabolic and phototrophic processes in phototrophic bacteria. The perception of light
may only be an oblique indicator for the metabolic state of
a R. centenaria cell as is suggested by its influence on cyst
formation [13,22]. Therefore, Ppr could work in parallel
with the photosynthetic electron transport sensor Ptr of R.
centenaria [50] to specifically regulate cellular motility and
sense the metabolic state of the cell.

Tn10) as described [51]. For expression of Rc-CheW
and Pph, E. coli C41 [52] was used. For genetic transfer
into R. centenaria, E. coli RR28 [38] and in the swarm
assays, E. coli MM500 [53] was used. For E. coli, antibiotics were added at final concentrations of 200 μg/ml
ampicillin, 10-50 μg/ml kanamycin and 5 μg/ml gentamycin and for R. centenaria 5 μg/ml gentamycin, 10 μg/
ml kanamycin. All E. coli strains were cultured in LB
medium at 37°C if not indicated otherwise. R. centenaria
(ATCC 43720) was obtained from the culture collection.
(For anaerobic photosynthetic growth R. centenaria was
cultured in screw cap bottles filled to the top with
PYVS medium [10] and illuminated by an 80 W tungsten bulb (Concentra, Osram, Germany) at 42°C.
Construction of Pph and Che Plasmids

The plasmids used in this study are described in Table
1. The gene fragment coding for the histidine kinase
domain Pph was amplified by PCR using the cloned ppr
gene in pT-Adv as a template (Clontech). The NdeI and
NsiI restriction sites were introduced with the primers
PYP-Nde (5’-CAGCGGCATATGCCGCGCATCTCCTT-3’) and PYP-Nsi (5’-GATCAGGCCCCGATATGCATGGTGACGGT-3’). The resulting ~0.9 kb fragment
was ligated and subcloned in pT7-7 [54] using NdeI and
EcoRI. A spacer sequence (5’-CAGCCGGGCGGTGCAGGCTCAGGCATG-3’) and the StrepTag II

oligonucleotide (ATCCAACTGGTCCCACCCGCAGT
TCGAA AAAATGC-3’) were inserted into the NsiI-site
to give plasmid pSK4. To generate pET16b-Pph the
pSK4 plasmid was cut by NdeI and BamHI and the corresponding ~0.9 kb fragment was ligated into the
pET16b vector (Novagen). Construction of plasmid
pBAD-Pph was performed as follows. pET16b-Pph was
digested by XbaI and HindIII and the resulting fragment
was inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of
pBAD18 [55]. All genetic manipulations were verified by
DNA-sequencing.
A ppr-strep tag II fusion gene was constructed as follows. pET16b containing the entire ppr gene (pNB10),
as well as pET16b-Pph were cut by NcoI and the resulting fragments (~6.0 kb and ~2.5 kb) were ligated. The
orientation of the ppr-insert was checked by DNAsequencing and the resulting plasmid was named
pET16b-Ppr. To construct an arabinose inducible full
length ppr, the gene was excised by XbaI and HindIII
from pET16b-Ppr and ligated into the pBAD18 vector.
The putative phosphorylation site (the histidine at
position 670 in the Ppr protein) was changed to an alanine (CAC®GCG) using site directed mutagenesis with
the primers (5’-CTGGCGAACATGAGCGCGGAGCTGCGGACTCCG-3’) and (5’-CGGAGTCCGCAGCTCCGCGCTCATGTTCGCCAG-3’) and pSK4 as a
template. The resulting mutant was digested by NdeI
and BamHI and subcloned into the pET16b vector generating pET16b-PphH670A. Then the pphH670A
mutant was excised by XbaI and HindIII and the fragment was inserted into the pBAD18 vector to create
pBAD-PphH670A.
To express the histidine kinase domain Pph with an
N-terminal his 10 -tag and a C-terminal strep-tag II in
R. centenaria, the plasmid pZJD11 (kindly provided by
C. Bauer) was used [12]. We used the oxygen regulated
puc promoter and the puhA Shine Dalgarno sequence
from Rhodobacter capsulatus to initiate translation.
Therefore, a PCR reaction with the primers (5’TACGTAGGGCCCTAAGCTAAAGGAGGACTAACATGGGCCATCATCAT-3’) and (5’-TACGTAGGCGCGAATTCGGCTTGATCAGGC-3’) and pET16b-Pph as
a template was conducted. Simultaneously, a SnaBI
restriction site was introduced at the 3’ end of the gene.
The resulting fragment was subcloned into pGEM Teasy vector (Promega) and verified by DNA sequencing.
This plasmid was used as a template to insert the puc
promoter via a second PCR. The primers (5’GGTAACCTTGATCGCCGACACTTGGGCTCCCA
TAGTGGAGCTCGGGCCCTAAG-3’) and (5’-TACGTAGGCGCGAATTCGGCTTGATCA GGC-3’) were
used to introduce a BstEII site at the 5’ end. The resulting fragment was inserted into pGEM T-easy vector.
After sequencing, the pph construct was excised by

Kreutel et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:281
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/281

BstEII and SnaBI and ligated into the corresponding
sites of pZJD11 to generate pSK10.
To express the Rc-CheW protein in E. coli, the cheW
gene was amplified by PCR from the R. centenaria genome using the primers (5’CATATGCATGCCCGCCTGCCCGTTCCC-3’) and (5’GGGAATCGTTCATTGCGATCAGTTTCCGG-3’), respectively. The resulting fragment was first cloned into pT-Adv. Then the cheW
gene was excised by NdeI and EcoRI and ligated into
the corresponding restriction sites of a pT7-7 derivative
containing a decahistidine sequence to create the IPTG
inducible expression vector pT7-7-CheW.
Swarm agar assays

TB swarm agar plates (1% bacto-tryptone, 0.8% NaCl;
0.35% bacto-agar) containing 0.2% arabinose or 0.2%
fructose, respectively, were inoculated with a single colony of E. coli MM500 or MM500 harbouring one of the
plasmids pBAD-Ppr, pBAD-Pph, pBAD-PphH670A,
pBADKdpE and pBAD, respectively. The plates were
incubated for 6 hours at 37°C.
Chemotaxis assay using a chemotactic chamber

2 ml minimal medium A (MMA) [56] containing an
amino acid mixture (threonine, leucine, histidine,
methionine), vitamin B1 (final concentration 10 μg/ml
each), 200 μg/ml ampicillin and 0.2% fructose were
inoculated with an overnight culture of E. coli MM500
or cells harbouring pBAD-Pph, pBAD-PphH670A,
pBAD-KdpE or pBAD18, respectively. When the cultures reached an OD 600 = 0.6 the cells were washed
twice with MMA without sugar and finally either 0.2%
arabinose to induce protein expression or 0.2% fructose
(as a control) were added. The cultures were incubated
for 60 min at 37°C. For the kinetic analysis the incubation times are indicated in Figure 3B. Again, the cells
were washed twice with MMA without carbon source
and were back diluted to an OD600 = 0.6. The chemotactic assays were performed as follows. 300 μl of the
cell suspension were filled in each drilling of the chamber and a capillary containing either 2 μl 1 mM aspartate or 2 μl H 2 O as a control was placed into the
channel between the two cylindrical compartments. The
chamber was incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. The
outside of the capillary was washed extensively with
sterile water and the content of the capillary was blown
out and a dilution series was streaked on agar plates.
After overnight incubation at 37°C the colonies were
counted and the chemotactic inhibition (CI) was calculated as the ratio of colonies of the water containing
capillary to the colonies from the aspartate containing
capillary. Therefore, a low CI indicates an undisturbed
chemotactic response whereas a high CI reflects an inhibition of the E. coli chemotactic system.

Expression and purification of Pph protein from inclusion
bodies

E. coli strain C41 [52] harbouring the plasmid pET16bPph were grown at 37°C in 1 l LB medium containing
200 μg/ml ampicillin. When cells reached the midlogarithmic phase, IPTG was added at a final concentration
of 1 mM and the cells were grown for an additional 4
hours at 37°C. Then the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 100
mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl (buffer W) and
lysed by a French Press. Inclusion bodies were precipitated by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer W
containing 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine. The inclusion
bodies were solubilized overnight at 4°C with gentle
shaking. To the filtered extract 10 mM imidazole was
added and applied to a Sepharose 6b (GE Healthcare)
column precharged with Cu(II) ions. Unbound proteins
were removed by washing the column with 15 column
volumes of buffer W containing 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine and 10 mM imidazole. The bound protein was
eluted by a linear gradient up to 500 mM imidazole in
buffer W + 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine. The Pph protein
containing fractions were pooled, diluted 1:40 with
buffer W (final detergent concentration = 0.01%) and
applied to a streptactin-sepharose column (IBA, Göttingen, Germany) to remove contaminating proteins.
After washing the column with five column volumes
buffer W + 0.01% N-lauroylsarcosine, the protein was
eluted with buffer W + 0.01% N-lauroylsarcosine containing 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. The protein was dialyzed
against buffer W + 0.01% N-lauroylsarcosine and the
purity was checked by SDS-PAGE analysis as described
[57]. Protein marker SM0431 and SM0441(Fermentas)
were used.
Expression and purification of Rc-CheW

1 Liter of LB medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin
was inoculated with a freshly transformed single colony
of E. coli C41 harbouring the plasmid pT7-7-CheW.
The cells were grown to a cell density of 2 × 108 cells
per ml at 37°C, then IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. The cells were incubated for an additional 4 hours and harvested by centrifugation. The
pellet was resuspended in TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl pH
7.4, 150 mM NaCl) and lysed by a French Press. Cell
debris was removed by centrifugation and a final concentration of 10 mM imidazole was added. This crude
extract was applied to a Cu(II)-charged Sepharose 6b
column and unbound proteins were washed out with 10
column volumes of TBS + 10 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 10 to 500
mM imidazole and fractions containing Rc-CheW were
dialyzed against TBS-buffer. The homogeneity of the
protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE.

Expression of the Pph protein in R. centenaria

The plasmid pSK10 was transferred to wild type R. centenaria by triparental conjugation using E. coli RR28
[38], the helper plasmid pRK2013 [58] and the filtermating technique as described previously [59]. After
conjugation, about 109 T7 phages were added, and the
mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C to eliminate remaining E. coli cells. Finally, conjugants were
selected on the basis of gentamycin resistance on PYVS
plates containing 5 μg/ml gentamycin under anaerobic
conditions. 2L PYVS media containing 5 μg/ml gentamycin and 10 μg/ml kanamycin (R. centenaria is naturally resistant to kanamycin [12]) was inoculated with a
culture of pSK10 containing R. centenaria cells. The
cells were grown under anaerobic and illuminated conditions for 96 h and harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl (buffer
W) and lysed by a French Press. The cell debris and the
photosynthetic membranes were removed by centrifugation. The cleared extract was applied to a streptactinsepharose column (IBA). The unbound proteins were
removed by extensively washing the column with buffer
W and the bound proteins were eluted with buffer W
containing 2.5 mM desthiobiotin. The success of the
purification was verified by SDS-PAGE, silver staining
and Western blot analysis with the antibodies raised
against the his-tag or the strep-tagII, respectively.
Determination of the dissociation constant of Pph and
Rc-CheW by resonant mirror spectroscopy

The Pph protein was purified from inclusion bodies as
described above and the aminosilane cuvette was activated as described by the manufacturer (Iasys, Biosensors). 200 μl of the purified Pph protein (50 μg/ml) was
added to the activated cuvette and the immobilization
was recorded for 30 minutes. The unbound protein was
removed by extensive washing and increasing amounts
of purified Rc-CheW (see above) were added. After 30
minutes of incubation the free Rc-CheW was washed
out and the amount of bound Rc-CheW was determined
for each experiment. The fractional saturation was p
calculated and depicted against the amount of the added
Rc-CheW concentration. The resulting Scatchard Plot is
illustrated as the inlet of Figure 5.
In vitro transcription and translation

The histidine kinase domain Pph as well as Rc-CheAY
were transcribed in vitro from the plasmids pSK4 and
pET28-CheAY, respectively, using a T7 transcription kit
(Fermentas) according to the manufacturers manual.
The translation reaction was performed as described
previously [60] by using an E. coli based cell free expression system The proteins were labeled with 10 μCi of

Page 13 of 15

[ 35 S]methionine (ICN) in each experiment. The high
speed supernatant (S-135) was prepared as described
from E. coli MRE600 [61].
Pull-down assays

50 μg of the purified his6-Rc-CheW protein was mixed
with 25 μl of the in vitro translated Pph protein and 25
μl Rc-CheAY when indicated. The protein mixture was
incubated overnight at 37°C. Then, the his6-Rc-CheW
protein was bound to a column containing 50 μl
Sepharose 6b (GE Healthcare) charged with Cu(II) ions
and pre-equilibrated with buffer I (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.7, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole pH 8.0).
After 30 minutes at room temperature, the unbound
proteins were removed by washing the column five
times with 500 μl buffer I followed by an elution with
1.5 ml buffer II (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.7, 200
mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole pH 8.0). All fractions
were TCA precipitated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The
gels were stained with coomassie brilliant blue and the
radiolabeled bands were quantified using a Fuji BAS
1500 phosphorimager.
Gelfiltration assay

1L terrific broth [62] in a Fernbach flask was inoculated
with an overnight culture of E. coli C41 (DE3) harbouring pET16b-Pph. The cells were incubated at 18°C with
gentle shaking for 48 hours. This procedure prevents
the formation of inclusion bodies [36]. Then the cells
were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20
mM Tris pH 7.4, 40 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol. The cells
were lysed by 3 passages through a French Press and
the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The filtered crude protein extract was applied on a Sephadex
G-200 gelfiltration column (GE Healthcare) and separated according to the manufacturer’s manual. The
resulting fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
Western blotting with an antibody to strep tag II (IBA,
Göttingen, Germany).

Abstract
The genera Azospirillum, Skermanella and Rhodocista form a phylogenetic subgroup within the alfa
subclass of Proteobacteria. Based on comparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis a nested set of new
oligonucleotide probes was designed. It comprises probes for the whole genus cluster Azospirillum-Skermanella-Rhodocista, for the Azospirilli subcluster I including A. lipoferum, A. doebereinerae, A. largimobile, A. brasilense and A. halopraeferens, for the Azospirilli subcluster II including A. amazonense,
A. irakense and the genus Skermanella, for the genus Rhodocista as well as for all Azospirilli species or
species cluster. The new probes allow a fast and reliable in situ identification of bacteria belonging to the
Azospirillum-Skermanella-Rhodocista-cluster at different phylogenetic levels. The specificity of the new
probes was tested with 56 strains of the Azospirillum-Rhodocista-Skermanella-cluster and selected reference cells from other genera by hybridising with the complete probe set. In addition, applications of the
fluorescently labelled probes for in situ identification of isolates and for the in situ localisation of
A. brasilense on maize roots were demonstrated using confocal laser scanning microscopy.
Key words: Azospirillum – Rhodocista – Skermanella – fluorescence in situ hybridization – FISH –
16S rRNA – top to bottom approach – identification – monitoring

Introduction
Bacteria belonging to the genus Azospirillum are frequently studied nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria. Azospirilli have
a worldwide distribution and can be isolated from tropical,
subtropical and temperate zones of the world. They occur in
association with roots, stems and leaves of a large variety of
gramineous and non-gramineous plants, e.g. numerous wild
and cultivated grasses and cereals, legumes, vegetables and
fruit trees (BASHAN and HOLGUIN, 1997; GUNARTO et al.,
1999, HAN and NEW, 1998, WEBER at al., 1999).
Azospirilli are in the centre of scientific interest for the
last two decades because under appropriate conditions
members of this genus can enhance plant development and
promote the yield of several agriculturally important crop
plants. The mechanisms by which plant growth promoting
rhizobacteria (PGPR) support the growth of plants have not
been elucidated completely, but several possible modes of

action have been proposed: (1) stimulation of the growth of
the entire root system which results in enhanced mineral
and water uptake (SAUBIDET and BARNEIX, 1998), (2) biological nitrogen fixation which directly contribute nitrogen to
the plant, (3) bacterial production and release of phytohormones including auxins, gibberellins and cytokinins (OKON
and VANDERLEYDEN, 1997) that play an essential role in
plant growth stimulation in general (BASHAN and HOLGUIN,
1997), (4) bacterial nitrite production which increase the
formation of lateral roots (BOTHE et al., 1992), (5) displacement of plant pathogens i. e. fungi and bacteria by antimicrobial activity (RODELAS et al., 1999; SHAH et al., 1992;
BASHAN and HOLGUIN, 1997). The application of Azospirillum inoculants as a “green fertilizer” has been carried out
with considerable success (OKON and LABANDERA-GONZALEZ, 1994).

Besides the development of commercial Azospirillum inoculants, Azospirilli are also under discussion for the industrial production of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate for medical use
(OKON and ITZIGSOHN, 1992), production of vitamins
(RODELAS et al., 1993; DAHM et al., 1993), for the degradation of pollutants (RUSSEL and MUSZYNSKI, 1995), purification of urban residual water and the breakdown of cellulose
in combination with cellulolytic bacteria (BASHAN and HOLGUIN, 1997).
Bacteria of the genus Azospirillum are Gram-negative, nitrogen fixing rods and comprise of 7 species: A. lipoferum,
A. irakense, A. halopraeferens, A. brasilense, A. amazonense, A. largimobile (formerly A. largomobile and Conglomeromonas largomobilis subsp. largomobilis) and the
recently described A. doebereinerae (ECKERT et al., 2001).
Together with the nitrogen-fixing non sulfur, purple phototrophic bacteria Rhodocista centenaria and the non nitrogen-fixing Skermanella parooensis (formerly Conglomeromonas largomobilis susp. parooensis) the genus Azospirillum forms a phylogenetic subgroup within the alfa-subclass of Proteobacteria (Azospirilli subcluster).
For both, the agriculturally and industrial applications of
Azospirillum reliable and rapid identification as well as
monitoring tools are necessary. Several methods for identification have been reported. These include traditional physiological methods (DOEBEREINER, 1995) and serological and
molecular determinations (KIRCHHOF et al., 1997). Most recently, FANCELLI et al. (1998) described the development of
randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers for the detection of Azospirillum strains in soil. Different techniques
are available for direct in situ identification and localisation
of Azospirilli on inoculated roots. ASSMUS et al. (1997) used
fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes and antibodies
in combination with confocal scanning laser microscopy for
the in situ localisation of A. brasilense on wheat roots.
SCHLOTER and HARTMANN (1998) applied strain-specific fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibodies and immunogoldlabelling for the localisation of A. brasilense strains on the
surface and inside wheat roots. Furthermore, reporter genes
like NifA-lacZ (KATUPITIYA et al., 1995), nifH-gusA (VANDE
BROEK et al., 1993) and a bi-functional gfp- and gus A- containing mini-Tn5 transposon (XI et al., 1999) were successfully used to locate A. brasilense on wheat roots. However,

reporter gene constructs are only useful for model inoculation trials and monoclonal antibodies are only available for
certain A. brasilense strains. The described oligonucleotide
probes targeting the 23S (KIRCHHOF and HARTMANN, 1992)
or 16S rRNA (KABIR et al., 1995) are only partly suitable for
whole cell fluorescence in situ hybridizations and some of
these probes are not specific. Therefore it was necessary to
develop a new set of probes with extended applicability.
This study presents a comprehensive set of new 16S
rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes in a nested design for
the secure identification of bacteria belonging to the
Azospirillum-Skermanella-Rhodocista-cluster on different
phylogenetic levels. Fluorescently labelled probes were applied for a rapid identification of isolates and in situ localisation of A. brasilense Cd on maize roots using confocal laser
scanning microscopy.

5.0 D,L-malic acid, 0.50 K2HPO4, 0.20 MgSO4×7 H2O, 1.0 NaCl,
0.02 CaCl2 ×2H2O, 2.0 ml bromothymol blue (0.5% solution in
0.2 M KOH), 4 ml Fe EDTA solution (1.65%), 1.0 ml vitamin solution, 2.0 ml minor element solution, 1.75 g agar, adjusted to
pH 6.8 with KOH. The JNFB-medium is very similar to the NFBmedium, but contains 1.50 K2HPO4, 2.0 agar and is adjusted
to pH 6.0 with KOH (DÖBEREINER, 1995). The vitamin solution
contains per 100ml distilled water: 10 mg biotin, 20 mg
pydridoxol-HCl. The minor element solution contains (g l-1): 0.40
CuSO4×5H2O, 0.12 ZnSO4×7H2O, 1.40 H3BO4, 1.00 Na2MoO4
×2H2O, 1.50 MnSO4 H2O. In addition, half-strength DYGS medium was used, containing per litre: glucose (1.0 g), malate (1.0 g),
yeast extract (2.0 g), peptone (1.5 g), MgSO4×7H2O (0.5 g) L-glutamic acid (1.5 g). The pH was adjusted to 6.0.
Isolation of the Azospirillum isolates from roots
of banana and Miscanthus sinensis
Roots of banana (Musa sp.) were collected in Darbhanga,
Bihar, India and roots of Miscanthus sinensis were from the LBP
(Bayerische Landesanstalt für Bodenkultur und Pflanzenbau),
Freising, Germany. The roots were washed with sterile water and
then crushed in 4% sucrose solution using mortar and pestle.
Small vessels (10 ml volume) containing 5 ml of NFb and JNFb
semisolid nitrogen-free medium (DÖBEREINER, 1995) were inoculated with serial dilutions of crushed roots. After 5 days of incubation at 30 °C one loop of pellicle forming cultures was transferred into fresh semisolid medium. Further purification was
done on NFb and JNFb agar plates, supplemented with 50 mg
yeast extract l–1 as well as on 1/2 DYGS medium agar plates.
Cell fixation
Cells from exponentially growing cultures were fixed with 4%
(w/v) paraformaldehyde as described by AMANN et al. (1995).
Plant growth and inoculation
Zea mays H431 cultivar seeds (provided by CIMMyT, Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maiz y Trigo, Texcoco,
Mexico) were surface sterilized with sixfold diluted household
bleach (Chloramine T, 30%) for 15 min at 20 °C and 3 min in
vacuum. The seeds were washed extensively with sterile distilled
water and allowed to germinate for 3 days in sterile dish plates
with wet paper in the dark at 25 °C. Axenic seedlings with approximately 1cm length were individually and aseptically transferred to cotton plugged glass tubes (200 × 22 mm) containing
sterilized sand (20 g). Tubes were put in a growth chamber with
16h/8 h day/night cycle, at constant temperature of 25 °C for
2 weeks. After 2 weeks the plants reached a height of approx.
10 cm.
For inoculation, a culture of Azospirillum brasilense Cd was
grown in 1/2 DYGS liquid medium at 30o C in a rotary shaker to
an optical density (OD590) of 1.0. The cells were washed with a
sterile NaCl solution (0.85%) and diluted to about 107 cfu/ml in
sterile NaCl solution. The seedlings were carefully removed
from the tubes with sand and the roots were placed into the bacterial cell suspension. After incubation for 2, 4, 6, or 8 hours at
room temperature, the seedlings were rinsed by dipping them
twice into sterile distilled water. The remaining water was removed from the roots by putting the roots on a sterile adsorbent
towel. Afterwards, the roots were immediately cut into pieces
and fixed for FISH.
Preparation of the root samples for FISH
14 days after inoculation, seedlings were carefully removed
from the tubes and the roots were washed in sterile PBS. Root
pieces (10 to 30 mm in length) were transferred to fixation
buffer (4% paraformaldehyd in PBS) and fixed for at least

1 hour at 4 °C. Samples were washed and dehydrated in 50, 80
and 100% ethanol (3 min each). After being dried, the root
pieces were stored at room temperature.
Probe design, synthesis and labelling
Probe design was performed with the PROBE DESIGN tool
of the software package ARB (STRUNK and LUDWIG, 1997).
Oligonucleotide probes labeled at the 5`-end with the fluorescent dyes Cy3, Cy5 and FLUOS were purchased from INTERACTIVA (Ulm, Germany). Probe sequences and target sites for
the probes used in this study are given in Table 2.
Hybridizations
Hybridizations were performed on glass slides with six wells
for independent positioning of the samples. Aliquots of fixed reference cells were spotted on single wells, air dried and dehydrated
by passing them through an ethanol series (50, 80 and 96%, v/v)
for 3 min each. Whole cell hybridizations were performed for at
least 1.5 hours at 46 °C in 10 µl of a hybridization buffer containing 0.9 M sodium chloride, 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),
10 mM TRIS/HCl (pH 8.0), the specific amount of formamide
(Table 1) and 5 ng of fluorescently labelled probe for each well of
the slide. Washing was achieved by immediate rinsing with 1 ml
pre-warmed washing buffer followed by a 20 minute immersion
in washing buffer at 48 °C as previously reported by NEEF et al.
(1998). The washing buffer contained 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0),
0.01% SDS and depending on the hybridization stringency, between 0.056 M and 0.9 M NaCl. Slides were shortly rinsed with
deionized water to remove salts. After air drying, the slides were
mounted with Citifluor anti bleaching agent AF1 (Citifluor Ltd.,
Canterbury, UK). For some probe combinations no simultaneous
hybridization was possible due to different stringencies. In these
cases, the hybridization and washing was started using the probe
with the higher thermal stability followed by hybridization and
washing of the probe requiring lower stringency.
For the hybridization of root pieces the protocol was slightly
modified. Root samples were fixed on a microscopic slide and
covered with 30 µl hybridization buffer and 15 pmol of each
probe. After hybridization at 46 °C for 3 h or over night the
root pieces were transferred into the washing buffer for 20 min,
dipped in sterile water, air dried and mounted on a microscopic
slide in Citifluor.
Probe evaluation
In situ hybridization conditions for the new oligonucleotide
probes were optimised by gradually increasing the formamide
concentration in the hybridization buffer as previously described
(AMANN et al., 1996). The formamide concentrations recommended as optimal in Table 1 are the highest concentrations that
still yield good signals with the target cells and additionally
allow the discrimination of non-target cells.
DAPI staining
For counterstaining with the DNA-binding dye DAPI
(Boehringer, Mannheim) root pieces were covered with 30 µl
DAPI solution (1 µg/ml in PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the dark. After washing the samples with destilled water and air drying, the roots were mounted in Citifluor.
Microscopy
Epifluorescence microscopy was performed with an Axioplan
microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with filter
sets 01, 09 and 15. For the documentation of the hybridization
results the confocal laser scanning microscope Zeiss LSM 510
(Jena, Germany) was used. An argon ion and a helium neon laser
supplied excitation wavelengths of 488, 543, and 633 nm suitable
for FLUOS, Cy3, and Cy5, respectively. A water-immersion lens

with a magnification of ×63 was used. Image processing and analysis were performed with the standard software package provided
by Zeiss. The data were converted to a postscript file with the
software package Corel Draw (Version 5.0, Corel Corp., USA).
Tree construction
Phylogenetic analyses were performed by applying distance
matrix (ARB, Felsenstein, Jukes Cantor), maximum parsimony
(ARB, PHYLIP) and maximum likelihood methods (fast
DNAml, MAIDAK et al. 1994). The data sets used for the calculations varied with respect to the reference sequences as well as
the alignment positions included.

Results and Discussion
Phylogeny of the Azospirilli-cluster
The specificity of the new probes for the AzospirillumRhodocista-Skermanella cluster should reflect the phylogeny within this group. To define phylogenetically mean-

ingful groups, it was necessary to calculate a tree including
all 16S rRNA sequences available for the Azospirilli as
basis for the probe design. The tree shown in Fig. 1 is
based on the results of a maximum likelyhood analysis of
31 Azospirilli sequences (>90% complete) and 60 sequences of other α-subclass proteobacteria (>90% complete). Only alignment positions which share common
residues in at least 50% of all available sequences of α-subclass proteobacteria were included for calculations. The
tree topology was evaluated and corrected according to the
results of distance and maximum parsimony analyses
(LUDWIG et al., 1998).
Comparative sequence analysis revealed that the species
of the genus Azospirillum are members of a phylogenetic
subgroup of the α-subclass of Proteobacteria. This azospirilli-cluster also comprises the nitrogen-fixing, non-sulfur
purple phototrophic bacterium Rhodocista centenaria
(FAVINGER et al., 1989) and Skermanella parooensis (formerly Conglomeromonas parooensis subsp. parooensis; LINDSAY

maximum likelihood analysis of 31 Azospirilli sequences (>90% complete) and 60 sequences of other α-subclass proteobacteria

proteobacteria were included for the calculation of this tree. The tree topology was evaluated and corrected according to the results
of distance and maximum parsimony analysis. Multifurcations indicate branches for which a relative order of the branching cannot
unambiguously be determined or a common order is not supported applying different treeing methods. For the sake of clarity, only a
selection of the reference sequences is shown. The bar indicates 10% estimated base changes.
The tree shows a summary of the newly developed 16S rRNA targeted olignucleotide probes for the Azospirillum-SkermanellaRhodocista-cluster and the two already described probes Adoeb94 and Adoeb587 (ECKERT et al. 2001). The specificity of the probes
is displayed with brackets.

and STACKEBRANDT, 1999) which is unable to fix nitrogen
under anaerob conditions (DEKHIL et al., 1997).
Three subclusters could be distinguished within the
Azospirilli-cluster (Fig. 1): The first group comprises
A. lipoferum, A. largimobile, A. doebereinerae, A. brasilense
and A. halopraeferens (subcluster I). A. halopraeferens
branches on a separate line within this group. The second
cluster (subcluster II) is more heterogeneous as it contains
A. irakense, A. amazonense and the phototroph Rhodocista
centenaria. The third lineage is represented by Skermanella
parooensis (subcluster III). It has to be noted that the position of this species within the azospirilli-cluster could not be
determined unambiguously applying alternative treeing
methods. Performing a neighbour joining analysis Skermanella parooensis clusters with the first Azospirilli-subgroup as described by DEKHILL et al. (1997). However, applying a maximum likelyhood analysis, Skermanella parooensis clusters together with A. amazonense, A. irakense
and R. centenaria. With a maximum parsimony analysis it
clusters on a very short branch outside the Azospirilli lineage. Consequently, as a compromise a consensus tree was
used and the inconsistency or uncertainty was visualized by
multifurication (LUDWIG et al. 1998). In the consensus tree
S. parooensis represents a separate branch within the
Azospirilli-cluster. This was supported by the fact, that S. parooensis – as the only member of this cluster – is unable to
fix nitrogen and to form scarlet coloration of colonies on
Congo red containing medium (DEKHIL et al., 1997).

Re-evaluation of previously published
oligonucleotide probes
The 16S and 23S rRNA databases as well as the number
of species known were considerably enlarged during the last
years. As a consequence, probes described on a more limited
dataset, no longer show the desired specificity (AMANN et al.,
1996). Therefore, it is necessary to regularly check the specificity of oligonucleotide probes.
KABIR et al. (1995) described three probes for the identification of Azospirillum strains by radioactive colony hybridization. A recent database check using the Probe Match
tool of the software package ARB (STRUNK and LUDWIG,
1997) revealed that these probes are no longer species specific. Probe Aba, for example, once designed to detect
A. brasilense and A. amazonense is also 100% complementary to Magnetospirillum gryphiswalde, Leptonema illini,
Clostridium celluolosi, Methanococcus aeolicus and the recently described A. doebereinerae. In addition, probe Al
originally targeted to the 16S rRNA of A. lipoferum, is not
species-specific, because – according to the current sequence
data – this probe is also complementary to the respective
target sites of Ricketsia akari and Sphingomonas adhaesiva.
The probe Ai, originally designed for the specific detection of A. irakense (KABIR et al., 1995), shows identical target regions within the 16S rRNA of more than 20 other
species from different phyla. According to current sequence
data all three probes are complementary to members of phylogenetically not coherent groups and therefore they are not
phylogenetically meaningful. Therefore, it cannot be recommended to use these probes for identification purposes.

89

Besides the 16S rRNA directed probes, several probes targeting the 23S rRNA of Azospirilli were described (KIRCHHOF
and HARTMANN, 1992), such as the genus-specific probe
AZO23S, the species-specific probes AA for A. amazonense,
AB for A. brasilense, AH for A. halopraeferens, AL for
A. lipoferum, AI for A. irakense. A database check with
about 550 published and unpublished complete and partial
23S rRNA sequences confirmed for the species-specific
probes, that all non target organisms have at least two mismatches to the target organisms and therefore can be discriminated during hybridizations. Since the number of 23S rRNA
sequences available from databases is still very limited the
PROBE MATCH can only be a hint for the specificity and the
real specificity of these probes has to be checked performing
extensively hybridization experiments with both phylogenetically closely related and also distinct reference bacteria (STOFFELS et al., 1998). The specificity of the probes described by
KIRCHHOF and HARTMANN (1992) were only tested with a
very limited set of reference organisms and therefore further
experiments would be necessary. The genus specific probe
AZO23S is a mixture of four sequence variations and has
only one weak mismatch with some non target organisms
e. g. Rhodobacter capsulatus and Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Therefore, this probe cannot be recommended for the
identification of the genus Azospirillum anymore. Furthermore, up to now the in situ accessibility of the 23S rRNA targeted probes was only shown for probe AB by ASSMUS et al.
(1995). However, he also mentioned that the signal intensity
of this probe is low and therefore only a limited application
of this probe in environmental samples is possible.
Recently ECKERT et al. (2001) published two probes for
the specific detection of a new Azospirillum species, A. doebereinerae, by FISH. Both probes are targeted to the 16S
rRNA and a database check revealed that they show the desired specificity.

Design of new oligonucleotide probes and
evaluation of specific hybridization conditions
Probe design and specificity analysis were performed by
using an ARB sequence database containing a total of about
10.000 complete and partial 16S rRNA sequences and the
ARB-tools PROBE DESIGN and PROBE MATCH. All probe
sequences, target positions, hybridization conditions and
specificities are given in Table 2. An overview of the probes
and their specificities is presented in Figure 1. The specificity
of the probes was tested by whole cell hybridizations with fluorochrome labelled-probes and representative reference organisms (Table 3). Stringency of hybridizations were gradually increased by the addition of deionized formamide in 5% increments. The formamide concentrations recommended as
optimal in Table 2 are the highest that still yield good signals
with the target cells and additionally allow a discrimination of
non target cells. It has to be noted, that some of the probes
also showed specific hybridization signals at lower stringency.
Since the database contains only a selection of bacterial 16S
rRNA sequences (isolates and clones) and our current knowledge of microbial diversity is still very limited, it is advisable
for most of the applications to apply the hybridization conditions as stringent as possible.

Probes for the genera Azospirillum, Skermanella and
Rhodocista (Azospirilli-cluster)
Using the PROBE DESIGN tool of the software package
ARB no diagnostic region which was 100% complementary
to all 16S rRNA sequences of the Azospirilli-cluster and
different for all other species could be found. The 16S rRNA
position 440 to 457 (E. coli numbering, BROSIUS et al., 1981)
was most promising, which was also described by FUCHS et al.
(1998) for its very good accessibility for fluorescently labelled
oligonucleotide probes. The suggested probe AZO440a
matches perfectly with all A. brasilense, A. lipoferum, A.
halopraeferens, S. parooensis and Rhodocista centenaria sequences. The sequences of A. amazonense and some A. irakense strains have one weakly destabilizing G-U mispairing,
whereas the Azospirillum strains Asp1, DSM 4835 and DSM
4834, which belong to the A. irakense cluster (Fig. 1), have
one strongly destabilising C-A mismatch. All non target organisms have at least three mismatches. Consequently, two
probes for the Azospirilli-cluster were constructed. Probe
AZO440a for the detection of most of the Azospirilli strains
and probe AZO440b that differ only in target position 444
for the detection of the strains Asp1, DSM 4835 and DSM
4834. The hybridization conditions for the probe AZO440a
were adjusted in such a way, that Azospirillum strains with
weakly destabilising mismatches should be detected by this

probe, whereas non-target organisms with at least three mismatches should be discriminated. The specificities of the
probes were tested by whole cell hybridization with fluorochrome-labelled probes and representative reference organisms. Both probes AZO440a and AZO440b yielded strong
hybridization signals with the target cells in the presence of up
to 50% formamide in the hybridization buffer followed by a
significant decline of the signal intensity at 55% formamide.
Obviously, stable hybrids between the probes and the target
sequences were no longer formed at higher formamide concentrations. Under stringent hybridization conditions (50%
formamide) the probe AZO440a yielded good signals with all
tested target organisms and, as expected, also with the
Azospirillum irakense and A. amazonense strains which have
one weakly destabilising G-U mispairing in the target region.
Azospirilli strains with one strongly destabilising mismatch
showed detectable but weaker hybridization signals with
probe AZO440a, but strong signals with probe AZO440b.
Therefore, the probes AZO440a and AZO440b should be
used together at a formamide concentration of 50% for a reliable in situ identification of all bacteria belonging to the genera Azospirillum, Skermanella and Rhodocista (Azospirillicluster). Selected non-target bacteria, such as Thermus silvanus, Magnetospirillum magnetotacti and Flavobacterium
mizutaii with representative mismatch constellations showed
no hybridization under stringent hybridization conditions.

M. STOFFELS et al.

Probes for the Azospirilli-subclusters
Probe AZOI-655 was designed for the detection of
A. lipoferum, A. largimobile, A. doebereinerae, A. brasilense
and A. halopraeferens that form a separate subcluster within
the Azospirilli-cluster (Azospirilli-subcluster I). The target
site for the probe is the 16S rRNA position 655 to 672
(E. coli numbering, BROSIUS et al., 1981) that is identical and
specific for all species of this subcluster. The discrimination
of Skermanella parooensis relies on a G-G mismatch at position 659 (E. coli numbering, BROSIUS et al., 1981), whereas
all other non target organisms have at least two mismatches.
Binding of probe AZOI to these bacteria could be prevented
by addition of at least 50% formamide to the hybridization
buffer. The situation was different for the Azospirilli-subcluster II. The probe design tool was not able to identify a
common 16S rRNA sequence specific for A. irakense,
A. amazonense and R. cetenaria. This reflects the phylogenetic heterogeneity of the subcluster II. The Azospirillisubcluster III comprises only the species Skermanella
parooensis.

Probes at species levels
• A. lipoferum, A. largimobile and A. doebereinerae:
These species are very closely related within the Azospirillisubcluster I. Based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis no relative branching order for these three species could unambiguously be determined as reflected by a multifurcation in
the tree (Figure 1). For A. doebereinerae two probes
(Adoeb94 and Adoeb587) that are accessible for in situ hybridizations are available (ECKERT et al., 2001). We developed the probe Alila1113 for the species cluster A. lipoferum-A. largimobile. The probe has only one central C-A
mismatch with the non target sequences of A. brasilense
strains. As described by NEEF et al. (1998) for a probe for
the phylum Planctomyces, this mismatch constellation is insufficient for full discrimination without a competitor able
to capture the 16S rRNA of these organisms. Therefore, we
constructed the competitor Alila1113C to block the probe
binding sites of non-target A. brasilense strains. At a formamide concentration of 35% and an equimolar amount
of Alila1113+C, hybridization signals of A. brasilense cells
were decreased to the low level of autofluorescence, while
the A. lipoferum and A. largimobile target cells still yielded
strong signals. Bacteroides putredinis contains only one
weakly discriminating base change (U-G) at position 9 of
the target region (position 121 in E. coli numbering). Probably, this mismatch cannot be discriminated at the applied
stringency of 35% formamide and Bacteroides putredinis
might also be detected by the probe Alila1113. However,
when this probe is used in a top to bottom approach together with the here described probes AZO440a+b and/or
AZOI, a misidentification is excluded. Cytophaga uliginosa
which has two weakly destabilising mismatches (G-U and
T-G) with the probe target region displayed no fluorescence
signals.
• A. brasilense: The PROBE DESIGN tool suggested the
16S rRNA position 1420 to 1438 as a diagnostic region for a
species-specific probe for A. brasilense. This region is known
to be accessible for in situ hybridization. The A. lipoferum

strains ATCC 29707T, NCIMP 11861 and EBI F have only
one weakly destabilising G-U mismatch at position 5 of the
target region. All other non target organisms have at least 2
mismatches. Therefore, to increase the specificity of the
probe, it should be used together with the competitor
Abras1420C. The competitor is one nucleotide shorter than
the probe Abras1420 and is 100% complementary to the
A. lipoferum strains ATCC 29707T, NCIMP 11861 and EBI
F and to Bartonella spp., Phylobacterium spp., Nanobacterium sp. and Wolbachia melophagi. The combination of
Abras1420 and Abras1420C enables reliable whole cell
identification of A. brasilense with an addition of 45% formamide to the hybridization buffer.
• A. halopraeferens: For the design of specific probes for
the species A. halopraeferens only the sequence of the type
strain was available. After comparative sequence analysis
position 1115-1133 and 1249-1266 of the 16S rRNA of
A. halopraeferens were chosen as target sites for the probes
Ahalo1115 and Ahalo1249. Both regions were suitable for
whole cell hybridization. To discriminate all non-target organisms competitor oligonucleotides were designed. The
competitor Ahalo1249C is complementary to all A. lipoferum strains and to A. largimobile, whereas Ahalo1115C
blocks A. doebereinerae. For good signal strength and specific hybridization conditions, probe Ahalo1249 should be
used together with the competitor at 60% formamide. Probe
Ahalo1115 and the competitor Ahalo1115C show the desired specificity at a formamide concentration of 45%, but
the sensitivity for this probe was significantly lower than for
the probe Ahalo1249. This is certainly a disadvantage for
the application in environmental samples. In situ hybridizations with five different A. halopraeferens strains revealed
that both probes are species-specific (Table 3). Obviously,
the tested A. halopraeferens strains comprise a homogenous
set of strains.
• A. amazonense: The probe Aama1250 was developed
for the specific detection of A. amazonense. It is targeted to
the same 16S rRNA as the probe Ahalo1249 and it also
yielded bright and strong hybridization signals. All non-target bacteria have at least two mismatches to the probe sequence and can be discriminated at the recommended stringency (50% formamide).
• A. irakense-cluster: Probes Airak985 and Airak1423
are complementary to target sites identified to be specific
for the A. irakense-cluster (16S rRNA E. coli positions 9851003 and 1423-1440) by the PROBE DESIGN tool. This
cluster comprises the A. irakense strains KBC1, 103312
and ASP-1 and the Azospirillum sp. strains DSM 4834 and
DSM 4835. Strains DSM 4834 and DSM 4835 were deposited on the basis of their nitrogen fixing ability, morphology and physiological characteristics at the DSMZ as
Azospirillum sp. (XIA et al., 1994). They have an overall
16S sequence similarity of 97.6 and 98.0 with the A. irakense type strain. Up to now it is still questionable, if they
comprise an own species or not. For specific and bright hybridization probe Airak985 and Airak1423 should be used
with 35% and 10% formamide in the hybridization buffer,
respectively.
• Rhodocista centenaria: The genus Rhodocista comprises the species Rhodocista centenaria IAM 14193T and the

Design and Application of New 16S rRNA-targeted Oligonucleotide Probes

two isolates MT-Sp-2 and MT-Sp-3 (KAWASAKI et al., 1992).
It represents nitrogen-fixing, phototrophic bacteria of the
Azospirilli-cluster. For the specific detection of this genus
the probe Rhodo654 was designed. Specific hybridization is
readily achieved at the recommended formamide concentration of 65% (Table 3).
• Skermanella parooensis: To complete the probe set for
the Azospirilli-cluster we also tested several diagnostic 16S
rRNA regions for S. parooensis: Sparo1402, Sparo127,
Sparo66 and Sparo84. Surprisingly, the Cy3-labelled probes
Sparo1402, Sparo127 and Sparo66 yielded no detectable
binding to whole fixed cells of S. parooensis even though the
target sites for these probes were shown to be accessible at
the 16S-rRNA of E.coli for FISH (FUCHS et al., 1998). Only
with probe Sparo84, targeted to a region with a very poor in
situ accessibility in E. coli, bright in situ hybridization signals could be achieved. These results support the conclusions by FUCHS and coworkers (1998) that the accessibility
of probe target sites in other bacteria could be different to
the situation in E. coli. The probe Sparo84 should be used at
20% formamide. At this stringency the sensitivity in whole
cell hybridizations is very good and the specificity was as expected. Since S. parooensis AUS 2042 is the only Skermanella parooensis isolate described until now, more isolates will
be necessary to proof, whether the probe Sparo84 is species
or genus specific.
An interesting observation could be made during the hybridization experiments with Skermanella reference cells.
Skermanella parooensis is described as a bacterium which
exhibits unicellular and multicellular phases of growth.
Unicellular phase cells are rod-shaped, with rounded or tapered ends. Multicellular conglomerates arise from single
cells which lose motility, become optically refractile and reproduce by multiplanar centripetal septation. Under suitable conditions, conglomerates dissociate into single cells
(DEKHIL et al., 1997; SKERMAN et al., 1983). In a paraformaldehyd fixed Skermanella parooense overnight culture both morphotypes could be observed. Interestingly,
the multicellular aggregates yielded strong hybridization
signals with the rRNA targeted, fluorescently labelled
oligonucleotide probes Sparo84 and AZO440a+b whereas
the single cells showed only weak or no fluorescence signals (Fig. 2 C). Obviously, cells from the multicellular
growth phase are physiologically more active, because the
signal intensity of in situ hybridizations correlate with the
cellular rRNA content and growth rates of the target cells
(AMANN et al., 1995). Therefore, conglomerates cannot be
considered as resting stages. An alternative explanation is
that the cell peripheries of the unicellular phase cells are
modified and may hinder the access of oligonucleotides to
their target sites. The conglomerates displayed remarkable
autofluorescence, but its intensity was significantly below
the probe conferred fluorescence.

Specificity and application of the new probes
To test the specificity of the new probes 57 strains
of the Azospirillum-Rhodocista-Skermanella-cluster were
hybridized with the complete probe set. The strain collec-

93

tion (Table 1) comprises a large part of Azospirilli strains
available in different strain collections as well as new isolates. All strains hybridized with the genus-cluster probe
AZO440a+b and, except one (GSF 31), all strains could
be identified with the species or species-cluster probes
(Table 3). All probes showed the desired specificity and no
cross reactions of the species and species-cluster probes
could be observed. The hybridization results fit very well
with the description of the strains based on physiological
and molecular approaches. Only for the strains GSF21,
Azospirillum sp. DSM 1726 and Azospirillum sp. DSM
1727 the results differ. KIRCHHOF et al. (1997) had identified the strain GSF21 by radioactive dot blot hybridization
with the 23S-rRNA targeted probe AL as A. lipoferum.
According to our hybridization results and the previously
published results from ECKERT et al. (2001) this strain
should be grouped to the newly described species A. doebereinerae. The two strains DSM 1727 and DSM 1726
were received from the DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany)
as Azospirillum sp. Comparative 16S rRNA sequence
analysis performed by XIA et al. (1994) revealed that the
two strains were missclassified and did not cluster with the
other Azospirilli. FISH with oligonucleotide probes for the
alfa-, beta- and gamma-subclasses of Proteobacteria
(MANZ et al., 1992) and the new probe set for the Azospirilli-cluster indicates that there is probably a confusion with
the two strains. In our hands, DSM 1727 did not hybridize with the probe GAM42a which is specific for the
gamma-subclass of Proteobacteri. However, it hybridized
with probe ALF1b, which is specific for the alfa-subclass
of Proteobacteria, some members of the delta subclass of
Proteobacteria and most Spirochaetes. A further analysis
revealed that the strain belongs to the alfa subclass of Proteobacteria but not to the Azospirilli-cluster. For the strain
DSM 1726 the situation was more difficult. Obviously, it
is a mixed culture of alfa- and gamma-subclass Proteobacteria. The cells hybridizing with the probe ALF1b also
showed strong hybridization with the probes
AZO440a+b, specific for the genera Azospirillum, Skermanella and Rhodocista, the probe AZOI-655, specific for
the Azospirilli cluster I and the probe Alila-1113. Therefore the cells could be grouped to the A. lipoferum-A.
largomobile-cluster. The cells belonging to the gamma
subclass of Proteobacteria were not further characterised.
To confirm these results we ordered the strains twice from
the DSMZ and obtained the same hybridization results.
An example of single cell differentiation by FISH of different Azospirillum species is given in Fig. 2A. A mixture of
A. lipoferum DSM 1691, A. brasilense DSM 1858 and
A. amazonense DSM 2787 was hybridized with FLUOSlabelled probe Aama1250 specific for A. amazonense, Cy3labelled probe Alila1113 specific for A. lipoferum and
A. doebereinerae and Cy5-labelled probe Abras1420 for the
detection of A. brasilense. FISH could clearly differentiate
between the three species by giving red (A. lipoferum), green
(A. amazonense) or blue fluorescence (A. brasilense) conferred by the probes.
The new probe set is a good tool for the fast and reliable
screening of isolates by whole cell hybridization. We used it
together with the probe ALF1b for the screening of 130 nitro-

DSM 2787. Cells of A. brasilense are stained blue by specific binding of the Cy5-labelled probe Abras1420, A. lipoferum cells are labelled red by specific binding of the Cy3-labelled probe Alila1113 and A. amazonense cells are stained green by specific binding of
the FLUOS-labelled probe Aama1250.
B) Top to bottom approach for the whole cell identification of the nitrogen fixing banana isolate GSFB3. An artificial mixture of the
isolate GSFB3 from banana roots, A. lipoferum DSM 1841 and A. amazonense DSM 2787 was simultaneously hybridized with the
nested probe set AZO440a+b-Cy3, specific for the Azospirillum-Rhodocista-Skermanella-cluster, AZOI-655-FLUOS, specific for the
species cluster A. lipoferum, A. brasilense, A. largimobile and A. halopraefens and the probe Abras1420-Cy5 which is specific for
A. brasilense. Cells of the isolate GSFB3 are detected by all three probes resulting in a white staining of the cells.
C) Whole cell identification of Skermanella parooensis cells with different morphological appearance. The paraformaldehyde fixed
overnight culture was simultaneously hybridized with the Cy3-labelled probe Sparo84, specific for S. parooensis, and the Cy5labelled probe AZO440a+b, specific for the Azospirillum-Skermanella-Rhodocista-cluster. The phase contrast image was superimposed with the two epifluorescence panels by image analysis. The oligonucleotide probes allow the detection of both the unicellular
and multicellular phases of growth.
D) In situ detection of A. brasilense Cd at the root surface of an inoculated wheat seedling, grown in a hydroponic system with quarz
sand. A root sample was fixed and hybridized with the FLUOS-labelled probe EUB338, the Cy3-labelled probe ALF1b and with the
Cy5-labelled probe AZO440a. A. brasilense Cd cells are binding all three probes and yield a white image.

Design and Application of New 16S rRNA-targeted Oligonucleotide Probes

gen fixing isolates from banana roots (results not shown). Performing a top to bottom approach we could identify three isolates (GSFB3, GSFB4 and GSFB43) as A. mazonense. All
other isolates did not belong to the Azospirilli-cluster. Fig. 2B
shows the whole cell hybridization of the isolate GSFB3,
A. lipoferum DSM 1841 and A. amazonense DSM 2787 with
the nested probes AZO440a+b, AZOI655 and Aama1250.
Additionally, four isolates obtained from Miscanthus sinensis
cv. Gigantheus using nitrogen free-semisolid media could be
assigned to the A. lipoferum-A. largmobile cluster by FISH.
An important application of the new probes is the in situ
identification of inoculated or naturally occuring Azospirilli
in the rhizosphere. Root samples of quartz sand-grown
wheat seedings, inoculated with A. brasilense, were hybridized with fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides. For the
in situ detection of A. brasilense a top to bottom approach
was performed using the nested probe set EUB338 (FLUOSlabelled), ALF1b (Cy3-labelled) and the new probe
AZO440a (Cy5-labelled). The hybridization signals were
monitored using confocal laser scanning microscope. Since
A. brasilense cells hybridized with all three probes used, a
white image is acquired, which is easily detectable in the
plant tissue (Fig. 2D).

Conclusion
The newly developed oligonucleotide probes greatly improve the existing probes for the Azospirillum-cluster. They
can be used for whole cell and in situ hybridization of these
bacteria. The nested design of the oligonucleotides enables a
reliable and fast identification of bacteria belonging to the
Azospirillum-Skermanella-Rhodocista-cluster on different
phylogenetic levels.
Bacteria of the genus Azospirillum are important plant
growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and are applied as
inoculants. However, up to now little information is available about the survival, growth and the metabolic activity of
the inoculated bacteria in the environment. The new probe
set will allow to gain more fundamental insights into the fate
and population dynamics of inoculants. On the basis of these
results, beneficial and ecologically competent bacterial
strains can be defined and the inoculation strategies may be
improved. Application of rRNA-targeted probes in combination with probes specific for genes involved in the expression
of phenotypic traits or together with antibodies against surface exposed or cytoplasmatic enzymes could combine phylogenetic identification with functional analysis (LUDWIG
et al., 1998; ASSMUS et al., 1997). Recently LEE et al. (1999)
reported the successful combination of in situ rRNA hybridization techniques, cryosectioning and laser scanning microscopy with microautoradiography. This technique will
also be a promising opportunity for obtaining cultivation independent information about the role of indigenous or inoculated plant growth promoting bacteria in the rhizosphere.

H

yphomicrobium spp. are restricted facultative methylotrophs
that reproduce by budding at the tip of a polar prostheca.
They are ubiquitous in water and soil but can also be found in
sewage treatment plants (1). Some strains have been characterized
by their denitrification capacities (2–5). They have often been
identified as major players in denitrification systems supplemented with methanol (4, 6–8), and their presence has been associated with high denitrification rates (9, 10).
Denitrification takes place in bacterial cells where N-oxides
and/or N-oxyanions serve as the terminal electron acceptor instead of oxygen (O2) for energy production when oxygen depletion occurs, leading to the production of gaseous nitrogen (N2)
(11). Four sequential reactions are essential for the reduction of
nitrate to gaseous nitrogen via nitrite, nitric oxide, and nitrous
oxide intermediates, and each of these reactions is catalyzed by
different enzymes, namely, nitrate reductases (Nar and Nap), nitrite reductase (Nir), nitric oxide reductase (Nor), and nitrous
oxide reductase (Nos) (12–14).
Previous studies using DNA hybridization with probes targeting genes encoding the catalytic subunit of denitrification reductases (narG, nirK, nirS, and nosZ) detected denitrification genes in
several members of the genus Hyphomicrobium, including H.
denitrificans and H. zavarzinii (2, 3). H. denitrificans (5) is commonly found in soils, freshwater environments, and activated
sludge. This bacterium has the capacity to denitrify (2), and its
nitrite and nitrous oxide reductases were previously characterized
(15–18). H. zavarzinii is a soil bacterium that has been studied
mainly for the biotechnological potential of the exceptional formaldehyde dehydrogenase found in strain ZV580 (19, 20). Recently,
we described a new denitrifying species of the genus Hyphomicrobium, H. nitrativorans NL23T (21, 22). This bacterium was isolated

from a methanol-fed denitrification system treating seawater at
the Montreal Biodome in Canada. H. nitrativorans was one of the
most abundant bacterial species in the denitrifying biofilm, along
with Methylophaga nitratireducenticrescens JAM1T, which was also
isolated from this biofilm and which can reduce nitrate into nitrite
(23, 24). Given that pure cultures of H. nitrativorans grow poorly
in seawater (21), we believe that M. nitratireducenticrescens JAM1
and H. nitrativorans NL23 work together in syntrophy in the biofilm to achieve the complete denitrification pathway.
Despite the presence of denitrifying Hyphomicrobium spp. in
many environments or denitrification processes, genetic and
physiological information regarding their denitrification capacities is poorly documented. This could be related to the fact that
Hyphomicrobium spp. can be hard to culture, especially under
denitrifying conditions. In this study, three denitrifying Hyphomi-

Hyphomicrobium spp. are commonly identified as major players in denitrification systems supplied with methanol as a carbon
source. However, denitrifying Hyphomicrobium species are poorly characterized, and very few studies have provided information on the genetic and physiological aspects of denitrification in pure cultures of these bacteria. This is a comparative study of
three denitrifying Hyphomicrobium species, H. denitrificans ATCC 51888, H. zavarzinii ZV622, and a newly described species,
H. nitrativorans NL23, which was isolated from a denitrification system treating seawater. Whole-genome sequence analyses
revealed that although they share numerous orthologous genes, these three species differ greatly in their nitrate reductases, with
gene clusters encoding a periplasmic nitrate reductase (Nap) in H. nitrativorans, a membrane-bound nitrate reductase (Nar) in
H. denitrificans, and one Nap and two Nar enzymes in H. zavarzinii. Concurrently with these differences observed at the genetic
level, important differences in the denitrification capacities of these Hyphomicrobium species were determined. H. nitrativorans
grew and denitrified at higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations than did the two other species, without significant nitrite accumulation. Significant increases in the relative gene expression levels of the nitrate (napA) and nitrite (nirK) reductase genes were
also noted for H. nitrativorans at higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations. Oxygen was also found to be a strong regulator of
denitrification gene expression in both H. nitrativorans and H. zavarzinii, although individual genes responded differently in
these two species. Taken together, the results presented in this study highlight the potential of H. nitrativorans as an efficient
and adaptable bacterium that is able to perform complete denitrification under various conditions.

crobium species, H. nitrativorans, H. denitrificans, and H. zavarzinii, were compared at the genetic and physiological levels. Because
H. nitrativorans was isolated from a marine environment, we focused on the effect of salt on denitrification. Among the major
differences found between their genomes was the type of nitrate
reductase that they encode. Our results showed that H. nitrativorans sustained better denitrifying activity than the other two species and had a better tolerance to higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations. The effect of variations in the nitrate and NaCl
concentrations on the relative expression levels of the nitrate and
nitrite reductase genes was also assessed.

Genome sequence analyses. Hyphomicrobium nitrativorans strain NL23T
(ATCC BAA-2476), Hyphomicrobium denitrificans strain XT (ATCC
51888), and Hyphomicrobium zavarzinii strain ZV622T (ATCC 27496)
were used in this study. The general characteristics of the three bacterial
species are presented in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Publicly
available genome sequences of H. nitrativorans NL23 (GenBank accession
number NC_022997) (22), H. denitrificans ATCC 51888 (GenBank accession number NC_014313) (25), and H. zavarzinii ATCC 27496 (GenBank
accession numbers KB911255 to KB911269 for 15 scaffolds) were retrieved from GenBank, imported into RAST (Rapid Annotation Using
Subsystem Technology) (26) for annotation, and processed in SEED
viewer (27) to identify denitrification gene clusters and associated regulatory genes. Orthologous genes were determined with the “sequence-based
comparison” tool in SEED viewer and refined by hand. Briefly, the deduced amino acid sequences for all the annotated genes of one genome
were compared to those of the other two genomes by BLAST (automated
process in SEED viewer). This comparison was performed three times
with a different genome set as the reference each time. Only genes that
resulted from reciprocal analysis were considered orthologous. The three
genomes were also annotated by the Integrated Microbial Genomes
(IMG) comparative analysis system of the Joint Genome Institute (http:
//img.jgi.doe.gov/) (28). The majority of the differences in annotations
between RAST and IMG were in genes encoding hypothetical proteins
with unknown functions. However, both annotation systems provided
similar results for orthologous genes. The results were derived from RAST
because supplemental options were not available in IMG. A genome comparison of the three species was further performed with MAUVE (29). The
average nucleotide identity (ANI) was determined for each pair of species
(http://enve-omics.ce.gatech.edu/ani/). Deduced amino acid sequences
derived from the napA, narG, nirK, cnorB, and nosZ genes that were retrieved from the genomes of the three Hyphomicrobium species, as well as
sequences of their closest relatives and representative sequences of the
Proteobacteria, were aligned by using ClustalW, and phylogenetic trees
were constructed by using the neighbor-joining algorithm (30) with the
Poisson correction method in MEGA version 6.06 (31).
Bacterial strains and growth conditions. Bacteria were cultured in
modified Hyphomicrobium medium 337a (32) [composition (per liter),
1.3 g KH2PO4, 1.13 g Na2HPO4, 0.5 g (NH4)2SO4, 0.2 g MgSO4·7H2O,
3.09 mg CaCl2·2H2O, 2.0 mg FeSO4·7H2O, 1.0 mg Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.88
mg MnSO4·4H2O, and 10 ␮g CuCl2·2H2O (pH 7.5)] at 30°C. The NaCl
concentrations were variable depending on the assay and are specified
below. When required, nitrate was added to the growth medium as sodium nitrate (NaNO3) at a concentration of 14.3 mM (200 mg NO3-N
liter⫺1, unless otherwise specified). Nitrate was added to the precultures
for all of the assays conducted under denitrifying conditions (unless otherwise specified). Methanol was added to the growth medium as a carbon
source at a concentration of 0.3% (vol/vol) prior to inoculation. Vitamin
B12 was also added at a concentration of 0.1 mg liter⫺1 prior to inoculation
to stimulate bacterial growth on solid medium and in liquid medium to
start cultures from bacterial colonies. The inoculum was made of fresh
aerobic liquid cultures. Bacterial cells were pelleted, dispersed in a 0.85%

NaCl solution, and homogenized prior to inoculation. The initial optical
density of the cultures was adjusted to reach an optical density at 600 nm
(OD600) close to 0.1. In order to assess the capacity of the three Hyphomicrobium species to achieve complete denitrification, the N2O concentrations in the headspace of cultures incubated with and without 10% (vol/
vol) acetylene, an inhibitor of the nitrous oxide reductase, were compared
(33).
Aerobic cultures used for RNA extraction were incubated with constant shaking (250 rpm) in 200-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 30 ml of
growth medium. For cultures under denitrifying conditions, 30 ml of
growth medium supplemented with nitrate was dispensed into 70-ml
serum vials. The vials were sealed with rubber stoppers and metal seals,
flushed for 10 min with N2 to remove oxygen from the headspace, and
autoclaved. Substrate addition, inoculation, and sampling of these vials
were performed through the rubber stopper using a syringe and a needle.
All cultures were incubated in the dark. Bacterial growth was monitored
by spectrophotometry (OD600). The nitrate and nitrite concentrations in
the cultures were determined by ion chromatography using an 850
Professional IC instrument (Metrohm, Herisau, Switzerland) with a
Metrosep A Supp 5 analytical column (250 by 4.0 mm), while N2O was
analyzed by injecting 250 ␮l of the headspace into an Agilent 6890
gas chromatograph equipped with a microelectron capture detector.
RNA extraction. RNA was extracted from 15 to 30 ml of bacterial
culture in the mid-exponential growth phase. Bacterial cells were centrifuged, transferred into 2-ml tubes containing 500 mg of 0.1-mm zirconiasilica beads (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK, USA), and dispersed in
700 ␮l of a solution containing precooled TPM buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl
[pH 7.0], 1.7% [wt/vol] polyvinylpyrrolidone K25, 20 mM MgCl2), 35 ␮l
of 20% SDS, and 500 ␮l of phenol. The samples were flash frozen with
liquid nitrogen and stored at ⫺80°C until RNA extraction was performed.
After thawing, RNA was extracted by bead beating twice with a FastPrep-24 instrument (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA), with the power
set at 6.5 for 45 s. The tubes were then centrifuged at 20,000 ⫻ g for 5 min
at 4°C, and the upper phase was transferred into a new tube. The bead
beating and centrifugation steps were repeated following the addition of
700 ␮l of PBB buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0], 5 mM Na2 EDTA, 1%
[wt/vol] SDS, 6% [vol/vol] water-saturated phenol) to the tubes containing the bacterial cells. Both upper phases were further extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1 [vol/vol/vol]) and chloroformisoamyl alcohol (24:1 [vol/vol]). For each extraction step, centrifugation
was performed at 20,000 ⫻ g for 5 min at 4°C. RNA was recovered by
precipitation with a 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2
volumes of 100% ethanol at ⫺20°C overnight. After centrifugation at
20,000 ⫻ g for 45 min at 4°C, the supernatant was discarded, and the
pellets were washed with 70% ethanol (13,000 ⫻ g for 10 min at 4°C),
dried at room temperature for 15 min, dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate
(DEPC)-treated water, and treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion; Life
Technologies Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada) for 30 min to remove all
contaminating DNA. Finally, RNA extracts were purified by using the
RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Toronto, ON, Canada). RNA integrity was verified by gel
electrophoresis, and RNA quantification was performed by using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Products, Wilmington,
DE, USA). The absence of DNA was confirmed by endpoint PCR analysis
using 16S rRNA gene universal primers.
Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR assays. cDNAs were
generated from RNA by using hexameric primers and the reverse transcription system from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) with 1 ␮g of extracted RNA, according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays were performed with PerfeCTa SYBR green
SuperMix ROX (Quanta; VWR International, Ville Mont-Royal, QC,
Canada). The final volume of all of the reaction mixtures was 20 ␮l, and
the amplification mix was composed of 10 ␮l of PerfeCTa SYBR green
SuperMix, 0.4 ␮l of each primer (40 pmol), 4.2 ␮l of RNA-free water, and
5 ␮l of cDNA (50 ng). All of the reactions were performed with a Corbett

Sequence analyses were performed in RAST. CDSs, coding DNA sequences.

Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time PCR machine (Qiagen). PCR started with an
initial denaturation step for 10 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at
95°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 30 s at 72°C. The fluorescence signal was acquired
at the end of the 72°C step and at the end of a 15-s reading step at 80°C that
was added to the end of each cycle to avoid fluorescence from primer
dimers. Primers were designed with Primer3web version 4.0.0 (34, 35) to
target the napA, narG, nirK, cnorB, and nosZ denitrification genes and the
rpoB and dnaG reference genes of the three Hyphomicrobium species (see
Table S2 in the supplemental material). Each of the primer sets was tested
for specificity and efficiency of amplification by qPCR with serial dilutions
of purified PCR fragments (efficiencies of between 0.92 and 1.05).
Calculations and statistical analyses. Growth and denitrification
rates were obtained by calculating the slope of the linear portion of the
growth and denitrification curves, respectively. Relative gene expression
was calculated according to the ⌬⌬CT method (36). For each calculation,
only one housekeeping gene was used as a control. For each Hyphomicrobium species, the control gene was chosen from among the two genes
tested (rpoB and dnaG) by using RefFinder (http://www.leonxie.com
/referencegene.php), an online tool that allows the selection of the appropriate control gene based on the lowest variability according to geNorm
(37), Normfinder (38), BestKeeper (39), and the comparative ⌬⌬CT
method (40). Statistical analyses were performed with R (version 2.9.0; R
Foundation for Statistical Computing). The effects of nitrate and NaCl
concentrations on growth and denitrification rates were tested by using
factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). Prior to factorial ANOVA, normality was tested by using the “shapiro.test” function. When necessary,
data were log transformed to meet parametric ANOVA assumptions.
ANOVA and post hoc Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) tests
were then carried out by using the “aov” and “TukeyHSD” functions,
respectively. If significant interactions were detected between the two factors, ANOVA was performed on a subset of data that were generated for
each factor. Normality was tested again on each data subset prior to
ANOVA. The statistical significance of the ⌬⌬CT values was tested by
Student’s t test (two tailed, heteroscedastic).

Characteristic

Genome comparison. The general characteristics of the three genomes are presented in Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 1. A total of 1,961
orthologous genes are shared among the three species (Fig. 1),
with 2,150 orthologous genes shared between H. nitrativorans and
H. denitrificans, 2,687 shared between H. nitrativorans and H. zavarzinii, and 2,355 shared between H. denitrificans and H. zavarzinii (Table 2). The number of unique genes (found in one species
but not in the other two) constitutes between 16.3 and 25.7% of
the total genes, with the highest number of unique genes being
found in H. denitrificans (Fig. 1). However, a large number
(⬎75%) of these unique genes are annotated as hypothetical proteins with unknown functions (HP). When the genomes were
compared for the average deduced amino acid sequence identity
between orthologous genes and for the average nucleotide identity
(ANI) between whole-genome sequences, H. nitrativorans and H.
zavarzinii showed a higher level of identity with each other than
with H. denitrificans (Table 2). These results are consistent with
the results of phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequences (21).
Putative unique pathways were found in each species or in two
out of three species (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). A
long cluster of genes associated with photosynthesis is present in
H. zavarzinii, although there is no indication in the literature of
photosynthesis-related activities in this bacterial species. The urea
decomposition pathways differ among the three species. Urea is
degraded into CO2 and NH3 by urease in H. denitrificans and by
urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase in H. zavarzinii. No
urea decomposition pathway was found in H. nitrativorans.
Genes encoding the Na⫹/H⫹ multisubunit antiporter were found
in H. nitrativorans, and NhaA-type and NhaD-type Na⫹/H⫹ antiporter genes were found in the other 2 species. H. nitrativorans
and H. zavarzinii carry genes encoding methylamine dehydrogenase and associated proteins. These genes were not found in H.
denitrificans, which is surprising because this bacterium can utilize
monomethylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine as sole
carbon sources (5). Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated proteins were
found in H. nitrativorans, whereas only CRISPR-associated proteins were found in H. zavarzinii. However, the draft genome
showed an ⬃3,000-bp gap flanking the chromosomal region of
the genome, suggesting a repeated region that could not be assembled properly.
Genes associated with the denitrification pathway. All three
Hyphomicrobium species studied here possess gene clusters encoding the full set of enzymes necessary to achieve complete denitrification, although they differ greatly in their nitrate reductases
(Table 3). The genome of H. nitrativorans contains a gene cluster
encoding the periplasmic nitrate reductase Nap, the genome of H.
denitrificans contains a gene cluster encoding the membrane-

no homology to sequences in the other two species. Percentages of unique
genes that were identified as encoding a HP (hypothetical protein with unknown function) are illustrated. In the shared zones, only genes that resulted
from reciprocal analysis (e.g., H. nitrativorans versus H. denitrificans and H.
denitrificans versus H. nitrativorans) were considered.

contains gene clusters encoding one Nap and two Nar enzymes.
The three species also have a nirK gene encoding the copper-containing nitrite reductase, along with the nirV gene encoding an
accessory protein in H. nitrativorans and H. zavarzinii. Gene clusters encoding the nitric oxide (Nor) and nitrous oxide (Nos) reductases and with similar gene organizations were also detected in
the three genomes. The only exception is norE, which is located
upstream in a direction opposite that of cnorCBQD in H. denitrificans (Table 3). Genes associated with nitrate transport were de-

FIG 1 Venn diagram illustrating the number of orthologs found across the

tected upstream of the nar gene clusters in H. denitrificans and H.
zavarzinii. Two distinct genes encoding NarK transporters, a
NarK1-type symporter and a NarK2-type nitrate/nitrite antiporter, are located upstream of the nar-2 gene cluster in H. zavarzinii. One gene encoding a fused NarK1-NarK2-type transporter
(here named narK12f) (41) is located upstream of the nar-1 gene
cluster in H. zavarzinii and the nar gene cluster in H. denitrificans.
Genes commonly associated with the regulation of denitrification gene expression, such as nnrS and nrrR, were detected in the
three genomes. Most of these genes belong to the CRP (cyclic
AMP receptor protein)/FNR (fumarate and nitrate reductase regulation) family; some of them are located close to the denitrification gene clusters (Table 3). The narXL two-component transcription regulatory system was found in H. denitrificans and H.
zavarzinii. However, it is not located in the vicinity of the denitrification gene clusters in either species.
Phylogenetic analyses were performed on the deduced amino
acid sequences of genes encoding the catalytic subunits of the
different reductases (NapA, NarG, NirK, cNorB, and NosZ)
found in the three Hyphomicrobium species. All these reductases
are phylogenetically related to known denitrification reductases
found in other Alphaproteobacteria, with sequence identities generally above 80%, except for NarG2 and NosZ of H. zavarzinii
(maximum of 69% identity in both cases) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).
Effect of nitrate and NaCl on bacterial growth and denitrification activity. The three Hyphomicrobium species cultivated under aerobic conditions with or without the addition of 14.3 mM
NaNO3 showed similar growth curves. No nitrate reduction or
nitrite production was detected under these conditions (data not
shown). When incubated under denitrifying conditions at the
same nitrate concentration, the three Hyphomicrobium species
had the capacity to grow and to completely eliminate nitrate without nitrite accumulation, although growth was much slower than
that under aerobic conditions (Fig. 2). The addition of acetylene
led to the accumulation of N2O in the headspace of the vials, while
no (H. nitrativorans) or less (H. denitrificans and H. zavarzinii)
N2O accumulation was observed in cultures incubated without

concentrations, and dotted lines indicate nitrite (NOx) concentrations. Assays were performed with an NaCl concentration of 0.5% in the growth medium. The

acetylene (Fig. 3), indicating that the three species can achieve
complete denitrification.
The effect of increasing nitrate concentrations on the growth
and denitrification kinetics of the three Hyphomicrobium species
was assessed under denitrifying conditions, with the NaNO3 concentration ranging from 14.3 to 107 mM (200 to 1,500 mg NO3N/liter) (Fig. 2). H. nitrativorans had the capacity to grow (Fig. 2A)
and denitrify without significant nitrite accumulation (Fig. 2D) at
all of the concentrations of NaNO3 tested, with optimal growth at
71.4 mM NaNO3. In contrast, growth and denitrification by H.

at 107 mM NaNO3 (Fig. 2B, C, E, and F). For H. denitrificans and
H. zavarzinii, optimal growth and denitrification were observed at
42.8 mM NaNO3, although higher levels of nitrite were constantly detected in cultures of H. denitrificans. While these higher
levels of nitrite were transient at initial concentrations of 14.3 and
42.8 mM NaNO3 in H. denitrificans, nitrite accumulation leading
to incomplete denitrification was detected at 71.4 mM NaNO3
(Fig. 2E).

ment, tolerance to increasing NaCl concentrations ranging from 0
to 2% NaCl was assessed under denitrifying conditions for the
three species. Growth of and denitrification by H. nitrativorans
were detected at all of the NaCl concentrations tested, without
nitrite accumulation, although a concentration of 2% led to
slower growth and denitrification (Fig. 4A and D). Increasing
NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 1% led to delayed growth
and denitrification in H. denitrificans (Fig. 4B and E) and slower
growth and denitrification in H. zavarzinii (Fig. 4C and F). A
transient accumulation of nitrite was also observed in H. denitrificans cultures. At 2% NaCl, these two species showed poor or no
growth and no denitrifying activity.
To further evaluate whether the interaction between nitrate
and NaCl could lead to significant differences in growth and
denitrification rates in the three Hyphomicrobium species, we
carried out a factorial experiment using two different concentrations of each of the two factors in question. Growth and denitrification were assessed at 14.3 and 71.4 mM NaNO3 and at 0 and
0.5% NaCl (Table 4). The results showed that the three species
responded differently to variations of nitrate and NaCl levels.
While no significant interactions between the nitrate and NaCl
concentrations were detected for H. nitrativorans and H. denitrificans, significant interactions between these two factors were detected for the growth rate and the denitrification rate in H. zavarzinii (Table 4). Single-factor analysis of the data subsets showed
that growth and denitrification rates in H. zavarzinii were negatively affected by higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations, with the
lowest rates being detected at 71.4 mM NaNO3 and 0.5% NaCl
(Tables 5 and 6). In H. nitrativorans, while nitrate and NaCl had
no significant effect on the growth rate, a significant effect of both
factors on the denitrification rate was detected, with higher values
being observed at higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations (Tables
5 and 6). In contrast, neither of the two factors had a significant
effect on the denitrification rate in H. denitrificans (Table 6), but
the nitrate concentration had a significant effect on the growth
rate, with a considerably lower value at 71.4 mM NaNO3 than at
14.3 mM NaNO3 (Table 5).

DISCUSSION

H. nitrativorans, H. denitrificans, and H. zavarzinii possess genes
encoding the full set of enzymes required to perform complete
denitrification, and they were able to achieve this process. Under
the culture conditions tested, H. nitrativorans was found to be the
most efficient of the three Hyphomicrobium species evaluated.
Compared to the two other species, it has the capacity to denitrify

intervals, the nitrous oxide concentration in the headspace was measured.

Effect of nitrate, NaCl, and oxygen on relative gene expression levels of the nitrate and nitrite reductase genes. Our results
showed the influence of nitrate and NaCl on the growth and denitrification of the three Hyphomicrobium species. The effects of
these parameters were also assessed at the nitrate and nitrite reductase gene expression levels. We focused our analysis on these
genes because the three species differ greatly in their nitrate reductases; H. denitrificans also harbors a very distinct nitrite reductase,
while NO and N2O reductases found in the three species are more
similar.
The three Hyphomicrobium species were cultured under the
following denitrifying conditions: (i) 14.3 mM NaNO3 and 0%
NaCl, (ii) 71.4 mM NaNO3 and 0% NaCl, (iii) 14.3 mM NaNO3
and 0.5% NaCl, and (iv) 71.4 mM NaNO3 and 0.5% NaCl. Relative expression levels of the napA, narG, and nirK genes were measured during the mid-exponential growth phase, with cultures
grown in 14.3 mM NaNO3 and 0% NaCl as the reference culture
(Fig. 5A to C). In H. nitrativorans, higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations led to a small (1.4- to 3.4-fold) but significant increase
in the relative gene expression levels of napA and nirK (Fig. 5A). In
H. denitrificans, a significant effect was observed exclusively for
relative gene expression levels of nirK in cultures grown with 71.4
mM NaNO3 and 0% NaCl (5.8-fold increase) (Fig. 5B). In H.
zavarzinii, the nitrate and NaCl concentrations affected the three
nitrate reductase genes to different degrees. The relative gene expression level of napA did not change under any of the conditions
tested. Both factors had a negative effect on narG1 gene expression
but a positive effect on narG2 gene expression (Fig. 5C). Similar to
narG1, the relative gene expression level of nirK in H. zavarzinii
was negatively affected by higher nitrate and NaCl concentrations.
Oxygen is also known to have a major effect on denitrification
and the denitrification reductases. The three Hyphomicrobium
species were cultured under aerobic conditions, under aerobic
conditions with 14.3 mM NaNO3, or under denitrifying conditions with 14.3 mM NaNO3. The relative expression levels of the
napA, narG, and nirK genes were measured as described above,
with the culture grown aerobic conditions set as the reference
culture (Fig. 5D and E). In H. nitrativorans, the addition of nitrate
to aerobic cultures led to small but significant increases in the
relative gene expression levels of napA and nirK (1.8- and 3.2-fold,
respectively), while incubation under denitrifying conditions led
to much higher relative gene expression levels for both genes (7.1and 35.1-fold, respectively) (Fig. 5D). In H. denitrificans, the only
difference observed was for the relative gene expression level of
narG, which was significantly higher in the presence of nitrate
under aerobic conditions (Fig. 5E). In H. zavarzinii, none of the
genes tested was significantly affected by the addition of nitrate to
aerobic cultures (Fig. 5F). However, the incubation of this bacterial species under denitrifying conditions led to a strong increase
in the relative gene expression level of narG1 (36.4-fold), a slight
but significant increase in the level of narG2 (1.8-fold), and a
significant decrease in the level of napA (⫺8.3-fold) (Fig. 5F).

at high nitrate concentrations, without nitrite accumulation.
Consistent with this observation, an increase in the nitrate concentration in the growth medium induced significant increases in
narG and nirK relative gene expression levels in H. nitrativorans.
In contrast, an increase of the initial nitrate concentration in the
growth medium led to nitrite accumulation in H. denitrificans

donors. These results suggest that in H. denitrificans, the nitrate
reductase might have a higher affinity for electrons than the nitrite
reductase. H. denitrificans is characterized by its unique nitrite re-

ophaga nitratireducenticrescens JAM1, which can tolerate NaCl
concentrations of up to 8% (24). We hypothesize that H. nitrativorans benefits from the osmoprotection of other bacteria, such as
M. nitratireducenticrescens JAM1, to thrive in the artificial seawater of the Biodome aquarium (NaCl concentration of 2.4%). This
hypothesis is currently being studied in our laboratory.
The detailed comparison of the H. nitrativorans, H. denitrificans, and H. zavarzinii genomes has highlighted the facts that a
large number of orthologous genes are shared among these three
species and that very few genes with known functions are unique
to a single species. From this perspective, the fact that the three
species differ greatly in their nitrate reductases is noteworthy, and
it can be hypothesized that the differences observed in their denitrification capacities reflect these variations observed at the genetic level. Indeed, while H. nitrativorans and H. denitrificans are
characterized by the presence of a single Nap or Nar gene cluster,
respectively, one Nap and two Nar gene clusters have been identified in the genome of H. zavarzinii. Such an occurrence of multiple operons encoding nitrate reductases has previously been
reported for other microorganisms. One well-characterized example is E. coli K-12, which also expresses two different cytoplasmic membrane nitrate reductases (NRA and NRZ), encoded by
narGHJI and narZYWV, respectively, and one periplasmic nitrate
reductase, encoded by napFDAGHBC (48–50). Gene deletions in
E. coli K-12 indicate that Nap can support anaerobic growth when
it is the only nitrate reductase available, although NRA is clearly
the main enzyme responsible for nitrate reduction when all enzymes are present (48).
While Nap in E. coli is expressed under anaerobic conditions
(50) and is specifically involved in nitrate reduction at low nitrate
concentrations (48, 51), different functions have been proposed
for the Nap system in other bacteria. In Paracoccus spp., in which
both the Nar and Nap systems are present, Nar is expressed under
anaerobic conditions, while Nap is expressed during aerobic

ductase, which is clearly distinct from the nitrite reductases found
in other Hyphomicrobium species. It is characterized by the presence of two type I Cu sites, as opposed to the single type I Cu site
found in the nitrite reductases of most bacteria (16, 17, 45). The
role of this second type I Cu site has not been elucidated yet.
Currently, the role of this distinct nitrite reductase in the denitrifying capacity of H. denitrificans is unknown, but it might be
linked to the nitrite accumulation observed in H. denitrificans cultures. Growth of H. denitrificans and H. zavarzinii was totally inhibited at the highest nitrate concentration tested. Because nitrate
was supplied as NaNO3, it is possible that this growth inhibition
was exacerbated by the input of sodium in the growth medium, as
previously observed for Shewanella oneidensis cultures (46).
As expected, H. nitrativorans also demonstrated better tolerance to NaCl than the two other Hyphomicrobium species tested
and showed small but significant increases in the napA and nirK
relative gene expression levels when NaCl was added to the growth
medium. More surprisingly, H. nitrativorans showed better tolerance to NaCl when cultured under denitrifying conditions than
previously reported for aerobic growth. Indeed, while total growth
inhibition at NaCl concentrations of ⬎1% was previously reported for H. nitrativorans under aerobic conditions (21), our
results demonstrate growth and complete denitrification by this
bacterium at NaCl concentrations of up to 2%. The mechanisms
of this enhanced tolerance to NaCl could be associated with the
multisubunit Na⫹/H⫹ antiporter. A gene cluster encoding this
type of antiporter was found in the H. nitrativorans genome,
whereas genes encoding an NhaA-type Na⫹/H⫹ antiporter were
found in the genomes of the two other species. The multisubunit
Na⫹/H⫹ antiporter has been associated with high Na⫹ extrusion
activity in halotolerant Staphylococcus aureus (47). Despite having
better NaCl tolerance than the other Hyphomicrobium species, H.
nitrativorans remains quite sensitive to NaCl compared to other
bacteria isolated from denitrifying biofilms, such as Methyl-

dissipate excess reductant, which is further supported by the fact
that Nap is induced by growth on highly reduced carbon sub-

expression pattern is similar to our results for H. zavarzinii, with

that other factors, such as the presence of distinct enzymes with
similar functions, might also play an important role.
Denitrifying conditions were shown to increase the relative
gene expression level of nirK in H. nitrativorans. However, such an
effect was not observed for H. denitrificans and H. zavarzinii. No
previous studies assessed quantitatively the expression of nirK under different culture conditions in Hyphomicrobium spp. Microaerobic or anaerobic conditions are known to regulate nirK
expression in many bacterial species (59–61). In Rhodobacter
sphaeroides 2.4.3, nirK expression is regulated by NnrR, a transcriptional activator of the CRP/FNR family (60, 62). Gene annotation of the H. denitrificans genome did not reveal sequences
closely related to nnrR, which could explain the absence of regulation of nirK expression. The lack of an effect of denitrifying
conditions on H. zavarzinii is surprising, as nnrR was found
downstream of nirK. In fact, H. zavarzinii and H. nitrativorans
have the same gene arrangement in the nirK locus (Table 3), and
both showed a potential NnrR binding site (data not shown). Further work will be required in order to elucidate this phenomenon.

strates (13, 52). Despite higher levels of Nap expression under
aerobic conditions than under denitrifying conditions, we did not
detect significant nitrate reduction in aerobic liquid cultures of H.
zavarzinii. Similarly, the expression level of the Nap-␣ operon in
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.3 was higher in aerobic liquid cultures
than in anaerobic cultures, without any detectable nitrate reduction (54). However, aerobic reduction of nitrate into nitrite occurred when R. sphaeroides 2.4.3 was cultivated on solid medium,
indicating a role of Nap-␣ in redox homeostasis specific for these
culture conditions. Preliminary assays performed in our laboratory indicated that this is not the case for H. zavarzinii, but more
extensive work will have to be performed to rule out this hypothesis.
While it is not uncommon to find multiple nitrate reductases
in a single bacterium, the presence of multiple nitrate reductases
of the same type has been reported only rarely in previous studies.
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.3 possesses two Nap operons, one,
identified as Nap-␣, being similar to Nap operons found in other
Alphaproteobacteria (napKEFDABC) and the other, identified as
Nap-␤, being similar to the Nap operons found in Gammaproteobacteria (napFDAGHBC) such as Shewanella spp. and E. coli (54).
These two distinct Nap isoforms have also been reported for several strains of Shewanella (55, 56). Recently, we also described the
new bacterial species Methylophaga nitratireducenticrescens JAM1
(Gammaproteobacteria), which expresses two distinct Nar nitrate
reductases (Nar1 and Nar2) encoded by two narGHJI operons
(23, 24, 57). For this bacterium, phylogenetic analyses revealed
that Nar1 is more closely related to the Nar system of Betaproteobacteria, whereas Nar2 is more closely related to the Nar system
found in other Gammaproteobacteria, suggesting that the Nar1
system was acquired by horizontal gene transfer (23). In H. zavarzinii, while narG1 is closely related to narG sequences found in
other Alphaproteobacteria, narG2 is only distantly related to any
known narG sequence. The expression patterns of these two genes
were also slightly different, with a much stronger effect of anaerobic conditions on the expression of narG1 than on the expression
of narG2. Further work, including the production of gene knockout mutants for the different nitrate reductases in H. zavarzinii, is
necessary to completely elucidate the physiological roles played by
these enzymes.
Although the napA gene product in H. nitrativorans is more
related to Nap-␣ than to Nap-␤ of Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.3,
a distinct napA expression pattern was observed. In H. nitrativorans, napA gene expression levels were significantly higher in the
presence of nitrate and under denitrifying conditions than in the
absence of nitrate and under aerobic conditions. Similar results
have been reported for Bradyrhizobium japonicum, which also
possesses a single periplasmic nitrate reductase of the ␣ isoform
(58). Although results from studies on Paracoccus pantotrophus
and Rhodobacter sphaeroides point toward a specific role of the
Nap-␣ isoform in aerobic denitrification and redox balancing,
both the ␣ and ␤ isoforms have been associated with anaerobic
nitrate respiration in Shewanella spp. (55, 56). It is important to
note that the highest denitrification efficiencies were observed for
a Shewanella strain lacking the nap-␤ operon (55) and for a nap-␤
mutant Shewanella strain (56), indicating that the ␣ isoform plays
a major role in anaerobic respiration in this bacterial genus. Taken
together, these results further illustrate that there is no clear association between the isoform and the physiological role of Nap and

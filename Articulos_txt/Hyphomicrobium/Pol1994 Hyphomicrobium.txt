Abstract
The methylotrophic bacterium HyphomicrobiurnVS was enriched and isolated, using activated sewage sludge as
inoculum in mineral medium containing dimethylsulfide (DMS) at a low concentration to prevent toxicity. DMS
concentrations above 1 mM proved to be growth inhibiting. HyphomicrobiumVS could use DMS, dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO), methanol, formaldehyde, formate, and methylated amines as carbon and energy source. Carbon was
assimilated via the serine pathway. DMS-grown cells respired sulfide, thiosulfate, methanethiol, dimethyldisulfide
and dimethyltrisulfide.
To test Hyphomicrobium VS for application in biofiltration of air polluted with volatile sulfur compounds two
laboratory scale trickling biofilters with polyurethane and lava stone as carrier material were started up by inoculation with this bacterium. Both methanol- and DMS-grown cells could be used. Only a short adaptation period
was needed. Short term experiments showed that high concentrations of DMS (1-2 #tool 1-1) were removed very
efficiently by the biofilters at space velocities up to 100 h -~ .

Introduction
Formation of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), in particular dimethylsulfide (DMS) has been observed in
various microbial ecosystems such as soils, algal mats,
compost stacks and sewage treatment systems, as well
as in several industrial processes such as brewing and
paper manufacture (Kelly & Smith 1990). Especially in marine environments large amounts of DMS are
formed as a result of degradation of dimethylsulfoniopropionate, an osmoprotectant of algae (Kiene 1988).
The production of VSC causes environmental problems due to their high odor index and toxicity. Moreover it has been shown that sulfur-containingtrace gases are oxidized by the OH. radical in the troposphere to
SO2, which causes acid rain and contributes to cloud

formation (Charlson et al. 1987). As a result of more
stringent rules on the emission of harmful gases to
the atmosphere the need was felt for a DMS-utilizing
microorganism, which could be used in the construction of a biological filter for DMS removal. Such a
filter should be applicable for treatment of waste gases originating from for instance indoor composting
facilities (Derikx et al. 1991) and sewage treatment
plants (Buisman et al. 1990). Biological deodorization
of VSC is now attracting attention because of the low
operating cost and high ability as compared with chemical or physical processes (Kanagawa & Kelly 1986;
Shoda 1991). The isolation and characterization of a
Hyphomicrobium species able to utilize DMS as a carbon and energy source, and initial attempts to use this

with 0.2 M NaOH. Sulfide was added to a methanollimited culture to study the effect on the yield. Sulfide
was sterilized under nitrogen and separately introduced
under the liquid level of the culture.

Materials and methods

Respiration measurements
MeSa
A mineral medium was used for enrichment and cultivation. The medium contained (in g 1-~): K2HPO4,
0.4; KH2PO4, 1.0; NH4CI, 0.4; MgC12 • 6H20, 0.1;
CaClz • 2H20, 0.01; Na2CO3, 0.5; and 2 ml 1-1 trace
element solution. Trace element solution was prepared
according to Suylen & Kuenen (1986). The final pH
was adjusted to 7.1. Substrates tested for growth experiments were added to a final concentration of 10 mM
except for formaldehyde and sulfur compounds, which
were tested at I raM.

Enrichment and isolation
Enrichment of DMS-utilizing bacteria, using activated
sewage sludge as inoculum, was achieved at room temperature in mineral medium containing DMS at a low
concentration (0.015 mM liquid concentration during
the first transfers and 0,4 mM for the following ones) as
the only source of carbon and energy. Enrichment was
performed in 120 ml stoppered bottles containing 20 ml
medium, and DMS was added by syringe; after depletion of DMS new amounts were added. After 6 transfers agar plates, composed of the same mineral medium
plus 1.5% (w/v) agar, were inoculated with the enrichment culture and incubated at 30 °C in ajar containing
15 mmol 1-1 DMS in the gas phase. Purity of cultures
was checked microscopically after growth in defined
medium. Additional purity tests were performed with
mineral medium enriched with glucose, yeast extract
and tryptone, each 2 g 1-1. The latter medium does
not allow growth of methylotrophic hyphomicrobia.
Growth tests were performed at least in duplicate at
30 °C.

Continuous cultivation
Continuous cultivation was performed at 30 °C in a
350 ml glass fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific,
Nutley, NJ, USA). Methanol was added to the medium
after sterilization to a final concentration of 20 raM.
DMS as growth substrate was added by leading an
air stream containing DMS through the culture liquid.
The pH was maintained at 7.0 by automatic titration

Respiration rates of whole cells were measured polarographically in a Biological Oxygen Monitor, with a
Clark-type oxygen electrode at 30 °C. Rates were
expressed as nmol 02 rain-I mg protein-1 and were
corrected for endogenous respiration.

Preparation of cell-free extracts
Cell-free extracts were prepared by suspending ceils
(0.5 g wet weight per ml) in 50 mM Tris-HC1 buffer (pH
7.0) and breaking them by passage through a French
pressure cell at 110 MPa. After centrifugation at 40,000
x g at 4 °C for 20 rain the supernatant (crude extract)
was directly used or stored at - 20 oC.

Enzyme assays
Methanol dehydrogenase was assayed at pH 9.0
according to Duine et al. (1978). Methanethiol (MT)
oxidase activity was determined gaschromatographically by measuring the disappearance of MT in the
headspace of an incubation mixture (total volume t.2
ml) in a stoppered 100 ml bottle. The mixture contained
50 mM Tris-HC1 buffer, pH 8.2, 1 #mol MT and about
0.15 mg of protein. DMS mono-oxygenase activity was
assayed according to De Bont et al. (1981). NAD +and DCPIP-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase
and formate dehydrogenase were assayed according to
Suylen et al. (t986). NAD+-dependent malate dehydrogenase was assayed by following the oxaloacetatedependent oxidation of NADH at 340 nm. Reaction
mixtures contained 25 mM glycytglycine buffer (pH
7.4), 0.24 mM NADH, 0.25 mM oxaloacetate and an
appropriate amount of cell extract (about 0.15 mg protein per ml). Hydroxypyruvate reductase was determined according to Blackmore & Quayle (1970) except
that 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was used as
buffer. Catalase was assayed according to Haywood &
Large (1981).

Air biofiltration
A lab-scale biofilter (trickling filter principle) was constructed of a glass-cylinder (90 mm ~ x 450 mm)

107
packed either with oblong pieces (15 cm in length) of
polyurethane, having a T-shaped cross-section (I0 x
10 x 3 mm), or with lava stone (8-16 mm 0). DMScontaining air was saturated with water and supplied
at the bottom of the cylinder at room temperature. The
air flow is expressed as space velocity, i.e., the flow
rate divided by the biofilter volume. From a l-liter
container growth medium was recirculated intermittantly in order to remove the sulfuric acid produced
in the biofilter. Every 30 min 0.5 liter of medium was
sprayed on top of the packing material via a perforated
plate. This took about 10 s. The medium was pH regulated between 6.7 and 7.0 by simultaneous addition
of fresh medium and a NaOH solution (0.2 M). In this
way the concentration of Na2SO4 never exceeded 20
mM. The filter was inoculated by replacing 400 ml of
the recirculation fluid with a culture of Hyphomicrobium VS with an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of
about 1.0.

Analytical procedures
DMS and MT were determined gaschromatographically as described earlier (Derikx et al. 1990). For cellfree extracts protein was determined with the Bio-Rad
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA, USA) protein
reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For
protein analysis of whole cells the Lowry method was
used. Methanol was determined gaschromatographically according to Teunissen et al. (1989). Sulfate and
thiosulfate were determined using the HPLC-system
described by Van Alebeek et al. (1992).

Results

Isolation and characterization of a DMS-utilizing
bacterium
A DMS-utilizing bacterium was successfully enriched
using activated sludge as inoculum in a mineral medium in which DMS was present as carbon and energy
source. Low concentrations of DMS were a prerequisite, since DMS concentrations above 1 mM proved
to be growth inhibiting. After streaking on agar plates
and incubation for about 14 days in a jar, containing
DMS and air in the gas phase, small colonies were
visible. Upon microscopical examination all colonies
appeared to consist of Hyphomicrobium-like cells. A
number of colonies were selected and all were able
to grow on methanol. One colony was subcultured

further and designated Hyphomicrobium strain VS.
Cells were ovoid (0.5-1 × 1.2-2.3 #m) with a single polar hypha. Hyphae were up to three times the
length of the cell and produced buds. Motility was
observed for small cells and maturing buds. Hyphomicrobium VS was unable to grow on a complex medium containing glucose, yeast extract and tryptone.
Its methylotrophic nature was shown by the ability
to grow aerobically on a broad spectrum of reduced
Cl-compounds (Table 1). No growth was found on
urea, glyoxylate, lactate, pyruvate, malate, succihate, citrate, ribose, fructose, glucose, glycine, serine,/3-alanine, asparagine, aspartate, acetate, butyrate,
3-hydroxybutyrate, dichloromethane, carbon disulfide, dimethyldisulfide (DMDS), dimethyltrisulfide
(DMTS) and thiosulfate. Unlike many other Hyphomicrobium species, strain VS was unable to grow anaerobically on methanol with nitrate as electron acceptor. Growth on ethanol occurred only to a very small
extent. However this substrate could be used very well
as an additional source of energy and/or carbon since
addition of ethanol (10 raM) to methanol (60 mM) cultures resulted in an increase in OD600 from 1.6 to 2.2.
Yeast extract was stimulatory but did not increase the
yield in batch cultures grown on methanol. Growth was
observed between pH 6.0 and 8.0 with an optimum at
pH 7.0. The temperature optimum was 30 °C.

Growth of Hyphomicrobium VS in batch and continuous culture
The maximum growth rate (#,naz) on methanol in
batch culture was 0.14 4- 0.01 h -1 (n = 6). The yield
(Y) amounted to 13.2 ± 0.7 (n = 5) g dry weight
mole- 1. Values found for #max and YCH3OH in a continuous culture were 0.12 h -1 and 13.4 ± 1.1 (n = 7)
g dry weight mole-1, respectively, at a dilution rate
(D) of 0A h -1. Due to toxicity of DMS and acidification of the medium during growth, studies with
batch cultures on DMS were not easy to perform. To
overcome this problem Hyphomicrobium VS was first
grown batch-wise in the chemostat on methanol (60
raM) after which DMS addition was started and the
D was set at 0.02 h -1 . The DMS concentration in the
air stream was 100 #tool I -~, which in the absence of
consumption would result in an equilibrium concentration of 1.5 mM in the liquid phase. By increasing the
air flow-rate addition of DMS was gradually increased
within 5 days up to 15 mmol 1- I medium. During a
cultivation period of 3 weeks the respiration rate for
DMS was 244 nmol Oa m i n - 1 mg protein- 1. Increas-

ing the D to 0.04 h-1 enhanced the DMS-respiration
rate to 444 nmol 02 min -1 mg protein-I after one
week. A further increase was observed during the following two weeks of cultivation up to about 800 nmol
02 rain -1 mg protein -1. A YDNS of about 16 g dry
weight per mole was estimated. Yield measurements
were negatively influenced by cell attachment to the
walt and inner parts of the chemostat vessel. When the
organism was grown on DMSO in batch culture a btmax
of 0.065 + 0.015 h -1 (n = 3) was found. The substrate
affinity constants (K,) for DMS and methanol as estimated from the respiration rates at different substrate
concentrations were both around 3 #M.
The high affinity for DMS resulted in very low
concentrations of DMS in the gas outlet of the chemostat. A value of 2 nmol 1- I was found indicating
a liquid concentration of 0.03 #M. Neither MT nor
HaS could be demonstrated in the gas outlet. HPLCanalysis revealed that the sulfur tYom DMS was quantitatively oxidized to sulfate.

Respiration of Hyphomicrobium VS grown under
various conditions
Methanol-grown Hyphomicrobium VS cells were able
to respire the growth substrates methanol, formaldehyde, formate and ethanol, but not the methylated
amines, methylated sulfides and DMSO (Table 1). Sulfide however could be respired very actively. In order
to see if energy could be derived from its respiration, sulfide was added at 3 m M feed concentration
to methanol limited continuous cultures (D = 0.023
and 0.1 h - l ) . An increase in yield was not observed.
Moreover, DMS and MT respiration were not induced.
Upon addition of limiting amounts of sulfide (80 #M)
during respiration measurements the ratio of oxygen
consumed per mole of sulfide added was (1-1.2):1 for
methanol-grown cultures, indicating an initial oxidation product at the level of thiosulfate. The same ratio
was found both for the methanol plus sulfide- and for
the DMS-grown chemostat cultures. However, for the
latter cultures the respiration curves were biphasic: the
final rates were significantly higher compared to the

109
endogenous respiration, indicating a slow sequential
oxidation of the initial product. Indeed DMS-grown
cells respired thiosulfate, although at a slower rate than
sulfide. Methanol-grown cells did not respire thiosulfate but this activity could be rapidly induced by the
addition of thiosulfate (5 raM) to the chemostat.
After addition of DMS (< 0.15 raM)to a methanoldepleted batch culture the capacity to respire methylated sulfides was observed after a further 4 h incubation
period, and a maximum respiration rate of DMS of
about t50 nmol O2 rain- 1 mg protein- l was achieved
after 18 h.
Cells grown on DMS in a continuous culture
were more versatile in their respiration compared to
methanol-grown cells (Table 1). Cells grown on DMSO
were also able to respire MT, DMS, thiosulfate and to
a much lesser extent methanol.

Enzyme activities
Cell-free extracts of methanol-grown Hyphomicrobium VS cells displayed high activities of methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate
dehydrogenase (Table 2). Moreover, high activities
of malate dehydrogenase, hydroxypyruvate reductase
and catalase were measured. This indicates that the
methanol assimilation of strain VS is similar to that
of other Hyphomicrobium species and follows the serine pathway (Harder et al. 1973). DMS-grown cells
also possessed the above-mentioned carbon assimilating and dissimilating enzyme activities (data not
shown). Extracts from DMS-grown cells further contained a MT oxidase activity of about 200 nmol rain-1
mg protein- 1. All attempts to demonstrate in cell-free
extracts DMS mono-oxygenase, the enzyme proposed
to be responsible for the first step in the assimilation
of DMS, were not successful.

Application of Hyphomicrobium VS in air biofiltration
A biofilter (2.5 1 volume) with polyurethane as carrier
material was started up by inoculation with a DMSadapted culture of Hyphomicrobium VS (Fig. 1). The
initial air flow rate in this experiment was set at a
space velocity of 6.25 h - 1 with aDMS concentration of
about 1 #mol 1-1. Outlet DMS concentrations during
start-up were below the detection limit (< 0.6 nmol
1-1). After 4 days the concentration was increased to 4
#mol 1-1 resulting in a transient increase in outlet DMS
concentration. After 11 days the space velocity was
increased to 24 h - 1. The outlet concentration increased

to 1.5 #mol 1-1, but decreased to 0.05 #mol 1-1 within
3 days. At day 23 the space velocity was increased
further to about 100 h-1 with a concomitant decrease
in the DMS concentration of the inlet to 1.4 #mol 1- l .
The outlet DMS concentration increased to 0.1 #mol
1-1 as a result of an increased load. Subsequently inlet
DMS concentrations were gradually increased (day 24
to 27:2/~mol 1-1; from day 27:3-3.6 #mol 1-1). This
gradual increase resulted in a more or less constant.
high outlet concentration of 1.1 #mol 1-1 (from day 27
onwards). The biofilter was now operating at a capacity
of 5.3 mmol 1-1 d- 1. No other VSC were detectable
in the outlet.
A biofilter of the same dimensions, packed with
lava stone, was started by inoculation with a methanolgrown culture of Hyphomicrobium VS not yet adapted
to DMS (Fig. 2). A high space velocity of 80 h -1 ,
was applied from day 0. The inlet DMS concentration
gradually decreased from 2.5 at day 0 to 1.1 #mol
1-I at day 20. Rapid adaptation to DMS was obvious
from the high removal rate from the first day on (2.3
mmoI I-1 d - l ) . Outlet concentrations did not exceed
0.05 #mol 1-1 from day 15 onwards. An increase in
the inlet concentration (at day 24) did not increase the
outlet concentration, indicating that the biofilter was
not operating at maximum capacity. Compared to the
second week during which the filter was operated at
the same loading, the removal capacity had clearly
increased at the end of the experiment.

Discussion
By using low, non-toxic, concentrations of DMS,
we succeeded in the isolation of a Hyphomicrobium

species, designated Hyphomicrobium strain VS. Up
till now DMS-utilizing Hyphomierobium species were
all enriched on DMSO (De Bont et al. 1981; Suylen &
Kuenen 1986; Zhang et al. 1991). Besides hyphomicrobia some Thiobacillus species have been shown to
grow aerobically on DMS. These microorganisms were
enriched on inorganic sulfur compounds (Cho et al.
1991a; Kanagawa & Kelly 1986). Many growth characteristics and respiration features of our isolate were
similar to Hyphomicrobium EG isolated by Suylen et
al. (1986) and Hyphomicrobium S isolated by De Bont
et al. (1981). However, in contrast to these isolates,
Hyphomicrobium VS was able to grow on methanol.
In this respect it seems more related to Hyphomicrobium I55 recently isolated by Zhang et al. (1991) which
was able to use DMS, DMSO and methanol for growth.
Our isolate was even more versatile since growth also
occurred on formaldehyde, formate and methylated
amines, and to a lesser extent on ethanol. On methanol

the growth rate (0.14 h - 1 ) is among the highest reported for hyphomicrobia (Harder & Attwood 1978).
The respiratory enzymes for methylated sulfur
compounds of Hyphomicrobium VS were not constitutive. In Hyphomicrobium EG these enzymes were constitutive, but the levels could be enhanced by addition
of sulfide (Suylen et al. 1986). This was not observed
for Hyphomicrobium VS. Induction of these enzymes
was achieved readily by DMS: methanol-grown cells
fully adapted to DMS within one day in batch culture. Further, a biofilter inoculated with methanolgrown cells acquired the ability to remove DMS from
an airstream within one day. DMS mono-oxygenase
activity, the first enzyme in DMS metabolism, was
not found in cell-free extracts. Attempts to demonstrate this enzyme in Hyphomicrobium EG also failed
(Suylen 1988), while in Hyphomicrobium S a very low
activity (0.001 #tool rain -1 mg protein -1) could be
measured (De Bont et al. 1981). A possible explanation may be that this enzyme needs a functional electron transport chain to provide the reducing equivalents
for DMS-monooxygenase.
Sulfide respiration was constitutive and occurred at
a high rate. The results indicated that cells quickly oxidize sulfide up to the level of thiosulfate. Thiosulfate is
then further oxidized at a lower rate. Indeed, thiosulfate
could be identified by HPLC analysis as an intermediate during sulfide respiration (data not shown). Thiosulfate formation was detected in methylamine- plus
sulfide-grown chemostat cultures of Hyphomicrobium
EG (Suylen et al. 1986) and oxidation of sulfide to thiosulfate and elemental sulfur was reported recently for
Hyphomicrobium neptunium by Sasahira et al. (1991,
1992). However, for the latter organism methylated or

111
inorganic sulfur compounds were not reported to act
as carbon or energy source. Yield data for Hyphomicrobium E G demonstrate that energy was derived from
S-oxidation to the level o f sulfate (Suylen et al. 1986).
Oxidation o f D M S by DMS-grown Hyphomicrobium
VS cells resulted in sulfate formation as confirmed by
HPLC analysis. Whether the S-metabolic pathway of
D M S will gain energy remains to be studied.
Hyphomicrobium VS looks a promising organism
for application in biofiltration of air containing DMS.
It can easily be cultured at a large scale on methanol.
Only a short period for adapatation to D M S was needed. F r o m short-term experiments (circa 45 days) it
was concluded that high concentrations o f DMS ( 1 - 2
# m o l 1- t ) were removed very efficiently at relatively high space velocities (up to 100 h-1): final outlet
concentrations obtained were 0.05 #tool 1-1 (1 ppm).
This value is still well above the odor threshold level. However the inlet concentrations applied exceeded
that of most industrial air streams, so outlet concentrations below the odor threshold may be achievable at
lower inlet concentrations. Thus far efficient removal
o f volatile sulfur compounds was found by the use
o f peat biofilters inoculated with Hyphomicrobium I55
(Zhang et al. 1991), Thiobacillus species (Cho et al.
1991a,b, 1992a) or mixed cultures (Cho et al, 1992b).
Removal rates reported for DMS are in the same order
of magnitude as our values. All experiments were done
with lab-scale reactors, no reports are published on
industrial scale. Peat biofilters may have a disadvantage if acidification occurs as a results o f microbial
degradation o f the contaminants present in the waste
gas. This problem can be circumvented by spraying
the peat with water (Cho et al. 1992a). The use o f a
biological trickling filter is a good alternative. In this
type o f reactor the waste gas is forced to rise through a
column with inert packing material, on which the suitable micororganisms are immobilized. By the recirculation o f water through the system, acid produced is
continuously removed. Further, the liquid recirculation
allows control o f optimal physiological conditions i.e.,
pH, medium addition. Hence optimal microbial activity can be maintained. The suitability of such a biofilter
with immobilized Thiobacillus thioparus was demonstrated for the removal of volatile sulfur compounds
(Tanji et al. 1989). Although Hyphomicrobium was
successfully applied for removal of dichloromethane
in a trickling biofilter (Diks 1992), use of this organism for removal o f volatile sulfur compounds in such
reactors was not described before. An extra advantage

ofHyphomicrobium VS for odor treatment is its ability
to degrade methylated amines.
Both polyurethane and lava stone appeared to be
good carrier materials for immobilizing Hyphomicrobium VS in trickling filters. It was shown that the carrier
material had a large effect on the m a x i m u m removal
rates of volatile compounds in exhaust gas (Kirchner et al. 1987; Tiwaree et al. 1992), Further studies
will therefore focus on use o f different package materials and long term operation at concentrations equal
to those found in industrial exhaust gases.

A Gram-negative, aerobic, non-symbiotic bacterium (AM1V30T) was isolated from the toxic
dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum AL1V. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity,
strain AM1V30T was most closely related (97?4 % similarity) to the type strain of Hoeflea marina,
which belongs to the family Phyllobacteriaceae within the order Rhizobiales of the class
Alphaproteobacteria. A polyphasic approach was used to clarify the taxonomic position of strain
AM1V30T. During the course of this study, a second species was described by others as belonging
to the genus Hoeflea, namely Hoeflea phototrophica; it showed a somewhat higher level of
16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with respect to strain AM1V30T (98?2 %) and was also taken
into account. The fatty acid profiles, physiological and biochemical data and DNA G+C content
(59?7 mol%) support the classification of strain AM1V30T as a member of the genus Hoeflea.
The characteristics of the novel strain were sufficiently distinct to indicate that it represents a
separate species. To confirm this conclusion, DNA–DNA hybridizations were performed: low values
(between 15?8 and 29?8 %) were obtained in all cases. Thus, AM1V30T represents a novel species
within the genus Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea alexandrii sp. nov. is proposed. Strain
AM1V30T (=CECT 5682T=DSM 16655T) is the type strain.

The Taxonomic Outline of the Prokaryotes (Garrity et al.,
2004) indicates that the family Phyllobacteriaceae consists of eight genera representing various origins and
lifestyles: Phyllobacterium (Knösel, 1984), Aminobacter
(Urakami et al., 1992), Aquamicrobium (Bambauer et al.,
1998), Defluvibacter (Fritsche et al., 1999), ‘Candidatus
Liberobacter’ (Jagoueix et al., 1994), Mesorhizobium (Jarvis
et al., 1997), Nitratireductor (Labbé et al., 2004) and
Pseudaminobacter (Kämpfer et al., 1999). Two other genera,
Parvibaculum (Schleheck et al., 2004) and Hoeflea (Peix
et al., 2005), have since been proposed for consideration
as members of this family, on the basis of 16S rRNA gene
sequence data. The genus Hoeflea was created to accommodate a single species, Hoeflea marina, based on a strain of
marine origin (from the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Germany)
previously assigned to the species Agrobacterium ferrugineum (Peix et al., 2005). More recently, a second species
within this genus was proposed, Hoeflea phototrophica (Biebl
The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene
sequence of strain AM1V30T is AJ786600.

et al., 2006), for isolates from cultures of marine dinoflagellates (three strains from Alexandrium lusitanicum and
two from Prorocentrum lima). This study deals with the
characterization of a novel isolate, strain AM1V30T, and the
proposal of a novel species of the genus Hoeflea.
Strain AM1V30T was isolated from a culture of the toxinproducing marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum
AL1V (Instituto Español de Oceanografia, Vigo, Spain).
Alexandrium minutum is a planktonic species associated
with shellfish poisoning events (toxic, paralytic) in coastal
regions around the world (Lilly et al., 2005). The specific
relationship between bacteria and dinoflagellates is not well
understood, but some authors consider that some of them
might be symbiotic, as bacteria have been detected inside
dinoflagellate cells (Cavanaugh, 1994; Lewis et al., 2001).
Strain AM1V30T is able to grow axenically in vitro and it
also yields blooms in cultures of the microalga from which
it was isolated and of another closely related clone (AL4V).
For isolation of bacteria, samples of the harvested dinoflagellate culture were taken under sterile conditions, washed
in 16 PBS and then collected again by centrifugation. Cells
were sonicated (Branson 2200E-1; Branson Ultrasonic) for

5 min with 1 min intervals on ice. Aliquots of the sonicated
dinoflagellate cell suspension were streaked on full- and
half-strength marine agar 2216 (Difco) for 7 days at 15 uC.
Only one type of colony – circular and pigmented light
brown – was obtained. For maintenance and further testing,
cells were incubated in marine agar or marine broth 2216
(Difco) at 30 uC unless stated otherwise.

containing antibiotics at the following concentrations:
ampicillin, 25 mg; cephalothin, 30 mg; chloramphenicol,
30 mg; erythromycin, 15 mg; nalidixic acid, 30 mg; streptomycin, 15 mg; tetracycline, 30 mg; and trimethoprim, 5 mg.
The isolate was resistant to ampicillin, nalidixic acid and
trimethoprim and sensitive to streptomycin, tetracycline,
cephalothin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol.

Cell morphology of cultures (after 3–4 days incubation) was
observed under a Zeiss Axioskop light microscope; phasecontrast observations were included. The size and ultrastructure of the cells were determined by transmission
electron microscopy (see Supplementary Fig. S1 available in
IJSEM Online). Cells were negatively stained with uranyl
acetate (2 % w/v, pH 4?5) and were observed with a
JEOL1010 microscope (Centro de Biologı́a Molecular,
Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain): monotrichous polar flagellation was observed (Supplementary
Fig. S1).

Genomic DNA was extracted from bacterial cells and
purified using the Fast DNA kit (Qbiogene). The 16S rRNA
gene was amplified by a PCR using the primers 27f [59AGAGTTTGATC(C/A)TGGCTCAG-39] and 1492r [59-TACGG(C/T)TACCTTGTTACGACTT-39] (Lane, 1991). PCR
amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was done as described
by Orphan et al. (2001) and the products were sequenced
directly as described by Moore et al. (1999). The Taq
dideoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin Elmer
Applied Biosystems) was used to sequence the 16S rRNA
gene. The reactions were run on an Applied Biosystems 373S
DNA sequencer.

Growth was assessed at 4, 10, 20, 30, 37, 42 and 50 uC and at
pH 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. To assess the salinity requirements/
tolerance of strain AM1V30T, 0, 0?8, 1?5, 3, 6 and 10 % NaCl
or 2?5 and 5 % sea salts (Sigma) were added to salt-free
ZoBell medium, half-strength ZoBell medium and fullstrength ZoBell medium (Oppenheimer & ZoBell, 1952).
In all cases, both broth and solid media were tested. For
comparison purposes, strain AM1V30T was also inoculated
into basal medium agar consisting of 0?3 % yeast extract
(Difco), 1 % Bacto-peptone (Becton Dickinson), 0?5 %
NaCl (Merck) and 1?5 % agar (Pronadisa). The optimal
temperature for growth was 30 uC. Strain AM1V30T was
unable to grow at 4 or 50 uC. This micro-organism required
pH values within the range 6–9, optimal growth occurring
at pH 7. Regarding salinity, growth was supported at 0
(salt-free ZoBell medium without added salts) to 11?8 %
total salts (half-strength ZoBell medium plus 10 % NaCl).
Optimal growth occurred at 0–6?8 % total salts, indicating that strain AM1V30T must be considered as a marine
organism that exhibits moderate halotolerance. No significant difference in the growth rate was observed with media
employing only NaCl instead of sea salts (or sea salts plus
NaCl). This, together with the fact that salt-free media supported growth, shows that, despite its marine origin, strain
AM1V30T does not have any specific ionic requirement.
The isolate was tested by using standard procedures
(Gerhardt et al., 1994) and using the whole test spectrum
of the bioMérieux API 20NE kit (for biochemical reactions)
and the API ZYM kit (for extracellular enzyme activities).
Strips were incubated at 30 uC for 24 h (API ZYM) or 48 h
(API 20NE). Carbohydrate metabolism was investigated
using API 50 CH strips (bioMérieux) in conjunction with
API 50 CHB/E medium and according to the instructions
of the manufacturer. API 50 CH strips were read after
incubation for 24 and 48 h at 30 uC.
The response of strain AM1V30T to different antibiotics
was tested by using filter-paper discs (Mast Diagnostics)
1992

Sequences were compared with public sequences in the
EMBL gene sequence databases by using the BLAST program
(National Center for Biotechnology Information; http://
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Related sequences were further analysed
using the program package ARB (Ludwig et al., 2004; http://
www.arb-home.de). Sequence alignments were corrected
manually using the sequence editor ARB_EDIT. Phylogenetic
analysis using alternative treeing methods (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and distance matrix) and data
subsets was performed using the appropriate ARB tools
(Ludwig et al., 1998). Fig. 1 shows the tree derived by
analysis with Jukes–Cantor corrections. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strain AM1V30T is a member of the family
Phyllobacteriaceae, its closest relatives being H. phototrophica
and H. marina (98?2 and 97?4 % sequence similarity to the
respective type strains). Levels of similarity to sequences
from species of neighbouring genera were significantly
lower: Mesorhizobium, 96?2–96?8 %; Phyllobacterium, 94?4–
96?2 %; Aminobacter, 95?9–96?1 %; Pseudaminobacter,
95?4–96?0 %; Nitratireductor, 95?8 %; Defluvibacter, 95?7 %;
and Aquamicrobium, 95?6 %. Moreover, the sequence of strain
AM1V30T consistently aligned with those of the two Hoeflea
species, regardless of the treeing method, which means that
it can be considered as a member of the same genus.
The DNA G+C content (mol%) was determined by HPLC
at the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und
Zellkulturen (DSMZ; Braunschweig, Germany) according
to the procedure of Mesbah et al. (1989). Strain AM1V30T
has a DNA G+C content of 59?7 mol%, which is 6?6 mol%
higher than that of H. marina LMG 128T (53?1 mol%) (Peix
et al., 2005) but almost identical to that of H. phototrophica
DFL-43T (59?3 mol%) (Biebl et al., 2006).
The cellular fatty acid composition of strain AM1V30T was
analysed by GLC at the DSMZ, using a method described
previously (Kämpfer & Kroppenstedt, 1996). The profile
obtained largely resembled those of the two Hoeflea species,

except with regard to the relative amounts and the presence
or absence of some fatty acids in one of the three organisms
(Table 1).
The production of bacteriochlorophyll a by strain AM1V30T
was investigated as described by Biebl et al. (2006) for H.
phototrophica: the absorption spectrum lacked the peaks
of bacteriochlorophyll a and a carotenoid that are found
in H. phototrophica. Thus, in this respect, strain AM1V30T
resembles H. marina.
As has been indicated above, strain AM1V30T belongs to the
genus Hoeflea on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data.
The values for sequence similarity with respect to the type
strains of the two species of the genus, H. phototrophica and H.
marina (98?2 and 97?4 %, respectively), are above the limit
suggested by Stackebrandt & Goebel (1994) as defining
bacterial species. However, given the number of phenotypic
traits that differentiate strain AM1V30T and those species (see
Table 2 and comments above), DNA–DNA hybridization was
deemed necessary to confirm its status as a separate species.
Whole-genome hybridization assays were performed at
the DSMZ. DNA was isolated using a French pressure cell
(Thermo Spectronic) and was purified by chromatography
on hydroxyapatite as described by Cashion et al. (1977).
DNA–DNA hybridization was carried out as described
by De Ley et al. (1970), with the modifications of Huß

et al. (1983), using a Cary 100 Bio UV/VIS spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier-thermostatted 666
multicell changer and a temperature controller with an
in situ temperature probe (Varian). Experiments were run in
duplicate, giving the following results: strain AM1V30T
against H. marina DSM 16791T, 15?8 and 17?2 %; strain
AM1V30T against H. phototrophica DSM 17068T, 29?8
and 21?3 %. The low values obtained support the definitive conclusion that strain AM1V30T represents a novel
species within the genus Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea
alexandrii sp. nov. is proposed.

Description of Hoeflea alexandrii sp. nov.
Hoeflea alexandrii (a.lex.an9dri.i. N.L. gen. n. alexandrii
of Alexandrium, the genus name of the dinoflagellate
Alexandrium minutum, the source of isolation of the type
strain).
Cells are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming rods, about
2?560?8 mm in size and motile by single polar flagella.
Colonies on marine agar 2216 are circular, around 1–2 mm
in diameter and pigmented light brown after 2 days
incubation at 30 uC. Optimal growth occurs at 30 uC and
pH 7. The temperature and pH ranges for growth are
10–42 uC and pH 6–9, respectively. Shows no specific ionic
requirement, growing with salts in the range 0–11?8 %
(optimally between 0 and 6?8 %). Oxidase-negative and
catalase-positive. Does not reduce nitrate to nitrite or nitrogen. The following API 20NE tests give positive results:
hydrolysis of aesculin and b-galactosidase activity (PNPG).
1994

The following API 20NE tests give negative results: nitrate
reduction, indole production, acids from glucose, arginine
dihydrolase, urease, hydrolysis of gelatin and assimilation
of D-glucose, L-arabinose, D-mannose, D-mannitol, Nacetylglucosamine, D-maltose, gluconate, caproate, adipate,
malate, citrate and phenylacetate. Positive for the following enzyme activities (API ZYM): alkaline phosphatase,
esterase (C4), esterase lipase (C8), leucine arylamidase,
valine arylamidase, cystine arylamidase, naphthol-AS-BIphosphohydrolase, a-glucosidase and b-glucosidase. Negative for the following enzyme activities (API ZYM): lipase
(C14), trypsin, a-chymotrypsin, acid phosphatase, agalactosidase, b-galactosidase, b-glucuronidase, N-acetylb-glucosaminidase, a-mannosidase and a-fucosidase.

L-arabinose, D-ribose, D-xylose, D-glucose, D-fructose, Dmannose, inositol, D-mannitol, D-sorbitol, methyl a-Dglucopyranoside, amygdalin, arbutin, aesculin, salicin,
D-cellobiose, D-maltose, sucrose, D-trehalose, inulin, Draffinose, starch, glycogen, gentiobiose, D-turanose,
D-lyxose, D-fucose, L-fucose, potassium gluconate and
potassium 2-ketogluconate. Does not ferment erythritol,
D-arabinose, L-xylose, D-adonitol, methyl b-D-xylopyranoside, D-galactose, L-sorbose, L-rhamnose, dulcitol, methyl
a-D-mannopyranoside, N-acetylglucosamine, D-lactose, Dmelibiose, D-melezitose, xylitol, D-tagatose, D-arabitol, Larabitol or potassium 5-ketogluconate. Growth on artificial
seawater with phosphate and traces of minerals and
vitamins, supplemented with glycerol or glucose as sole
carbon source, is weak. Organic acids do not support
growth. Resistant to ampicillin (25 mg), nalidixic acid
(30 mg) and trimethoprim (5 mg); sensitive to cephalothin
(30 mg), chloramphenicol (30 mg), erythromycin (15 mg),
streptomycin (15 mg) and tetracycline (30 mg). Fatty acids
detected in strain AM1V30T include (in order of abundance): 18 : 1v7c (83?1 %), 16 : 0 (7?7 %), 11-methyl
18 : 1v7c (3?6 %), summed feature 3 (16 : 1v7c and/or
15 : 0 iso 2-OH; 2?3 %), 18 : 0 (1?4 %) and minor amounts of
other fatty acids. The DNA G+C content of the type strain
is 59?7 mol%.
The type strain, AM1V30T (=CECT 5682T=DSM 16655T),
was isolated from a culture of the toxin-producing marine
dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum AL1V (Instituto
Español de Oceanografia, Vigo, Spain).

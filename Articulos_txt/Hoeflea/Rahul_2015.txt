A Gram-stain-negative, diesel-oil-degrading, rod-shaped bacterium (designated JC234T) was
isolated from a water sample collected from diesel-oil-contaminated backwaters in Kerala, India.
Strain JC234T was oxidase- and catalase-positive, and grew at 20–35 8C and at pH 7–9. Cells
contained bacteriochlorophyll-a, hydroxydemethylspheroidene and three unidentified
carotenoids. Growth occurred under aerobic, microaerobic and phototrophic anaerobic
conditions. Strain JC234T could utilize diesel-oil as a sole source of carbon and energy. Based
on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain JC234T belonged to the genus Hoeflea within
the family Phyllobacteriaceae, and was closely related to Hoeflea alexandrii AM1V30T (98.1 %
16S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Hoeflea halophila JG120-1T (97.6 %) and other members
of the genus Hoeflea (,96.4 %). Strain JC234T showed 22¡2 % and 28¡1.5 % DNA–DNA
hybridization with Hoeflea alexandrii KCTC 22096T and Hoeflea halophila KCTC 23107T,
respectively. The DNA G+C content of strain JC234T was 54.3 mol %. The major cellular fatty
acids were C18 : 1v7c/C18 : 1v6c, C16 : 0 and C16 : 1v7c/C16 : 1v6c. Phosphatidylcholine,
phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol were
the major polar lipids. Strain JC234T contained Q10 as the predominant ubiquinone. On the
basis of morphological, physiological, genetic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomical analyses, we
conclude that strain JC234T represents a novel species of the genus Hoeflea, for which the
name Hoeflea olei sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JC234T (5KCTC 42071T5LMG
28200T). An emended description of the genus Hoeflea is also provided.

Reclassification of Agrobacterium ferrugineum LMG 128
(Ahrens, 1968; Rüger & Höfle, 1992) resulted in the
creation of the genus Hoeflea (Peix et al., 2005) with
Hoeflea marina as the type species. At the time of writing,
the genus Hoeflea comprises six species with validly
published names (http://www.bacterio.net/hoeflea.html):

The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the 16S rRNA and
puf gene sequences of strain JC234T are HG965759 and LN811447,
respectively.

(Biebl et al., 2006), Hoeflea alexandrii (Palacios et al.,
2006), Hoeflea anabaenae (Stevenson et al., 2011), Hoeflea
halophila (Jung et al., 2013) and Hoeflea suaedae (Chung
et al., 2013), all isolated from marine habitats. Members
of the genus Hoeflea are Gram-stain-negative, aerobic or
microaerobic, non-endospore-forming and halotolerant.
The DNA G+C content of members of the genus
ranges from 53 to 60 mol %. Diphosphatidylglycerol,
phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE),
phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PME), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), sulfoquinovo- syldiacylglycerol (SQDG),
a few unidentified glycolipids, unidentified aminolipids
and unidentified lipids are the major polar lipids of the
genus Hoeflea. Hoeflea phototrophica is the only species of
this genus reported to have bacteriochlorophyll-a (Bchl-a)
and puf genes; however it lacks anaerobic growth in the
dark or light (Biebl et al., 2006). In this study, we characterize a newly isolated strain (JC234T) as a novel species

of the genus Hoeflea which can utilize diesel-oil for growth,
contains Bchl-a and puf genes and can grow anaerobically
in the light.
Strain JC234T was isolated from an oil-contaminated
backwater sample collected from Vembanad Lake, Kerala,
India (GPS coordinates 98 359 N 768 239 E) during December
2013. The water sample that yielded strain JC234T had a pH
of 7, a temperature of 29 8C and a salinity of 1.8 % (w/v).
The water sample with traces of oil was inoculated into
250 ml conical flasks containing 100 ml mineral salts
medium [comprising (g l21): KH2PO4 (0.5), MgSO4.
7H2O (0.2), NH4Cl (0.6), CaCl2.2H20 (0.05) and 5 ml
ferric citrate solution (0.1 %, w/v)] with 2 % (v/v) dieseloil as a carbon source, and was incubated at 30 8C with shaking at 100 r.p.m. for 3 days. Purification of bacteria was
achieved by repeated streaking on nutrient agar. Strain
JC234T was preserved as glycerol stocks and by lyophilization.
Genomic DNA was extracted and purified from strain
JC234T according to the method of Marmur (1961) and
the DNA G+C content was determined by HPLC
(Mesbah et al., 1989). 16S rRNA gene amplification and
sequencing was done as described previously (Subhash
et al., 2013). Identification of phylogenetic neighbours
and calculation of pairwise 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity were achieved using the EzTaxon-e server (Kim et al.,
2012). The CLUSTAL W algorithm of the MEGA 5.2 software
package was used for sequence alignments and MEGA 5.2
software (Tamura et al., 2011) was used for phylogenetic
analysis of the individual sequences. Distances were calculated by using the Kimura correction in a pairwise deletion
manner (Kimura, 1980). Neighbour-joining, maximumlikelihood and minimum-evolution methods in the MEGA
5.2 software were used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees.
Percentage support values were obtained using a bootstrap
procedure based on 1000 replications.
The taxonomic relationship between strain JC234T and its
closest phylogenetic neighbours was examined using DNA–
DNA hybridization (DDH) studies. Genomic relatedness
was determined by the membrane-filter technique as
described previously (Seldin & Dubnau, 1985; Tourova &
Antonov, 1987; Subhash et al., 2014). Hybridization was
performed with three replications for each sample (control:
reversal of strains was used for binding and labelling).
Morphological properties (cell shape, cell size, motility) of
strain JC234T grown on nutrient broth was observed
directly or after Gram-staining using Olympus BH-2
phase-contrast microscope. The hanging-drop method
was performed as outlined in Cappuccino & Sherman
(1998) to test motility. Malachite green was used for
spore staining as described by Schaeffer & Fulton (1933).
Internal membrane structures were viewed with a transmission electron microscope (H-7500; Hitachi), after the
cells had been processed as described by Hanada et al.
(2002). In vivo absorption spectra were measured with a
Spectronic Genesys 2 spectrophotometer using sucrose
2404

solution for cell suspension (Trüper & Pfennig, 1981).
Carotenoid composition was determined by C18-HPLC
(Subhash et al., 2014). Amplification of the puf gene fragment
was performed as described by Nagashima et al. (1997).
The pH range for growth was tested using nutrient broth,
adjusted to different pH values (pH 4.0–11.0, intervals of
0.5 pH units) by using the appropriate biological buffers as
described previously (Subhash et al., 2014). NaCl [0–10 %
(w/v) at 0.5 % intervals] and temperature (4, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 8C) ranges for growth were examined in nutrient broth and growth was measured turbidometrically at 540 nm in a colorimeter (Systronics).
Various biochemical tests such as hydrolysis of starch,
casein, gelatin and Tweens 20 and 80, oxidase, catalase,
nitrate reduction, nitrite reduction, H2S production,
methyl red and Voges–Proskauer tests were performed by
the procedures as outlined in Cappuccino & Sherman
(1998). Arginine dihydrolase, phenylalanine deaminase,
ornithine decarboxylase and lysine decarboxylase activities
were determined as described by Smibert & Krieg (1981).
Utilization of organic carbon compounds as carbon and
energy sources for organo-heterotrophic growth was tested
in a mineral medium as previously described (Lakshmi
et al., 2011) replacing sodium pyruvate with specific organic
compounds (0.35 % w/v or v/v); growth was measured turbidometrically at 540 nm after 48 h. Nitrogen source utilization was tested by replacing ammonium chloride with
7 mM (final concentration) different nitrogen sources
(NaNO3, NaNO2, glutamate, aspartate, glutamine and
urea). Utilization of glutamate, glutamine, methionine,
aspartate, peptone, Casamino acids and urea as sole
source of carbon, nitrogen and energy was also determined.
Phototrophic growth (light anaerobic) was tested in nutrient broth in fully filled screw-cap test tubes incubated at
2400 lx at 28–30 8C and chemotrophic growth was determined in nutrient broth incubated in aerobic dark at
100 r.p.m. at 28–30 8C.
Cellular fatty acids, polar lipids and quinone composition
were analysed from cultures that attained 70 % maximal
optical density (at their late exponential growth phase).
Fatty acid analysis was done as described previously
(Sasser, 1990; Subhash et al., 2014). Polar lipids analysis
was performed as described previously (Tindall, 1990;
Tindall et al., 1987; Oren et al., 1996; Subhash et al.,
2014). Respiratory quinones were analysed as described
by Xie & Yokota (2003).
To determine the diesel-oil degradation capability, strain
JC234T was grown in 250 ml conical flasks containing
100 ml mineral salts medium with 5 % (v/v) diesel-oil as
a carbon source and was incubated at 30 8C under shaking
at 100 r.p.m. for 5 days. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 000 g for 15 min at 4 8C). The diesel-oil in
the supernatant was extracted with 50 ml dichloromethane
(DCM) and collected by centrifugation at 10 000 g, 4 8C
for 10 min. The DCM fraction containing diesel-oil was
concentrated and the extracted hydrocarbons were analysed

by GC-MS. A control containing diesel-oil and no cells was
used to determine background baseline of growth and
degradation.
GC-MS analysis was done on a Pegasus HT TOF (highthroughput time-of-flight)-MS system (Leco) equipped
with an Agilent series (7890) gas chromatograph. One microlitre of sample was injected into a HP-5 column (30 m,
internal diameter 0.32 mm, thickness 0.25 mm), with
helium as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.2 ml
min21. The initial oven temperature of 60 8C was ramped
to 300 8C at 3 8C min21 and held for 5 min. Inlet temperature was 250 8C, ion source temperature 250 8C and ionization energy 270 eV. Mass spectra were recorded at 50–
1000 m/z. LecoChromaTOF software (version 4.21) was
used to process the chromatograms and the metabolites
were identified based on mass spectral comparison to a standard NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) 98 library. Mass spectral peaks showing similarity
above 700 were accepted, with maximum match equal to
1000 for statistical analysis.

The DNA G+C content of strain JC234T was 54.3 mol %

between strain JC234T and Hoeflea halophila KCTC
23107T was 28¡1.5 %; these hybridization values are well
within the recommended standards to delineate a bacterial
species based on DDH (Stackebrandt & Goebel, 1994).

The EzTaxon-e server search analysis revealed that strain
JC234T was most closely related to members of genus Hoeflea, and the highest sequence similarity was observed with
Hoeflea alexandrii AM1V30T (98.1 %), Hoeflea halophila
JG120-1T (97.6 %) and other members of the genus Hoeflea (,96.4 %). The results of phylogenetic analysis of
the 16S rRNA gene sequences suggested that strain
JC234T clustered with the members of the genus Hoeflea
and formed a separate clade along with the type strains
of Hoeflea alexandrii and Hoeflea halophila (Fig. 1).

colour intensified and become dark reddish-brown with
a diameter of 1–3 mm. Cells were Gram-stain-negative,
motile, straight rods measuring 2–5 mm long and 1–2 mm
wide (Fig. S1 available in the online Supplementary
Material). The colour of the phototrophically (anaerobic
light, 2400 lx) grown cell suspension of strain JC234T was
reddish-brown. In vivo absorption spectra exhibited
maxima at 475, 512, 589, 802, 846 and 877 nm (Fig. 2)
indicating the presence of bacteriochlorophyll-a in phototrophically grown cells of strain JC234T. Transmission
electron micrographs revealed that cells of strain JC234T
grown phototrophically had no definite internal membrane
structures (Fig. S2). Carotenoid composition from phototrophically grown cells indicated the presence of hydroxydemethylspheroidene and three unidentified carotenoids
(Fig. S3). Phototrophic growth, Bchl-a and puf genes
were identified in strain JC234T but not in Hoeflea alexandrii KCTC 22096T or Hoeflea halophila KCTC 23107T. The
highest puf gene sequence similarity (94 %) of strain
JC234T was observed with an uncultured bacterial clone
based on comparison with sequences in the GenBank database by using the program BLASTN (Altschul et al., 1997).
Among other members of the genus Hoeflea, phototrophic
growth was not reported but the presence of puf genes was
reported in Hoeflea phototrophica DFL-43T (Biebl et al.,
2006). Although strain JC234T and Hoeflea phototrophica
share the presence of Bchl-a and carotenoids, they differ
importantly in phototrophic growth (anaerobic light).
Bchl-a and carotenoids of strain JC234T were observed
only from phototrophically grown cells, while the culture
grows equally well under both phototrophic and chemotrophic conditions (Fig. S4).

Absorbance

Strain JC234T grew at pH 7–9 with optimum growth at
pH 7, and differs from Hoeflea alexandrii KCTC 22096T
and Hoeflea halophila KCTC 23107T which have a pH
range of 6–9. NaCl was not required for growth of strain
JC234T but could be tolerated up to 8 % (w/v), while the
type strains of Hoeflea alexandrii and Hoeflea halophila
are more and less tolerant, respectively (Table 1). The temperature range for growth further differentiates strain

JC234T from its closest phylogenetic neighbours. Other
physiological and biochemical results are presented in the
species description and Table 1.
The major fatty acids of strain JC234T were C18 : 1v7c/
C18 : 1v6c, C16 : 0 and C16 : 1v7c/C16 : 1v6c, with minor
amounts of C18 : 1v7c 11-methyl and C18 : 0. Strain JC234T
shared the presence of major fatty acids with
Hoeflea alexandrii KCTC 22096T and Hoeflea halophila
KCTC 23107T. However, significant differences in the
relative amounts of C16 : 1v7c/C16 : 1v6c and C18 : 1v7c 11methyl were found between strain JC234T and the type
strains of Hoeflea alexandrii and Hoelfea halophila (Table S1).
The polar lipid profile of strain JC234T contained PC, PME,
PG, PE, SQDG and unidentified lipids L1, L2 and L3 (Fig.
S5). Identification of SQDG in strain JC234T was based on
the motility of the spot as demonstrated by Chung et al.
(2013) in Hoeflea suaedae YC6898T, Hoeflea marina KACC
12993T and Hoeflea alexandrii KACC 12994T. The spot
corresponding to SQDG was eluted from the TLC plate,
dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2 : 1, v/v) and the
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum of the chloroform/methanolic extract was recorded on a Bruker FTIR
spectrometer in the wave number range of 3500–
500 cm21. The infrared spectrum of the chloroform/methanolic extract showed characteristic absorption bands
for sulfur-containing compounds at 959 cm21 and
792 cm21 indicating the presence of strong dehydration of
SO3 and symmetrical C-O-S association with a C-O-SO3
group. The above two characteristic bands and the other
absorption bands indicating the -CH3 bending and C-H
stretching confirmed the presence of SQDG (Fig. S6). The
polar lipid profile of strain JC234T was well in consonance
with the type species of the genus Hoeflea (Hoeflea
marina) which contained PC, PME, PG and PE as major
lipids as reported by Chung et al. (2013) and data from
this study (data not shown). The major quinone of strain
JC234T was ubiquinone Q10, which is in line with members
of the genus Hoeflea.
Based on the GC-MS analysis of diesel layer, various hydrocarbons were seen to decrease in abundance sequentially
based on their carbon chain length and branching. Strain
JC234T degraded almost all the hydrocarbon present in
diesel (C10–C28) which suggests that this strain could be
efficiently used for the treatment processes of various
hydrocarbon-contaminated sites (Fig. S7).
Distinct phylogenetic, genotypic, chemotaxonomic and
phenotypic properties thus justify the description of strain
JC234T as representative of a novel species of the genus
Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea olei sp. nov. is proposed. An emended description of the genus Hoeflea is
also provided. Phototrophy is a recognized genus-specific
character (Imhoff & Caumette, 2004) and hence it is debatable if a new genus needs to be described in future to
accommodate this anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium
based on multiple strains. Such description of a new
genus based on phototrophy was recently proposed for

is 20–35 uC (optimum 30 uC). Growth pH range is
pH 7–9 (optimum pH 7). NaCl is not required for growth
but can be tolerated up to 8 % (w/v). Catalase- and oxidase-positive. Negative for hydrolysis of casein, gelatin,
starch and Tweens 20 and 80. Tests for arginine dihydrolase,
phenylalanine deaminase, lysine decarboxylase, ornithine
decarboxylase, methyl red, Voges–Proskauer and production of H2S are negative. Indole is not produced from
tryptophan. Negative for nitrate and nitrite reduction.
Good growth occurs with acetate, butyrate, citrate and pyruvate as sole carbon and energy sources. Arabinose, capric
acid, cellobiose, fumarate, galactose, glycerol, lactate,
lactose, ribose, salicin, sucrose, sorbitol, tagatose and
xylose are not used as sole sources of carbon and energy.
Ammonium chloride is used as sole nitrogen source;
cannot use glutamine or glutamate as sole source of
carbon/nitrogen and energy. PC, PME, PG, PE, SQDG
and three unidentified lipids (L1, L2 and L3) are the polar
lipids. The major quinone is ubiquinone Q10. Major fatty
acids are C18 : 1v7c/C18 : 1v6c, C16 : 0 and C16 : 1v7c/
C16 : 1v6c along with C18 : 1v7c 11-methyl and C18 : 0 in

The description of the genus is as given by Peix et al. (2005)
with the following modifications. Some species show
microaerobic growth and lack motility. Oxidase activity is
negative in some species. Some members of the genus contain photosynthetic reaction-centre genes puf and form
photosynthetic pigments such as bacteriochlorophyll-a
and carotenoids. Chemo-organotrophic with or without
photosynthetic pigments, but some species are phototrophic. Phosphatidylcholine, unidentified glycolipids, unidentified aminolipid and unidentified lipids are also
present in some species. C16 : 1v7c/C16 : 1v6c can also be
present in major amounts (w3 %). C18 : 1v7c 11-methyl
and C16 : 0 can be present in minor amounts (v3 %).
C19 : 0cyclov8c is absent in some species. Some species
require NaCl for growth and can tolerate concentrations
up to 10–11 % (w/v) and pH of 5–10. Temperature range
for growth is 4–42 uC. Some species can degrade dieseloil. The DNA G+C content is 53.1–59.7 mol %.

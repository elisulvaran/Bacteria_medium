Within a collection of marine strains that were shown to contain the photosynthesis reaction-centre
genes pufL and pufM, a novel group of alphaproteobacteria was found and was characterized
phenotypically. The 16S rRNA gene sequence data suggested that the strains belonged to the
order Rhizobiales and were closest (98?5 % sequence similarity) to the recently described species
Hoeflea marina. The cells contained bacteriochlorophyll a and a carotenoid, presumably
spheroidenone, in small to medium amounts. Cells of the novel strains were small rods and were
motile by means of single polarly inserted flagella. Good growth occurred in complex media
with 0?5–7?0 % sea salts, at 25–33 6C (optimum, 31 6C) and at pH values in the range 6–9. With
the exception of acetate and malate, organic carbon sources tested supported poor growth
or no growth at all. Growth factors were required; these were provided by small amounts of yeast
extract, but not by standard vitamin solutions. Growth occurred under aerobic to microaerobic
conditions, but not under anaerobic conditions, either in the dark or light. Nitrate was not reduced.
Photosynthetic pigments were formed at low to medium salt concentrations, but not at the salt
concentration of sea water (3?5 %). On the basis of smaller cell size, different substrate utilization
profile and photosynthetic pigment content, the novel strains can be classified as representatives of
a second species of Hoeflea, for which the name Hoeflea phototrophica sp. nov. is proposed.
The type strain of Hoeflea phototrophica sp. nov. is DFL-43T (=DSM 17068T=NCIMB 14078T).

Bacterial photosynthesis appears to contribute, to some
extent, to the energy generation of heterotrophs in the open
oceans. Kolber et al. (2001) calculated, by extrapolation
from measurements of bacteriochlorophyll a in tropical seas,
that up to 10 % of the bacterioplankton were potentially
capable of photosynthesis. In a recent survey, Schwalbach &
Fuhrman (2005) quantified aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs
(AAPs) by means of epifluorescence microscopy and quantitative PCR and found them to constitute 1–2 % of all bacteria
in the euphotic zone off the coast of Southern California. In
estuarine waters, it has been estimated that AAPs constitute

>10 % of total bacteria. We have recently isolated a large
number of pigmented strains from different habitats of the
North Sea and checked them for the presence of genes for
the photosynthetic apparatus, namely the pufL and pufM
genes, which code for proteins of the photosynthetic reaction centre (Allgaier et al., 2003). The 16 strains that were
positive for these genes were classified into five phylogenetic
groups on the basis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences. None
of them could be assigned to an existing species.
Here we describe a group consisting of five strains that
belong to the a-2 subgroup of the Proteobacteria and which
initially showed the greatest level of 16S rRNA gene sequence
similarity with Ahrensia kielensis (Ahrens, 1968; Uchino
et al., 1998). However, after our phenotypic characterization
of these novel strains was completed, the first description
of the micro-organism Hoeflea marina was published by
Peix et al. (2005). On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences,
the novel strains were found to be more closely related
to H. marina than to A. kielensis. Both A. kielensis and
H. marina were originally described by Ahrens (1968)
as marine Agrobacterium species forming star-shaped

aggregates and were subsequently reclassified (Rüger &
Höfle, 1992; Uchino et al., 1998; Peix et al., 2005). In contrast to related genera and species, the novel strains in this
study were able to form photosynthetic pigments, in particular bacteriochlorophyll a, if appropriate conditions were
provided.

(Fig. 1c) and showed rapid movement. Electron micrographs
of shadow-cast cells of strain DFL-43T showed monotrichous flagellation at one or both poles (Fig. 1a). In strain
DFL-43T, distinct capsules were visible around the cells.
Ultrathin sections revealed a typical Gram-negative cell-wall
structure (Fig. 1b).

The isolates were obtained from cultures of marine dinoflagellates. Three strains (DFL-13, DFL-33 and DFL-44) were
from Alexandrium lusitanicum ME207 and two strains (DFL42 and DFL-43T) were from Prorocentrum lima ME130. Both
cultures were maintained in the dinoflagellate collection of
the Biological Institute of the island of Helgoland (German
Bight). Single algal cells were washed and plated onto agar
plates prepared with 10-fold-diluted Difco marine broth
2216. Strains DFL-43T and DFL-44 were selected for further
characterization.

For most of the physiological tests, a complex medium was
used consisting of (l21) 20 g sea salts, 3 g peptone and 0?5 g
yeast extract. If necessary, it was replaced by a mineral
medium with sodium acetate as the carbon source (Biebl et al.,
2005). The temperature range for growth was determined by
using a temperature-gradient shaking incubator (Toyo
Kogaku Sangyo) that allowed growth to be followed between
15 and 45 uC (at increments of 3 uC) through periodic
measurement of the optical density (600 nm). Good growth
was found between 25 and 33 uC, the optimum being at
31 uC. At 15 uC, the growth rate was only 1/5th of the
maximum rate. No growth occurred above 35 uC. The novel
strains were able to grow at pH values between 5?8 and 9?5.
Between pH 6?0 and 9?0, initial culture development was
almost the same. Sea salts were required at a concentration
of at least 0?5 %; concentrations up to 7 % were tolerated.

Colonies of surface cultures were light-beige on full-strength
marine broth 2216 (Difco) and wine-red on 10-fold-diluted
marine broth. They were of a smooth consistency, relatively
flat and exhibited an opaque centre and a translucent halo.
The cells were small, short, rods, 0?3–0?560?7–2?0 mm

Hoeflea phototrophica sp. nov.

The utilization of carbon sources was checked in a mineral
sea-water medium containing 0?1 g yeast extract l21 to
provide the required growth factors. The following carbon
sources were tested at a concentration of 1 g l21 (acids as
sodium salts): acetate, butyrate, succinate, fumarate, malate,
lactate, citrate, glutamate, pyruvate, glucose, fructose,
ethanol, methanol, glycerol and yeast extract. Moderate
growth was obtained only with yeast extract and with acetate
or malate. The other substrates tested allowed only limited
growth, with OD600 values ranging from 20 (glucose) to
60 % (fumarate, citrate) of that of the acetate culture;
methanol and ethanol did not allow any growth at all. In
this respect, the novel strains resemble the type strain of
A. kielensis, which did not use any of the carbon sources
tested (Rüger & Höfle, 1992). H. marina was found to use
a series of sugars and sugar alcohols, including glucose (Peix
et al., 2005). Experiments involving culture of the cells
with acetate as the substrate and several additives,
e.g. yeast extract (0?1 g l21), vitamin-free and vitamincontaining Casamino acids (0?25 g l21; Difco) as well as a
vitamin solution (consisting of biotin, thiamine, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, vitamin B12, pyridoxine and 6aminobenzoic acid), showed that growth factors were
required. These growth factors were provided by yeast
extract, but not by any of the administered vitamins and
amino acids.
The novel strains were unable to decompose or liquefy any
of the following polymers: starch, alginate, gelatin and
Tween 80 (for lipase activity). They were positive for catalase
and oxidase activity, did not form indole from tryptophan
and were unable to form nitrite and nitrogen from nitrate
under air-exclusion conditions. Antibiotic inhibition was
observed with penicillin G, tetracycline and chloramphenicol, but not with polymyxin B. Anaerobic growth by the
fermentation of glucose was not observed, but there was
some sensitivity to full oxygen exposure, as the growth zone
in agar deep culture was distinctly below the surface. No

growth occurred under anaerobic conditions in the light
when acetate was the substrate.
In several aerobic phototrophic bacteria (exclusively freshwater organisms), reduction of toxic potassium tellurite to
inert elemental tellurium (deposited in the cytoplasm) has
been observed (Yurkov et al., 1996). Strains DFL-43T and
DFL-44 also possessed this capability. After 4 days growth in
peptone medium to which 0?05–1 g l21 potassium tellurite
had been added, cultures turned jet-black and refractile
inclusions were visible in the cells.
Cellular fatty acids were determined as described by Labrenz
et al. (1998). The percentages of fatty acids found in strain
DFL-43T and in H. marina and A. kielensis are shown in

Table 1. Strain DFL-44 had almost the same values as strain
DFL-43T. As is usually the case for the Alphaproteobacteria,
the mono-unsaturated straight chain acid 18 : 1v7 was
the major component (63–85 %), replaced, in part, by the
methylated form, particularly in strain DFL-43T (21 %).
Strain DFL-43T, H. marina and A. kielensis all contained the
saturated acids 16 : 0 and 18 : 0, albeit in small amounts,
whereas the fatty acids 16 : 1v7 and 19 : 1 cyclo were found
only in strain DFL-43T and in H. marina. The type strain of
A. kielensis contained a hydroxylated 12 : 0 acid and a 20 : 0
acid that were not found in either strain DFL-43T or H.
marina. Polar lipids were extracted and separated by TLC
according to Tindall (1990). For strain DFL-43T, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine were the predominant polar
lipids. Moderate amounts of phosphatidylcholine and sulfoquinovosyldiacetylglycerol were present and only minor
amounts of diphosphatidylglycerol and an unknown amino
lipid were found. Interestingly, A. kielensis contained the
same lipids, albeit in somewhat different proportions; in
particular, the amount of phosphatidylethanolamine was
much lower. H. marina differed from the other strains in
that it lacked phosphatidylcholine.
Distinct pigmentation was observed on 10-fold-diluted
marine agar 2216, but not on the original medium containing (l21) 5 g peptone, 1 g yeast extract and about 30 g
salts. Liquid cultures containing (l21) 3 g peptone and 0?5 g
yeast extract and varied amounts of sea salts revealed that
pigment production was dependent on the salt concentration. Cultures containing 3, 6 and 9 g sea salts l21 appeared

very pink, while cultures at the salt concentration of natural
sea water were colourless. The cell mass from 30 ml culture
grown at 6 g sea salts l21 was extracted with 3 ml acetone/
methanol (7 : 2) and the absorption spectrum of the extract
was recorded (Fig. 2). It showed the typical maxima of
bacteriochlorophyll a at 367 and 775 nm and a high peak at
482 nm, indicating the presence of a carotenoid. Table 2
shows the specific bacteriochlorophyll a content for both
novel strains at the sea salts concentrations indicated. The in
vivo absorption spectrum obtained by suspension of cells in
75 % glycerol showed only weak absorption in the infrared
region because of the low pigment content, but peaks at
around 800 and 865 nm were recognizable (not shown). It
can be inferred that the carotenoid peak (at 482 nm) of the
solvent extract originates from spheroidenone. The peak was
almost identical to that of Dinoroseobacter shibae in which
the carotenoid has been identified as spheroidenone (Biebl
et al., 2005).
To identify the closest phylogenetic neighbours of strain
DFL-43T, 16S rRNA sequences were manually aligned and
compared with published sequences from the 16S rRNA
gene sequence database of the Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Germany), including
sequences available from the Ribosomal Database Project (Maidak et al., 2001) and EMBL. Sequences were
aligned using the BioEdit program (Hall, 1999). A phylogenetic dendrogram was inferred using DNADIST and
the neighbour-joining method of the PHYLIP package
(Felsenstein, 1993). Bootstrap analysis was based on 1000
resamplings.

Even though the first variable region of the 16S rRNA gene
sequences of strains DFL-43T and DFL-44 was more closely
related to that of A. kielensis, the almost-complete 16S rRNA
gene sequences of the novel strains revealed them to be most
closely related to H. marina. The phylogenetic position
of strain DFL-43T as a novel member within the family
Phyllobacteriaceae is shown in Fig. 3. Its phylogenetic position within the a-2 subgroup of the Alphaproteobacteria
is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, available in IJSEM
Online.
The major phenotypic differences between strains DFL-43T
and DFL-44 and the species with greatest similarity in terms
of 16S rRNA gene sequence, i.e. H. marina and A. kielensis,
are listed in Table 3. Although the 16S rRNA gene sequence
comparisons indicate that the novel strains are very close to
H. marina (98?5 % similarity) and more distant to A.
kielensis (94?4 % similarity), there are marked phenotypic
differences between the novel strains and both of these
recognized species and these are also reflected in the wide
range of DNA G+C contents. Strains DFL-43T and DFL44 are distinguished from H. marina and A. kielensis by
possessing bacteriochlorophyll a and carotenoids, possibly
enabling them to generate additional energy from light. In
addition, they differ from H. marina by their smaller cell
size, by their inability to grow well in mineral media
with defined organic compounds and by the presence of
phosphatidylcholine. In contrast to A. kielensis, which
has peritrichous flagella, the novel strains described here
show monotrichous flagellation. With respect to cell size,
substrate utilization and polar lipids, however, the novel
strains are more similar to A. kielensis than to H. marina. On
the other hand, the cellular fatty acid content of strains DFL43T and DFL-44 is consistent with a closer relationship to H.
marina than to A. kielensis. In summary, the molecular data
strongly suggest an affiliation of the investigated strains to
the genus Hoeflea. The clear morphological and physiological differences, as well as the presence of photosynthesis reaction-centre genes and pigments, indicate that the
novel isolates are representatives of a separate species, for

which the name Hoeflea phototrophica sp. nov. is proposed.
The type strain is DFL-43T (=DSM 17068T=NCIMB
14078T).

Description of Hoeflea phototrophica sp. nov.
Hoeflea phototrophica (pho.to9tro.phi.ca. Gr. n. phos photos
light; Gr. adj. trophikos nursing, tending or feeding; N.L.
fem. adj. phototrophica referring to the likely ability to use
light for energy generation).
Cells are small rods, 0?3–0?560?7–2?0 mm in size and are
motile by means of single, polarly inserted flagella. Colonies
grown on marine agar 2216 are smooth, flat and may form
an opaque centre and a translucent halo. They are colourless
to slightly beige if grown in the light. Cultures require
microaerobic growth conditions, but do not grow anaerobically. Growth occurs at concentrations of sea salts from
0?5–7?0 %, at temperatures of up to 33 uC (optimum, 31 uC)
and at pH values in the range 6–9. Acetate and malate are
good growth substrates, whereas succinate, fumarate,
lactate, citrate, glutamate, pyruvate, glucose, fructose and
glycerol allow only poor growth; ethanol and methanol are
not used. Yeast extract is required for growth. Gelatin,
starch, alginate and Tween 80 are not decomposed. Nitrate is
not reduced to nitrite or nitrogen. Indole is not formed from
tryptophan. Cells contain bacteriochlorophyll a and a
carotenoid, probably spheroidenone, in small to medium
amounts. The DNA G+C content of the type strain is
59?3 mol%.
The type strain, DFL-43T (=DSM 17068T=NCIMB 14078T),
was isolated from a culture of Prorocentrum lima (dinoflagellates).

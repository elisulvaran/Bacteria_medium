Abstract In biological wastewater treatments, microbial
populations of the so-called activated sludge work together
in the abatement of pollutants. In this work, the metabolic
behavior of the biomass of a lab-scale plant treating industrial pharmaceutical wastewater was investigated through a
metaproteomic approach. The complete treatment process
included a membrane biological reactor (MBR) coupled
with an advanced oxidation process (AOP) for partial
breakdown of non-biodegradable molecules. Proteins from
biomass samples collected pre- and post-AOP application
were investigated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
(2DE), mass spectrometry (MS), and finally identified by
database search. Results showed that most proteins
remained constant between pre- and post-AOP. Methanol
dehydrogenase (MDH) belonging to Hyphomicrobium
zavarzinii appeared as the most constantly expressed protein in the studied consortium. Other identified proteins

Introduction
Biological degradation processes are considered conventional
treatments for sewage since almost a century. Several microbial populations cooperate in the degradation of wastewater
pollutants and represent the main part of activated sludge.
Over the years, different tools were developed to characterize
these microbial consortia [1, 2]. As a first approach, microscopy can offer preliminary indications of the morphology and
physiological status of the biomass, while standard physical
determinations describe the main characteristics of sludge in
terms of water/solid content, settleability, filterability, etc.
Secondly, respirometry gives information about bacterial activity, cell growth, and decay through biomass oxygen consumption. Thirdly, molecular tools can characterize the biomass on the basis of gene sequences, like in fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). Finally, metagenomics delivers data on the metabolic
potential of microorganisms in wastewater treatment plants
(WWTP). Improved understanding of interactions among
microbial consortia in activated sludge requires profound
investigation including functional analysis to optimize
treatment processes. Valuable data on the physiological
and metabolic activity of microorganisms can be obtained
by targeting the entire protein set of a cell, such as in
proteomics. Technical advances in mass spectrometry
(MS) enabled the proteome analysis of complex microbial

C. Salerno et al.

communities in environmental samples such as those of
WWTP [3]. Metaproteomics was successfully applied to
the study of numerous microbial communities from
groundwater samples [4], while it was only recently applied to microbial consortia of biological WWTP, with interesting results [5, 6].
In this work, the metaproteomic approach was applied to
investigate the metabolic behavior of the biomass of a labscale plant treating industrial pharmaceutical wastewater containing residues of nalidixic acid (NAL). The complete treatment process included a membrane biological reactor (MBR)
coupled with an advanced oxidation process (AOP) for partial
breakdown of non-biodegradable molecules. More details and
results of the integrated process are described elsewhere [7, 8].
Biomass samples were collected before and after the AOP
application, and proteins were extracted according to the phenol extraction protocol proposed by Kuhn and colleagues [9].
Proteins extracted in different days during steady operation of
the system were first investigated by qualitative SDS-PAGE
according to Laemmli [10], as shown in Fig. 1. No significant
quality variations were pointed out in protein patterns as a
result of AOP treatment, and interestingly a highly expressed
band of about 65 kDa resulted always present. As better explained in the following, this band was related to the abundance of methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), which was found
to belong to a specific bacterial strain (Hyphomicrobium
zavarzinii). Samples collected on day 58 and day 108, called,
respectively, pre- and post-AOP, were finally chosen for twodimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE):
the first dimension was carried out through isoelectric focusing (IEF) by 18-cm IPG strips pH 4–7 (GE Healthcare), the
second one through SDS-PAGE. Every analysis was performed in triplicate. The amount of total proteins in each

Fig. 1 SDS-PAGE. Steady-state
pre-AOP condition is represented
by days 42, 51, 58. Steady-state
post-AOP condition by the
following days

extracted sample was evaluated through Total Protein Kit,
Micro-Lowry (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) in order to
load the same protein content on each IPG strip. The software
Delta2D™ (Decodon, Greifswald, Germany) was used for
image analysis. 2D gels of pre- and post-AOP samples
showed very limited changes in the protein pattern
(Student’s test, P values <0.05) so that most of the spots appeared unvaried (Fig. 2). For each 2D gel (pre and post AOP),
a high number of 144 spots were manually excised, and 74 of
these were subjected to tryptic digestion and analyzed by
MALDI TOF MS/MS (Ultraflextreme, Bruker Daltonics,
Massachusetts, USA) as described by Kluge and co-workers
[11]. Proteins were identified by searching peptide spectra
with MASCOT (http://www.matrixscience.com) against
NCBInr (version 20140312). Each protein was associated
to a specific spot when its Mowse score was at least 100,
its number of peptides at least 2, and its molecular weight
and isoelectric point were consistent with its position in 2D
gels. If more proteins applied for a spot, the one with the
best parameters was selected (Online Resource 1). Thirtysix spots were reliably identified by MALDI TOF MS/MS.
In order to increase the number of identifications, 21 selected spots among those not identified were additionally
analyzed by nanoHPLC-ESI MS/MS [12], resulting in the
successful identification of four more proteins. Finally, 35
spots whose abundance seemed unvaried (Fig. 2, full arrows) and 5 spots with apparently changing abundance
(dotted arrows and boxed IDs) were identified. Protein
identifications are listed in Table 1, where all proteins were
identified by at least two peptides and in many cases, this
number was higher than 2. For each spot listed in Table 1,
all candidate proteins were also evaluated (i.e., those with
lower scores and number of peptides) as reported in

supplementary Online Resource 1. Moreover, the BUnipept
metaproteomics analysis pipeline^ (Unipept 3.1) was applied to all peptides, and it confirmed the Hyphomicrobium
genus as the most prevalent in the consortium, as shown in
Online Resource 2 [13].
Metaproteome analysis showed that 31 database hits of
identified proteins were taxonomically affiliated to the genus Hyphomicrobium, of whom 17 referred to H.
zavarzinii, 9 to Hyphomicrobium nitrativorans, and 3 to
Hyphomicrobium denitrificans. The 65-kDa band with
high expression in SDS-PAGE corresponded to the larger
and constantly expressed spots in 2D-PAGE identified as
methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) of H. zavarzinii. Also
ethanol dehydrogenase (EDH) belonging to H. zavarzinii
was interestingly found at constant expression levels.
These two important and constant identifications suggest
that the incoming wastewater contained relevant amounts
of methanol and ethanol, so that H. zavarzinii was well
adapted to these substrates and appeared well represented
in the biomass, confirming previous findings for methanolfed biological reactors [14]. The aldehyde-activating protein (AAP) belonging to H. nitrativorans, which presents
the same domain of the formaldehyde-activating enzyme
(FAE) belonging to Methylobacterium extorquens AM1
(KEGG entry W911_13190), was found constant too.
Vorholt and coworkers [15] showed the strong relationship
between the MDH and the FAE describing the reversible
reactions of the FAE pathways as an option to achieve the
anabolism of one carbon compound entering the serine
cycle, useful for biosynthesis or acetyl-CoA production.
The identification of the aldehyde-activating protein
(AAP) belonging to H. nitrativorans also leads to the hypothesis of a metabolic cooperation with the MDH of H.
zavarzinii in the oxidation of methanol.
Furthermore, no differences in the expression of the chaperones GroEL and DnaK were observed in pre- and post-AOP

gels. This suggests that the microbial communities did not
experience severe stress, appearing well adapted to process
conditions including the new by-products formed in the
AOP treatment of effluents. In addition, diverse ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporter permeases and binding
proteins indicated an active transport of nutrients or metabolites. In particular, many studies attributed a primary role to
ABC transporters in the bacterial capability to develop
drug resistance, as it may happen for NAL [16]. As for
the DNA polymerase III subunit beta, despite the wellknown toxic effects of NAL on DNA replication, no significant difference in expression was observed before and
after AOP application, suggesting possible adaptation of
H. zavarzinii. Moreover, a glutamate/glutamine/aspartate/
asparagine ABC transporter of Roseovarius sp. TM1035
resulted as downregulated at the end of the AOP process.
The amino acids transported by this permease are key molecules in nitrogen metabolism. This correlates with the
increased availability of alternative nitrogen compounds
following modifications of NAL (which structurally contains nitrogen) due to the AOP.
In conclusion, the investigation of the microbial consortium through metaproteomics allowed the identification of
the methylotroph H. zavarzinii with its high expression of
MDH as the most important player in the studied system.
Furthermore, the metaproteomic approach also provides indications that are useful for understanding the metabolic pathways of microbial communities. The consequent identification of critical biochemical steps could lead to relevant improvements in the efficiency of industrial wastewater treatments. Further studies should address different types of wastewater treatment and different analytical approaches (including
the less labor-intensive gel-free methodologies and new algorithms for the analysis of peptide sequences [13, 17, 18]) and
could open new perspectives in the functional characterization
of complex microbial consortia.

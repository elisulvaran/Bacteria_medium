Hyphomicrobium sp. strain MC1 is an aerobic methylotroph originally isolated from industrial sewage. This
prosthecate bacterium was the first strain reported to grow with chloromethane as the sole carbon and energy
source. Its genome, consisting of a single 4.76-Mb chromosome, is the first for a chloromethane-degrading
bacterium to be formally reported.
predicted open reading frames (ORFs), 947 (20%) have close
homologs (⬎80% amino acid identity over ⬎80% of protein
length, almost all of them in synteny) in Hyphomicrobium denitrificans ATCC 51888, whose genome sequence has been determined (NC_014313) (4).
Genes encoding enzymes and proteins for oxidation of
methanol (mxa) and methylamine (mgs and mgd [5, 7] but not
mau genes) were identified, together with proteins and enzymes involved in pyrroloquinoline quinone synthesis and tetrahydrofolate- and tetrahydromethanopterin-linked pathways.
Genes for complete serine and ethylmalonyl coenzyme A pathways (1) for carbon assimilation were identified. The genome
of strain MC1 also encodes a complete glycolysis pathway and
a closed tricarboxylic acid cycle, but no genes for the glyoxylate
shunt (isocitrate lyase and malate synthase) were detected. Six
terminal oxidases of different types were identified. Unlike in
H. denitrificans ATCC 51888, genes for N2 fixation, a complete
uptake hydrogenase gene cluster, and gene systems for both
assimilative (nas) and dissimilative (nar) reduction of nitrate,
ammonia and nitrate/nitrite transport, a putative nitrate-inducible formate dehydrogenase, an alkane sulfonate oxidation and
transport system, and an acetone carboxylase (acxRABC) cluster (12) were detected. In contrast, the dichloromethane dehalogenation genes (dcmRABC) (10) allowing H. denitrificans
ATCC 51888 to grow on DCM were not found in strain MC1.
Hyphomicrobium sp. strain MC1 thus emerges as a promising model for investigating the degradation of halogenated
pollutants in the context of methylotrophic metabolism using
genomic information (16) and for studies of morphological and
metabolic features supporting bacterial growth under nutrientscarce conditions.
Nucleic acid sequence accession number. The Hyphomicrobium sp. strain MC1 genome sequence was deposited in
GenBank/EMBL under accession number FQ859181.

Strains of the genus Hyphomicrobium originally attracted
interest for their distinctive prosthecae and atypical complex
growth cycle (9). Strains of this genus are ubiquitous but were
detected in wastewater treatment plants in particular, and often under denitrifying conditions (3, 8). Following the description of strain MC1 (6), several chloromethane-degrading Hyphomicrobium strains were isolated from various aquatic and
soil environments, and most recently also from the surfaces
of plant leaves (11). Strain MC1 features the consecutive
cmuBCA gene arrangement; these genes encode chloromethane dehalogenase, which has been found in all aerobic chloromethane-degrading bacteria characterized so far with the exception of Methylobacterium extorquens CM4, from which
chloromethane dehalogenase was purified (13) and in which
regulation of chloromethane dehalogenase expression was investigated (14).
The assembled genome sequence of Hyphomicrobium sp.
strain MC1 was obtained using a mix of sequencing technologies. A mate-paired 454 library with an 8-kb insert size
was constructed (version Titanium), and 559,691 reads
(173,407,941 bp; approximately 36⫻ coverage) were assembled
using Newbler (version 2.3, release 091027_1459). Assembly
validation was made via Consed (www.phrap.org), and 129
PCRs between contigs were performed and sequenced for gap
closure. For quality assessment, a total of 25,299,825 Illumina
36-bp reads were mapped onto the whole genome sequence
using SOAP (http://soap.genomics.org.cn) (2), allowing us to
correct potential base errors and confirming the final closed
circular 4,757,528-bp assembly. Sequence annotation and comparative genome analysis are under way using the MicroScope
platform at Genoscope (15).
Based on the 16S rRNA sequence of its single rRNA
operon, strain MC1 appears to be most closely related to
Hyphomicrobium facile subspecies type strains. Of its 4,679

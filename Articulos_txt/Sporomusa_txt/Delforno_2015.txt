The objective of this study was to evaluate the removal of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) from commercial laundry wastewater using an expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor with two speciﬁc LAS
loading rates (SLLRs), 1.0 and 2.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1. The biomass was characterized using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S Ion Tag sequencing. Higher LAS removal (92.9%) was observed
in association with an SLLR of 1.0 mg LAS gVS1 d1 than with an SLLR of 2.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1 (58.6%). A
relationship between the S2 concentration in the efﬂuent and the surfactant removal efﬁciency was
observed. This result is indicative of the inhibition of LAS-removing microbiota at S2 concentrations
greater than 20 mg S L1. By using DGGE, microbial stratiﬁcation was observed in the reactor in association with granule size, even though the reactor is considered to be a completely mixed regime. The
RDP-classiﬁer identiﬁed 175 genera, 33 of which were related to LAS degradation.

1. Introduction
Surfactants are one of the most versatile products. Their importance can be seen by the values in the global market (US$ 26.8 billion) and annual production (14,630 thousand tons) in 2012. The
Brazilian market in 2012 reached US$ 1.5 billion with annual production of 522 thousand tons. Among all surfactants, the anionic
surfactants receive special attention due to the high global (2942
thousand tons) and Brazilian (293 thousand tons) production, representing annual prices of US$ 7.5 billion and US$ 0.75 billion,
respectively (Frost and Sullivan, 2013 apud Bain & Company and
GasEnergy, 2014).

Linear alkylbenzene sulfonate is the most important anionic
surfactant, with large worldwide production due to low-cost production and excellent properties. Because of its intense use, LAS
can be found in domestic sewage (1–18 mg L1) and laundry
wastewater (17–1024 mg L1; Braga and Varesche, 2014;
Delforno et al., 2014). Therefore, previous studies have reported
several problems associated with inappropriate disposal of
wastewater contaminated with LAS, including dispersing pollution,
foaming in rivers, oxygen diffusion problems, inhibition of
microorganisms with regard to natural depuration and others
(Garcia et al., 2005). To minimize these problems, certain studies
have focused on LAS removal using physical–chemical treatment
(Ge et al., 2004; Sostar-Turk et al., 2005) and anaerobic reactors
(Braga and Varesche, 2014; de Oliveira et al., 2010; Delforno
et al., 2014; Okada et al., 2014).
Accordingly, previous studies evaluated the LAS removal in
laundry wastewater using ﬂuidized bed reactors (FBR) (Braga and
Varesche, 2011), expanded granular sludge bed reactors (EGSB)

38

(Delforno et al., 2014) and up-ﬂow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASB) (Okada et al., 2014).
In the FBR and EGSB reactors, the authors used inﬂuent supplementation (e.g., vitamins, co-substrates, or solutions of macro and
micronutrients), whereas, in the UASB reactor, the authors operated without supplementation. In UASB reactor, Okada et al.
(2014), noted that it is feasible the LAS removal in commercial
laundry wastewater without supplementary feeding, only supplementation with buffering agent (sodium bicarbonate). The authors
aforementioned observed that the concentration of volatile fatty
acids and others compounds present in the laundry wastewater
can support the microbial activity.
In addition, studies have been applied LAS inﬂuent concentration range from 9.5 ± 3.0 to 23.9 ± 5.0 mg L1 in FBR (Braga and
Varesche, 2011) and around 10.0 mg L1 in EGSB and UASB reactor
(Delforno et al., 2014; Okada et al., 2014). The higher removal rate
was 82% and the lower was 68% for UASB and FBR, respectively.
Therefore, this study investigated the removal of LAS in commercial laundry wastewater with two speciﬁc LAS loading rates
(SLLRs), 1.0 and 2.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1, in an EGSB reactor (12.0
and 29 mg LAS L1 in the inﬂuent, respectively) without supplementary feeding. The increase of SLLR was to evaluate the changes
in microbial community under higher LAS concentration associate
with laundry wastewater without supplementary feeding.
The biomass was characterized using two techniques: PCR–
DGGE (polymerase chain reaction–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and high-throughput sequencing. The objective for
DGGE was to determine whether a possible microbial stratiﬁcation
along the reactor was present, and the goal of the high-throughput
sequencing (Ion Torrent Platform) was to identify the microorganisms involved probably in LAS degradation.
2. Methods
2.1. EGSB – expanded granular sludge bed reactor
The reactor consisted of an acrylic apparatus with a volume of
1.40 L, a height of 1.0 m and a diameter of 0.04 m. At the upper
end, there was a device to separate the solid, liquid and gas phases,
and at the base, there was a distributor of ﬂow. The up-ﬂow velocity was constant (4 m h1) to generate efﬂuent recirculation. Six
sampling points were installed along the bed of the reactor, and
one was installed on the phase separator. During the operation,
the reactor was maintained at a mesophilic condition of 30 °C in
a climatic chamber and with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of
38 h. With the purpose of ensuring anaerobic systems, two procedures were adopted: the use of a water seal and the use of a siphon
at the outlet of the system, which prevented the entry of oxygen
via hose efﬂuent. The reactor was inoculated with a granular
sludge (7.0 gTVS L1) obtained from a full-scale UASB plant treating efﬂuent from a poultry slaughterhouse.
2.2. Experimental setup
The EGSB reactor was operated in three stages. Stage I consisted
of the reactivation of microorganisms because the granular sludge
was kept under refrigeration (4 °C). Thus, in this stage, the reactor
was fed with a synthetic medium (Touzel and Albagnac, 1983;
Angelidaki et al., 1990). In Stages II and III, the synthetic medium
was replaced with diluted laundry wastewater (only the sodium
bicarbonate was kept to maintain a neutral pH) at two speciﬁc
LAS loading rates (SLLRs): 1.0 ± 0.3 mg LAS gTVS1 d1 (Stage II –
12.0 ± 3.0 mg LAS L1 inﬂuent) and 2.7 ± 0.7 mg LAS gTVS1 d1
(Stage III – 28.8 ± 6.4 mg LAS L1 inﬂuent). Several studies have
been evaluated anaerobic reactor with inﬂuent LAS concentration

range from 10 to 15 mg L1 (de Oliveira et al., 2010; Delforno
et al., 2012, 2014; Okada et al., 2014). In most cases, when the
inﬂuent concentration exceeds these concentrations the reactor
becomes unstable. However, due to the satisfactory results
obtained in Stage II, the concentration of LAS inﬂuent was doubled
to evaluate the microbial response under higher LAS concentration.
It is noteworthy that the LAS concentration in the Stage III is below
of inhibition concentration (50–100 mg LAS L1) as determined by
Angelidaki et al. (2004), Garcia et al. (2005).
2.3. Synthetic medium
The reactor was fed with a modiﬁed mineral medium (an
adjusted MgCl2 concentration of 25 mg L1; Angelidaki et al.,
1990), vitamins (Touzel and Albagnac, 1983), sodium bicarbonate
(400 mg L1) and a mixture of co-substrates, which consisted of
ethanol (250 mg COD L1), methanol (250 mg COD L1) and yeast
extract (250 mg COD L1).
2.4. Laundry wastewater
The wastewater was collected from a commercial laundry
located in São Carlos, SP, Brazil. During the washing process two
compounds were added, (i) detergents and (ii) neutralizeracidulant. The detergent composition consisted of LAS, nonionic
surfactants, builders, bleaching agents, enzymes, fragrance,
neutralizers and alkalizing agents (sodium hydroxide). The
neutralizer-acidulant consisted of sodium sulfate, sodium
metabisulﬁte and an alkaline vehicle. Thus, the source of LAS was
one compound and the source of sulfate was another compound.
It is noteworthy that all compounds were added manually by
laundry employees, with low precision. The wastewater was
collected after the ﬁrst rinse in 10 or 20 L high-density polyurethane bottles, and the bottles were stored at a temperature of
4 °C. After each collection, the commercial laundry wastewater
was characterized. In addition, due to the high concentration of
LAS in the wastewater and the inhibitory concentration for
methanogenic process, the laundry wastewater was diluted in
public water supply as a function of LAS concentration determined
in each stage. Thus, the dilution during the Stage II was around 1:9
(laundry wastewater: public water supply) while at Stage III was
around 1:5 (laundry wastewater: public water supply).
2.5. Physical chemical analysis
Analyses of pH (4500), total solids (2540D), total dissolved
sulﬁde (4500-S2-.D) and chemical oxygen demand (COD; 5220D)
were determined according to the Standard Methods for
Examination of Water and Wastewater (APHA-AWWA-WPCF,
2005).
Nitrate and sulfate were quantiﬁed by ion chromatography
using a Dionex ICS-5000 with IonPAC AS23 (4 mm) and an eluent
of Na2CO3/NaHCO3 (1 mL min1). The samples were previously
puriﬁed in a C-18 column (ChromabondÒ C18ec) to remove
surfactants.
Volatile fatty acids (VFAs), including caproic, valeric, isovaleric,
butyric, isobutyric, propionic, acetic, formic, lactic, succinic, malic
and citric acids, were quantiﬁed by HPLC using a Shimadzu system
(Controller SCL10AVP, Pump LC-10ADVP, Oven CTO-20A and UV
detector SCL10AVP) with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad;
Penteado et al., 2013).
LAS was quantiﬁed by HPLC using a Shimadzu system
(SCL10AVP, LC-10ADVP, CTO-10A and RF-10AXL) with a
reversed-phase C8 column (Supelco) and ﬂuorescence detector
(Duarte et al., 2006) .

2.6. Biological analysis

3. Results and discussion

The analysis of the microbial community was performed by
PCR–DGGE (domain Bacteria) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA
gene. The analysis by PCR–DGGE was performed in two ways:
(i) the ﬁrst aimed to compare the microbial community of the
inoculum and the end of Stages II and III in the reactor. For this
purpose, homogeneous samples of the sludge blanket (SB)
(Stages II and III) and the phase separator (PS) (Stages II and III)
were sampled. (ii) The second method aimed to evaluate the
community at different sampling points in the sludge blanket
and the phase separator, thus verifying the existence of a possible
microbial stratiﬁcation along the reactor (only Stage III). For this
purpose, samples were taken from the ﬂow distributor (P1), three
sludge blanket sites (P2, P3, and P4) and the phase separator (P5).
For the phylogenetic characterization of the Bacteria domain,
homogeneous samples were taken from the phase separator and
the sludge blanket at the end of Stages II and III. Thus, four samples
were sequenced using an Ion 318™ Chip Kit v2 400 bp.

3.1. Reactor performance

2.6.1. DNA extraction
Total DNA extraction for PCR–DGGE and 16S rRNA sequencing
was performed using a modiﬁed phenol–chloroform protocol
described by Grifﬁths et al. (2000). The DNA quality was assessed
by a standard of 260/280 nm > 1.8, as measured by an ND-2000
spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Inc., Wilmington, DE) and agarose
gel electrophoresis.

2.6.2. PCR–DGGE
PCR–DGGE was performed as described in Duarte et al. (2010).
For the Bacteria domain, primers 968F (with a clamp GC) and
1392R (Nübel et al., 1996) were used. DGGE banding patterns were
analyzed using BioNumerics V.2.5. The similarity coefﬁcients were
determined according to the Jaccard coefﬁcient, and the dendrogram was determined by an unweighted pair group method with
an arithmetic average (UPGMA) algorithm.

2.6.3. 16S rRNA Ion Tag sequencing
The sequencing was performed at the GenOne Biotechnologies
enterprise (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) using 400-base chemistry and
the Ion Torrent PGM technology (Life Technologies), speciﬁcally
the 318 Chip. The rRNA genes were ampliﬁed using a primer set
that ﬂanked the V4 hypervariable region: primers 577F (50 -AYTG
GGYDTAAAGNG-30 ) and 924R (50 -CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGT-30 ),
generating an ampliﬁed fragment with an average length of
347 bp. According to Neefs et al. (1990), the 16S rDNA gene is
divided into nine variable regions (V1–V9), the V2, V4 and V6
regions are the most used to phylogenetic afﬁliation. In addition,
Liu et al. (2007) observed low error rate for V2 and V4 region.
Using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) RDP’s Pipeline
(http://pyro.cme.msu.edu/index.jsp; Cole et al., 2009), the
sequences were processed as described in Delforno et al. (2014).
The RDP-Classiﬁer was used for the taxonomic classiﬁcation of
sequences representative of each OTU. The conﬁdence threshold
adopted was 80% for genus and 50% for other taxonomic levels
(phylum-family). Alfa (Chao1, Shannon, Simpson and Dominance)
diversity was quantiﬁed using Past software. The sequences were
submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (http://www.ebi.
ac.uk) under the accession numbers ERS629278 (Stage II – PS),
ERS629279 (Stage II – SB), ERS629280 (Stage III – SB) and
ERS629281 (Stage III – PS). The project accession number is
PRJEB8003.

In the total, ﬁve samples were taken to analyze the
composition of the laundry wastewater (two samples during the
Stage II and three samples during the Stage III), the average values
found were 119 ± 53 mg LAS L1, 1582 ± 455 mg COD L1 and
205 ± 104 mg S L1 (sulfate). The pH ranged from 9.6 to 10.7, and
the VFA average was 442 ± 556 mg COD L1. The primary acids
detected were lactic acid (168.6 ± 174.8 mg L1) and malic acid
(153.6 ± 326.7 mg L1). The laundry wastewater analyzed by
Braga and Varesche (2014) possessed similar levels of LAS
(162 ± 244 mg LAS L1) and COD (1710 ± 968 mg COD L1) but a
lower sulfate concentration (7.0 ± 6.4 mg S L1) and a lower pH
(5.6 ± 0.9). Interestingly, Braga and Varesche (2014) obtained a
peak LAS concentration of 1024 mg L1, whereas the present
results only reached 202 mg LAS L1. Delforno et al., 2014,
who analyzed seven samples of laundry wastewater from a
commercial laundry located in São Carlos, SP, Brazil, obtained
similar values of 181 ± 82 mg LAS L1, 1603 ± 692 mg COD L1
and 124 ± 74 mg S L1 of sulfate. Moreover, the pH was basic and
ranged from 9.0 to 10.0. Because of the high concentration of
LAS, the laundry wastewater was diluted with a public water
supply to obtain an inﬂuent LAS concentration range of 12.0–
28.8 mg L1 (as a function of each stage), which is below the inhibitory level for anaerobic processes (50 mg LAS L1; Angelidaki
et al., 2004).
Stage I (26 days) was characterized by microbial reactivation
because the granular sludge was refrigerated. The speciﬁc organic
loading rate (SOLR) was 69 ± 9 mg COD gVS1 d1 (inﬂuent COD
concentration of 755 ± 277 mg L1), and the removal efﬁciency
was 89 ± 19% (Table 1).
In Stage II (only laundry wastewater by 65 days), the SOLR
decreased to 21 ± 9 mg COD gVS1 d1. The inﬂuent COD was

However, with the beginning of Stage III (the 91st day of operation), an increase in sulﬁde concentrations in the efﬂuent was
observed (<20 mg S L1), and the LAS removal efﬁciency dropped
below 40% (Fig. 1). The increase in sulﬁde concentrations was
due to the increase in laundry wastewater input into the reactor.
Accordingly, the sulfate concentration increased (Table 1), resulting in a higher concentration of sulﬁde generated by the sulfate
reduction.
Although increasing concentrations of LAS can be connected to
the reduction removal efﬁciency (Delforno et al., 2012), a high
removal of LAS was observed during a period of Stage III (days
151–185) in which the sulﬁde levels were lower. During days
151–185, the LAS removal was 85% in association with a sulﬁde
concentration of 1 ± 2 mg S L1. During days 91–150 and 186–217,

221 ± 81 mg L1 with a removal efﬁciency of 61 ± 15%. The COD
was related to volatile organic acids, surfactants, ﬁbrous material
and recalcitrant compounds present in the wastewater; thus, the
lower COD removal was due to a portion of the material that
was not readily degradable.
The speciﬁc LAS loading rate (SLLR) in Stage II was
1.0 ± 0.3 mg LAS gVS1 d1 (12.3 ± 3.2 mg LAS L1 inﬂuent), and
the average removal was 92.9 ± 10.3%. It is noteworthy that the
feeding of EGSB reactor without synthetic medium (only laundry
wastewater) did not result in system instability.
Delforno et al. (2014), operating an EGSB reactor with a similar
SLLR (1.0 ± 0.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1) of laundry wastewater and SOLR
(71 ± 13 mg COD gVS1 d1) of synthetic medium, obtained an
average of 76.4 ± 18.1%. Thus, the absence of inﬂuent supplementation (present study) showed an increase around 15% comparing to
Delforno et al. (2014) which supplemented with synthetic
medium.
Probably, the SOLR was the key parameter for obtaining high
surfactant removal rates with values of 21 ± 11 and 71 ± 13 mg
COD gVS1 d1 for the present study (Stage II) and Delforno et al.
(2012), respectively.
In UASB reactor Okada et al. (2013) for an SOLR of
30 ± 1 mg COD gVS1 d1, the LAS removal efﬁciency was 76%,
whereas for 70–180 mg COD gVS1 d1, the removal values ranged
from 37% to 53%. The organic components that comprised the SOLR
were methanol, ethanol and yeast extract in the synthetic medium.
Thus, Okada et al. (2013) veriﬁed that decreasing SOLR increased
LAS removal.
At Stage III, the SOLR was similar to Stage II (21 ± 11 mg
COD gVS1 d1) but the COD removal was 48 ± 19%. The difference
between Stage II and Stage III was due to the COD related to sulﬁde
(Stage II: 1.76 ± 2.33 mg S L1; Stage III: 20.2 ± 25.1 mg S L1). The
SLLR was 2.7 ± 0.7 mg LAS gSTV1 d1 (LAS inﬂuent: 28.8 ± 6.4
mg L1), and the LAS removal rate decreased to 58.6 ± 25.8%. A
possible relationship was observed between increases in the
concentration of S2 in the efﬂuent (due to sulfate in the laundry
wastewater) and decreases in surfactant removal. During Stage II,
the sulﬁde efﬂuent concentration was not higher than
10 mg S L1, and the LAS removal was greater than 70%.

the sulﬁde concentrations were 9 ± 6 and 62 ± 25 mg S L1, and the
LAS removal rates were 50% and 30%, respectively (for LAS inﬂuent
concentrations of 32 ± 7 and 30 ± 2 mg LAS L1, respectively).
Therefore, the sulﬁde levels in the reactor were related to the LAS
removal rate (Fig. 2).
Although the anaerobic microbiota can support high S2 concentrations (100–150 mg L1, at a pH of 6.8; Speece, 1983), the
results demonstrate that the microbiota involved with LAS removal
do not thrive in concentrations greater than 20 mg L1. In other
words, these LAS-removing microbiota exhibit a low tolerance to
S2. In actuality, this susceptibility could be the result of many factors, such as competition for the same substrates between
sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and the LAS-removing microbiota,
non-competitive inhibition caused by SRB-generated sulﬁde
and/or toxicity of S2. These results represent a new challenge in
the application of anaerobic reactors for the removal of LAS present
in laundry wastewater with high sulfate concentrations.
According to the mass balance of the total amount of LAS added
to the reactor (4460 mg LAS), 7% and 2% were adsorbed to the biomass in the sludge blanket and phase separator, respectively.
Biological degradation accounted for 52%, whereas adsorption
and biological removal removed 61%. The mass balance was realized at the end of the reactor operation (Stage II and Stage III),
and Stage III showed low LAS removal rates, resulting in a decrease
in the percentages of the mass balance.
3.2. PCR/DGGE analyses
Based on the biomass DGGE proﬁle taken along the reactor
(Fig. 3C and D), the bacterial populations differed as a function of
the sampling site. Because the reactor is considered completely
mixed (i.e., a high ratio of recirculation ﬂow to feed ﬂow), the
nutrient distribution does not differ along the reactor (Seghezzo
et al., 1998). However, stratiﬁcation was observed in relation to

41

the size of the granules. Larger and denser granules were observed
at the base of the reactor, and lower density granules were
observed in the upper region of the sludge blanket. In the phase
separator (P5), no granules were found, only ﬂocculent biomass
attached to the acrylic. The P4 biomass was 78% similar to the
phase separator sample (P5), both of which lack granular structure.
A 73% similarity existed between the populations of P2 and P3,
both of which contained well-deﬁned granules. However, a similarity coefﬁcient of only 30% existed between these two groups
(i.e., biomass structure in the form of granules (P2 and P3) and ﬂocculent material (P5 and P4).
The biomass of the phase separator region P5 and P4 exhibited
lower similarity coefﬁcients (<34%) when compared to the biomass
from the inoculum. These regions likely experienced the largest
changes to the original biomass. According McHugh et al. (2003),
two of the main advantages of the microbial granule arrangement
are the collective defense with regard to toxic compounds and
optimization of the survival of microbial populations. For this reason, the absence of the granular structures results in greater susceptibility of the microbiota to environmental changes. In the
biomass DGGE proﬁles taken at the end of Stages II, III and the
inoculum, large-amplitude variations in similarity values and clustering with the operation stages were observed. The highest similarity coefﬁcient (60%) was between the inoculum and Stage II
biomass sludge blanket.
The biomass of the ﬂow distribution (P1) was 52% similar to the
points P2 and P3 (granular biomass) and <40% similar to the points
P4 and P5 (ﬂocculent biomass). This pattern was likely due to the
presence of a dead zone with fragmented granules.
3.3. Microbial composition
Using the Ion Torrent PGM technology for massive sequencing,
it was obtained 396,818 sequences of 16S rRNA genes (4 samples;

Table 2). During the processing of sequences, 216,998 sequences
were removed due to the low quality of the bases (Phred > 20),
lengths less than 200 bp, chimeras or ambiguous bases. Thus,
56.6% of the total sequences were discarded. Many of the
sequences were removed due to formation of a dimer between
the forward and reverse primers, resulting in a fragment of approximately 35 bp (data not shown). After processing, the average size
of the sequenced fragments was 313–329 bp.
By analyzing of coverage (using the Good formula), it was determined that 95–96% of all the microbial communities were
accessed. Furthermore, the analyses of the rarefaction curves were
used to infer that the phylum taxonomic level (80% similarity) and
the number of sequences obtained were sufﬁcient to represent all
the diversity in the biomass (Supplementary Fig. 1). Stabilization
occurred after 10,000 sequences. However, the rarefaction curves
demonstrated that even with a large number of sequences, it was
not possible to access the entire diversity at the genus (95%) and
species (97%) level. Stabilization of the rarefaction curves did not
occur at the genus and species levels.
The values of richness estimators (Chao1) and rarefaction ranged
from 3072 to 6214 and 2268–4623, respectively. The highest values
of Chao1 and rarefaction were obtained in Stage II with an SLLR of
1.0 ± 0.3 mg LAS gSTV1 d1, whereas the lowest values were
obtained in Stage III with an SLLR of 2.7 ± 0.7 mg LAS gSTV1 d1.
The inhibition of microbiota likely occurred due to the SLLR.
Similar results were obtained in the DGGE analysis, which showed
large changes in the populations in the biomass of Stage III.
The Shannon diversity index yielded values greater than 6.0 for
all samples, which indicate high diversity. Furthermore, the
observed Simpson values (1-D) near 1 indicate high diversity and
equitable distribution.
For the comparison of the four samples, the Bray–Curtis index
was used (Fig. 4A). The biomass grouped according to the operation stages of the reactor. This pattern was observed for the biomass in Stage II (PS, SB) and Stage III (PS, SB), which exhibited
similarity values of 25% and 45%, respectively. With increased
operation time in the reactors, the similarity between the biomass
of different regions increased. Furthermore, a similarity value of
only 10% was observed between the biomass of Stage II and
Stage III, a result of the increased concentration of LAS and reactor
operation time. By means of the presence/absence of genera in the
Venn diagram, it was determined that 22% of the identiﬁed genera
were present in all four samples. In contrast, 5–11% of the genera
were unique to each sample (Fig. 4B).
By using the RDP-Classiﬁer, over 95% of the sequences were
classiﬁed at the phylum level. At the genera level, the percentage
ranged from 16% to 75% of the classiﬁed sequences. Among the
major phyla, the Proteobacteria phylum represented greater than

20% (relative abundance) of the samples from Stage III and 65–
70% of the sludge blanket and phase separator samples. Except
for the sample from Stage II SB, in which the phylum
Bacteroidetes was higher, the phylum Proteobacteria was the most
abundant (Fig. 5A).
The 20 most abundant genera, excluding unclassiﬁed ones, represented 99% (Stage II – SB), 84% (Stage II – PS), 93% (Stage III – SB)
and 95% (Stage III – PS) of the relative abundances (date not
shown). Including the unclassiﬁed sequences, the values were
15% (Stage II – SB), 24% (Stage II – PS), 50% (Stage III – SB) and
71% (Stage III – PS). Genera such as Geobacter, Syntrophobacter,
Smithella, Phenylobacterium and Legionella were found in four samples (Fig. 5B). From these ﬁve genera, only Geobacter was directly
related to the degradation of LAS and/or its intermediaries because
this type of Bacteria uses aromatic compounds, such as benzene
and toluene, as a carbon source. Geobacter genus is a strict anaerobe and has the metabolic capacity to perform b-oxidation, a step
in the LAS degradation (Brenner et al., 2005).
3.3.1. Microbial composition regarding to LAS degradation
In the total, 175 genera were obtained. Of these, 33 genera, representing 2.0–19.6% of the total sequences obtained from the samples, were related to the degradation of LAS and/or aromatic
compounds. Higher percentages were obtained in Stage III (15.9–
19.6% for 2.7 ± 0.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1), which the SLLR was higher
than in Stage II (2.0–6.1% for 1.0 ± 0.3 mg LAS gVS1 d1).
However, during the stage III the ﬂuctuations of sulﬁde levels
resulted in a decrease of LAS removal. But, the speciﬁc LAS removal
rate (SLRR) increased from 0.9 ± 0.3 mg gVS1 d1 (Stage II) to
1.6 ± 0.8 mg gVS1 d1 (Stage III) supporting the higher percentage
of microorganism related to the degradation of LAS and/or aromatic compounds. It is noteworthy that the SLRR between Stage
II and Stage III showed statistical difference (ANOVA and the post
hoc Tukey, p < 0.05).
Among the analyzed sequences, 0.16–10.79% of the sequences
were related to the following genera that perform desulfonation
reactions: Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Comamonas, Desulfovibrio,
Hydrogenophaga and Pseudomonas. Of the obtained sequences,
0.36–12.30% were related to the following genera with the metabolic capacity to perform b-oxidation: Azoarcus, Geobacter,
Parvibaculum, Pseudomonas, Rhodopseudomonas, Synergistes and
Syntrophomonas. Of the obtained sequences, 0.01–9.80% were
related to two genera (Pseudomonas and Parvibaculum) with the
metabolic capacity to perform x-oxidation reactions. Only
Pseudomonas has the ability to perform both b- and x-oxidation,
in addition to desulfonation. Thus, Pseudomonas plays a necessary
role in the microbial consortium that mineralizes LAS (Brenner
et al., 2005).

Fig. 4. Bray–Curtis index (A). Venn diagram of the presence and absence of genera (B).

In the four samples, 14 identiﬁed genera were related to anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds: Acinetobacter,
Comamonas, Desulfobulbus, Desulfomonile, Geobacter, Geothrix,
Holophaga, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhodopseudomonas,
Sporomusa, Stenotrophomonas, Sulfuritalea and Syntrophorhabdus.
With the exception of Sulfuritalea, the other genera have been
identiﬁed in another studies related to LAS degradation (de
Oliveira et al., 2009; Duarte et al., 2010; Delforno et al., 2012;
Duarte et al., 2010). This result shows the existence of a microbiological core in common among the four samples and, consequently,
the role of these microorganisms in LAS degradation. Probably, the
presence of Sulfuritalea genus was favored to sulfur and aromatic
compounds. This genus grows chemolithoautotrophically under
anoxic conditions by the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds
and hydrogen. Moreover, this genus cans growth in heterotrophic
conditions using organic acids and aromatic compounds such as
benzoate (Kojima and Fukui, 2011).
The microbial community inside the reactor can be affected due
to several reasons. Some of these reasons are the composition of
the support material, for example in FBR (de Oliveira et al.,
2009), presence of toxic compounds (sulfophenyl carboxylic acids
– SPC) during the process of LAS biodegradation (Lara-Martin
et al., 2010) and presence of toxic compounds in the laundry
wastewater (Braga and Varesche, 2014). In addition, metabolized
byproducts from compounds present in the laundry wastewater
can represent one more factor toxic to microbial community. For
example, sulﬁde generated from laundry wastewater rich in sulfate
as previously discussed (Section 3.1 – reactor performance).
On the other hand, there are compounds in laundry wastewater
which favor the degradation of the LAS such as sequestrants (e.g.,
EDTA) due to decrease the amount of LAS adsorbed in the biomass
(Delforno et al., 2014; Okada et al., 2014).

Additionally, the reactor was subjected to high inﬂuent sulfate concentrations (30–54 mg S L1). Therefore, although there
is evidence in the literature that the microbial community may
have been affected by the presence of toxic compounds during
the LAS biodegradation or toxic compounds present in the laundry wastewater, probably, the main modiﬁer of LAS biodegradation and microbial community were metabolized byproducts
from sulfate (eg., sulﬁde). This conclusion is supported by physical–chemical results (Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2) and the several
sulfur cycle genera found which will be discussed below.
3.3.2. Microbial composition regarding to sulfur cycle
Due to the high concentration of sulfate in the wastewater
(205 ± 104 mg S L1), genera associated with the sulfur cycle were
highly abundant (4.8%–55.3%; Supplementary Fig. 2). The relative
abundance of these genera increased between Stage II (SB-4.8%
and PS-6.2%) and Stage III (SB-20.3 and PS-55.3%).
The genera related to sulfate reduction include Desulfatirhabdium,
Desulfocapsa, Desulfomicrobium, Desulfomonile, Desulforhabdus,
Desulfovibrio and Syntrophobacter. Of these, certain genera
(Desulfatirhabdium, Desulfomicrobium, Desulfomonile and Desulfovibrio)
are related to aromatic compound degradation and have already
been identiﬁed in previous studies (Cook et al., 1998; Brenner
et al., 2005; Duarte et al., 2010; Delforno et al., 2014). The relative
abundance in Stage II ranged from 0.01% to 0.30% in association
with an inﬂuent sulfate concentration of 29.2 ± 10.1 mg S L1;
whereas the relative abundance in the Stage III ranged from
3.54% to 4.75% in association with an inﬂuent sulfate concentration
of 53.8 ± 17.2 mg S L1.
In addition, it was observed speciﬁc microbiota related to
sulﬁde and elementary sulfur (Brenner et al., 2005). These genera
include Bosea; Desulfuromonas; Petrimonas and Sulfurovum. None

of these genera are related to the LAS degradation and/or its
intermediaries; however, they do perform important functions
associated with reactor stability.
The highest relative abundances are associated with higher sulﬁde concentrations (Stage II: 1.8 ± 2.3 mg S L1, 0.05%; Stage III:
20.2 ± 25.1 mg S L1, 46.8%). Moreover, the Sulfurovum genus is a
chemolithoautotroph that uses elemental sulfur or thiosulfate as
an electron donor and oxygen and nitrate as electron acceptors,
with CO2 as the carbon source (Kleinsteuber et al., 2008). A high
relative abundance of this genus was observed in the region of
the phase separator in Stage III (40.3%). This region is favorable
due to its greater susceptibility to the presence of oxygen, availability of CO2 and elemental sulfur.
4. Conclusions
The highest LAS removal was observed for an SLLR of
1.0 mg LAS gVS1 d1
(92.9 ± 10.3%).
The
higher
SLLR,
2.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1, resulted in a lower LAS removal efﬁciency
(58.6 ± 25.8%). Based on the observations, the primary factor
responsible for this lower removal efﬁciency was the increased sulﬁde levels in the reactor due to higher sulfate reduction activity.
S2 concentrations less than 20 mg S L1 were associated with high
LAS removal rates, even for an SLLR of 2.7 mg LAS gVS1 d1. The

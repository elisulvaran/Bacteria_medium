Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains are corrinoid-auxotrophic Bacteria and axenic
cultures that require vitamin B12 (CN-Cbl) to conserve energy via organohalide respiration. Cultures of D. mccartyi strains BAV1, GT and FL2
grown with limiting amounts of 1 mg l21 CN-Cbl quickly depleted
CN-Cbl, and reductive dechlorination of polychlorinated ethenes was
incomplete leading to vinyl chloride (VC) accumulation. In contrast, the
same cultures amended with 25 mg l21 CN-Cbl exhibited up to 2.3-fold
higher dechlorination rates, 2.8–9.1-fold increased growth yields, and
completely consumed growth-supporting chlorinated ethenes. To explore
whether known cobamide-producing microbes supply Dehalococcoides with
the required corrinoid cofactor, co-culture experiments were performed
with the methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri strain Fusaro and two acetogens, Sporomusa ovata and Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1, as Dehalococcoides
partner populations. During growth with H2/CO2, M. barkeri axenic cultures
produced 4.2 + 0.1 mg l21 extracellular cobamide (factor III), whereas the
Sporomusa cultures produced phenolyl- and p-cresolyl-cobamides. Neither
factor III nor the phenolic cobamides supported Dehalococcoides reductive
dechlorination activity suggesting that M. barkeri and the Sporomusa sp.
cannot fulfil Dehalococcoides’ nutritional requirements. Dehalococcoides
dechlorination activity and growth occurred in M. barkeri and Sporomusa
sp. co-cultures amended with 10 mM 50 ,60 -dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB),
indicating that a cobalamin is a preferred corrinoid cofactor of strains
BAV1, GT and FL2 when grown with chlorinated ethenes as electron acceptors. Even though the methanogen and acetogen populations tested did not
produce cobalamin, the addition of DMB enabled guided biosynthesis and
generated a cobalamin that supported Dehalococcoides’ activity and growth.
Guided cobalamin biosynthesis may offer opportunities to sustain and
enhance Dehalococcoides activity in contaminated subsurface environments.

1. Introduction
Chlorinated compounds, including tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene
(TCE), are widespread and toxic environmental pollutants [1,2]. Strains of the
organohalide-respiring species Dehalococcoides mccartyi couple growth to the
reductive dechlorination of a variety of chlorinated priority pollutants including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorobenzenes and chlorinated
solvents. Some D. mccartyi strains dechlorinate PCE, TCE, dichloroethenes
(DCEs) and vinyl chloride (VC) to non-toxic ethene, and thus are of great
interest to restore aquifers contaminated with chlorinated ethenes [2–4].
Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains grow in completely synthetic, defined
media, but cannot de novo synthesize the corrin ring and require exogenous
vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin, CN-Cbl) [2]. Corrinoids, such as CN-Cbl, contain
a heterocyclic tetrapyrrole ring with a central cobalt atom [5]. Some Archaea
and Bacteria synthesize corrinoids with an upper b-ligand moiety and a
lower a-ligand moiety, so-called cobamides, which participate in important
biological processes such as methanogenesis, acetogenesis and organohalide

Figure 1. Structures of cobalamin and the lower a-ligands of several characterized cobamides. In vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin, CN-Cbl), a cyano group is the upper
b-ligand and DMB is the lower a-ligand (circled). The structures were redrawn from [16,17]. DMB, 50 ,60 -dimethylbenzimidazole; 50 -OH-BEN, 50 -hydroxybenzimidazole.

respiration [5–7]. Cobamides with 50 ,60 -dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) as the lower a-ligand are cobalamins such as
adenosylcobalamin, hydroxocobalamin and cyanocobalamin
(CN-Cbl). A cobalamin or a cobamide serve as cofactors for
the PCE and TCE reductive dehalogenases (RDases) of several organohalide-respiring genera such as Dehalobacter,
Desulfitobacterium and Sulfurospirillum, and exemplify the
crucial roles these corrinoids play in the energy metabolism
of organohalide-respiring Bacteria [7–10].
Genome sequence analysis demonstrated that D. mccartyi
strains are corrinoid auxotrophs and lack the ability for de
novo corrinoid biosynthesis [11,12]. A previous survey demonstrated that only about half (209 out of 410) CN-Cbl-requiring
Bacteria possessed genes encoding corrinoid biosynthesis
pathways [11]. Genes encoding the BtuBFCD type CN-Cbl/
cobamide transport system were found in most (more than
90%) of the corrinoid-auxotrophic Bacteria [11], indicating
external CN-Cbl/cobamide uptake rather than de novo biosynthesis is a common strategy of microorganisms to acquire this
essential cofactor. Thus, it is not surprising that Dehalococcoides
also possess BtuBFCD gene homologues as well as cobinamide
(i.e. a cobamide lacking the lower a-ligand) salvage genes
(cobU and cbiZ) to save the energy cost associated with
adenosylcobalamin (Ado-Cbl) de novo biosynthesis [11].
Enhanced Dehalococcoides growth and faster dechlorination rates were observed in co- or tri-cultures of D. mccartyi
strain 195 and corrinoid-producers such as Acetobacterium
woodii, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans and Desulfovibrio vulgaris
Hildenborough, suggesting that strain 195 benefited from
the corrinoids produced in the co-cultures [13,14]. Recently,
interspecies cobalamin transfer from Geobacter lovleyi to
D. mccartyi strains BAV1 and FL2 was demonstrated in

CN-Cbl-free co-cultures [15]. Geobacter sulfurreducens did
not support Dehalococcoides activity unless DMB was supplied to the growth medium suggesting that only the
cobamides with specific types of lower ligands, such as
DMB, meet Dehalococcoides’ nutritional requirements.
In anoxic subsurface environments, Dehalococcoides are
members of diverse microbial communities, and some populations synthesize cobamides with different lower a-ligands
[16,17]. Cobalamin and the naturally occurring cobamides
tested in this study are shown in figure 1. For example,
50 -hydroxybenzimidazolyl-cobamide (factor III) or adenylcobamide ( pseudo vitamin B12) are typically produced by
methanogenic Archaea as the cofactors for methyltransferases
involved in methane formation [18]. Acetogenic Bacteria synthesize benzimidazolyl- or phenolyl-type cobamides required
for specific enzymes of the Wood– Ljungdahl pathway
[18]. Cobalamin (50 ,60 -dimethylbenzimidazolyl-cobamide)
was identified as the corrinoid produced by A. woodii,
phenolyl- and p-cresolyl-cobamide were purified from
S. ovata, and 50 -methylbenzimidazolyl-cobamide was isolated
from sulfate-reducers, such as Desulfobacterium autotrophicum
and Desulfobulbus propionicus [19,20].
In this study, we investigated Dehalococcoides reductive
dechlorination activity and growth during the co-cultivation
with corrinoid-producing methanogenic Archaea and acetogenic Bacteria. Co-cultures established in CN-Cbl-free
medium demonstrated interspecies cobamide transfer and
identified the specific type(s) of corrinoid that Dehalococcoides
can use. Knowledge of how Dehalococcoides’ nutritional
requirements are met in natural communities will reveal the
ecophysiology of strictly organohalide-respiring, corrinoidauxotrophic Chloroflexi. Understanding the bottlenecks (i.e.

2. Methods
(a) Pure cultures and growth conditions

(ii) Total cobamide extraction and purification
Total intracellular cobamides were extracted and purified using
an established protocol with the following modifications [25].
Sporomusa ovata or Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 cultures (1 litre
each) grown with H2/CO2 were centrifuged at 15 000g for
15 min at 48C. Following removal of the supernatants, each cell
pellet was suspended in 5 ml deionized water, the pH was
adjusted to 5 – 6 with 3 per cent (v/v) glacial acetic acid, and
KCN (100 mM stock solution) was added to reach a final concentration of 10 mM. The suspensions were vigorously shaken, each
transferred to sterile 50 ml plastic tubes and incubated for 20 min
in a boiling water bath. Following centrifugation at 15 000g for
15 min, the supernatants were collected and the pellets were
extracted a second time. The combined supernatants were
mixed with 0.01 volumes of a 3 per cent acetic acid solution
prior to loading onto a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters Corp, Milford, MA, USA), which had been equilibrated with 2 ml 100 per
cent methanol and 40 ml deionized water. Following sample
loading, the cartridge was washed with 10 ml deionized water
(20 interstitial volumes) and 7.5 ml 10 per cent methanol (15
interstitial volumes) prior to the final elution step with 10 ml
50 per cent methanol (20 interstitial volumes). The slightly
pink-coloured solution obtained from the final elution step was
vacuum dried and the residues were suspended in 0.5 ml sterile,
deionized water.

(b) Co-cultures
Triplicate co-cultures containing one of the three D. mccartyi strains
and either M. barkeri or one of the Sporomusa sp. were established in
160 ml vessels inside an anoxic chamber as described [15]. The
vessels were amended with 5 mM acetate and contained a H2 –
CO2 (80/20, v/v) headspace. To avoid CN-Cbl carry-over, cells
for inoculation were collected by centrifugation at 14 000g for
10 min at room temperature, and suspended in CN-Cbl-free
medium prior to inoculation. The positive control inocula were
prepared in the same way and inoculated into culture vessels
amended with 25 mg l21 CN-Cbl. Dehalococcoides mccartyi pure
cultures without CN-Cbl served as negative controls. Additional
co-culture replicates received 10 mM DMB (more than 99%
purity, Sigma-Aldrich-Fluka).

(c) DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene quantification
Cells from Dehalococcoides pure cultures and co-cultures were harvested from 1 ml culture suspension as described [15,24]. Briefly,
total genomic DNA was extracted using the MO BIO Soil DNA Isolation kit (MO BIO, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and a high efficiency bead
ruptor homogenizer (Omni International, Kennesaw, GA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Samples were processed with
the bead ruptor homogenizer at a speed 3.25 m s21 for 5 min. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to enumerate Dehalococcoides 16S
rRNA gene copies followed established protocols using primer set
Dhc1200F/Dhc1271R and probe FAM-BHQ1 Dhc1240 [24].

(d) Corrinoid measurements
(i) Microbiological B12 assay
Quantification of extracellular cobamides in pure and co-cultures
was performed using a microbiological assay with Lactobacillus
delbrueckii subsp. lactis (ATCC 7830) as the cobamide-auxotroph
test organism following described procedures [15]. To detect
intracellular cobamides, whole cells from 1.5 ml S. ovata or

(iii) HPLC analysis of cyanocobamides
Cyanocobamides were analysed using an Agilent 1200 series
HPLC system equipped with an Eclipse XDB-C18 column
(5 mm, 4.6  150 mm) and a diode array detector at a detection
wavelength of 361 nm. Samples (20 ml each) were injected and separated at 308C at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min21 using 0.1 per cent acetic
acid in water (eluent A) and 0.1 per cent acetic acid in methanol
(eluent B) as mobile phases. The initial ratio of 90 per cent A/10
per cent B was linearly decreased to 35 per cent A/65 per cent B
over a 12 min time window followed by a 4 min hold, before equilibration with 90 per cent A. CN-Cbl was identified by comparing
retention times and absorption spectra with authentic CN-Cbl
standards (more than 98% purity, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,
PA, USA) dissolved in deionized water.

(e) Other analytical methods
Methane, ethene and chlorinated ethenes were quantified using an
Agilent 7890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization
detector and a DB-624 capillary column (60 m  0.32 mm 
1.8 mm) as described [22]. Acetate was analysed using an Agilent
1200 series HPLC system equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H
column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Samples were acidified
with 1 M H2SO4 in a ratio of 19 : 1 (v/v) and separated with
4 mM aqueous H2SO4 as the mobile phase at a flow rate of
0.6 ml min21 and quantified using a UV detector set to 210 nm.

Dehalococcoides mccartyi strain BAV1 (ATCC BAA-2100), strain
GT (ATCC BAA-2099) and strain FL2 (ATCC BAA-2098) were
grown in 160 ml serum bottles containing 100 ml reduced, bicarbonate-buffered, defined mineral salts medium amended with
acetate (5 mM) and a N2 – CO2 (80/20, v/v) headspace [21 – 23].
Following autoclaving, the bottles were amended with 10 ml
hydrogen and 25 mg l21 CN-Cbl as described [15]. Neat TCE
(5 ml, 99%, Fisher, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and cis-DCE (5 ml,
99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich-Fluka, St Louis, MO, USA) were added
with a microlitre syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA). Following
equilibration, the bottles received 3 per cent (v/v) inocula from
dechlorinating cultures maintained under the same conditions. In
addition, culture bottles amended with 1 mg l21 CN-Cbl were
maintained to evaluate the effects of low CN-Cbl concentrations
on Dehalococcoides growth yields and dechlorination activities.
Pure cultures of M. barkeri strain Fusaro (DSM 804), S. ovata (DSM
2662) and Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 (16S rRNA gene GenBank
accession no. AY780559.1) were maintained in the same defined
mineral salts medium except that acetate, CN-Cbl and chlorinated
solvent additions were omitted. All culture vessels were incubated
stationary, with the stoppers down, at 308C in the dark.

Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 cultures were collected by centrifugation at 14 000 g for 2 min, suspended in sterile water, and
broken either by heating at 958C for 15 min or by sonicating
with a Branson 250 Sonifier Analog Cell Disruptor (Branson
Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT, USA) for 15 min at 50 per cent
duty cycle at an output of 60 W.

amounts of ethene from 50.3 + 0.4 mmoles of cis-DCE
(figure 2a) and 36.5 + 0.9 mmoles of TCE (figure 2c) provided as electron acceptor, respectively. Strain FL2 cultures
produced a mixture of VC and ethene (23.9 + 1.7 and
10.3 + 0.9 mmoles, respectively) during a 3-week incubation
period (figure 2e). Cultures that received 1 mg l21 CN-Cbl
exhibited lower dechlorination rates and incomplete dechlorination. Strain BAV1 cultures dechlorinated cis-DCE (50.3 +
0.4 mmoles) to VC (42.0 + 3.1 mmoles) and small amounts of
ethene (4.3 + 0.4 mmoles) by day 17. VC remained the major
dechlorination product (90.8 + 0.1%) after 27 days and
ethene accounted for 9.2 + 0.1% (figure 2b). In strain GT
cultures, more than one third of the initial TCE amount
(36.5 + 0.9 mmoles) remained after 27 days of incubation,
and cis-DCE (4.3 + 0.2 mmoles), VC (7.7 + 0.7 mmoles) and
ethene (4.7 + 1.1 mmoles) were detected (figure 2d). TCE
was dechlorinated at a rate of 9.0 + 1.1 mmoles l21 d21 or
about 2.2-fold slower compared with the TCE dechlorination
rates (19.6 + 0.2 mmoles l21 d21) observed in strain GT
cultures that received 25 mg l21 CN-Cbl (figures 2c,d). Similarly, strain FL2 cultures dechlorinated TCE at lower rates
(i.e. 9.8 + 2.3 versus 22.2 + 0.8 mmoles l21 d21 in medium
amended with 25 mg l21 CN-Cbl), and after a 4-week incubation period, 40.3 + 6.8% of the initial TCE was still
present with cis-DCE (7.9 + 0.4 mmoles) and VC (6.8 +
2.1 mmoles) as the dechlorination products but no ethene
was formed (figure 2f ).
CN-Cbl concentrations in the medium decreased concomitantly with reductive dechlorination and Dehalococcoides
growth, and the initial CN-Cbl concentration of 1 mg l21
declined to below 20 ng l21 during the 18-day incubation
period (figure 2b,d,f ). By day 27, reductive dechlorination
of the remaining chlorinated ethenes ceased, and the CNCbl concentrations in strain GT, strain FL2 and strain BAV1
cultures were 7.7 + 2.0 ng l21, below 5 ng l21 (i.e. below

the quantification limit of the microbiological B12 assay),
and below 2 ng l21 (i.e. below the detection limit), respectively. CN-Cbl was depleted at higher rates in the 25 mg l21
CN-Cbl-amended Dehalococcoides cultures. At day 17, when
BAV1 cultures had completely dechlorinated cis-DCE to
ethene, CN-Cbl concentrations dropped to 0.7 + 0.1 mg l21,
averaging an uptake rate of 1500 ng l21 d21 versus
63 ng l21 d21 in the BAV1 cultures amended with 1 mg l21
CN-Cbl (figure 2a,b). Strain GT and strain FL2 cultures
depleted CN-Cbl from an initial amount of 26.5 +
1.0 mg l21 to 0.03 + 0.03 and 1.0 + 0.7 mg l21, respectively,
at 25- and 24-fold higher rates compared with those rates
observed in the corresponding cultures amended with
1 mg l21 CN-Cbl (figure 2c–f ).
qPCR analysis demonstrated that limiting amounts of
1 mg l21 CN-Cbl affected Dehalococcoides growth yields,
which were calculated as described [22]. For example,
1.4 + 0.8  107 BAV1 cells per mmole of Cl2 released were
obtained in cultures amended with 1 mg l21 CN-Cbl, whereas
1.3 + 0.1  108 BAV1 cells per mmole of Cl2 released (a 9.1fold increase) were measured in cultures amended with
25 mg l21 CN-Cbl (table 1). Similar results were observed in
strain GT cultures with an average 2.8-fold higher growth
yield in medium amended with 25 mg l21 CN-Cbl (table 1).

(b) Cobamide production in methanogenic and
acetogenic cultures
During a 43-day incubation period, extracellular cobamide
concentrations gradually increased to 4.2 + 0.1 mg l21 in
M. barkeri strain Fusaro cultures concomitantly with methane
formation (figure 3a). No extracellular cobamides were
detected in the acetate-producing S. ovata (figure 3b) and
Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 cultures, which was unexpected
because Sporomusa spp. are known cobamide producers

when grown via H2/CO2 reductive acetogenesis. Cobamides
were also not detected in Sporomusa cell lysates suggesting
that Sporomusa produced cobamide(s), to which the indicator organism L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis did not respond (i.e.
the cobamide cannot be detected and quantified with the
microbiological B12 assay).

(c) Reductive dechlorination in co-cultures
In D. mccartyi strain BAV1 and M. barkeri strain Fusaro
co-cultures amended with 25 mg l21 CN-Cbl, reductive
dechlorination and methane formation occurred concomitantly. Strain BAV1 dechlorinated 53.1 + 0.6 mmoles of cisDCE to stoichiometric amounts of ethene with concomitant
methane formation (86.9 + 15.9 mmoles) by strain Fusaro
within 25 days (figure 4a). In BAV1/Fusaro co-cultures not
amended with CN-Cbl, methane was formed (225.2 +
26.2 mmoles per bottle) and maximum amounts of 3.7 +
0.2 mg l21 cobamide were measured as CN-Cbl equivalents
using the microbiological B12 assay in the culture suspensions
after 30 days (figure 4b). Only negligible reductive dechlorination activity occurred in these co-cultures, and less than
12 per cent of the initial amount of cis-DCE was dechlorinated to VC (6.1 + 0.1 mmoles). Negative controls (i.e.
strain BAV1 cultures without CN-Cbl) produced 9.8 +
0.9 mmoles of VC (figure 4c).
Dehalococcoides/S. ovata co-cultures amended with
25 mg l21 CN-Cbl exhibited acetate formation concomitantly
with complete reductive dechlorination of 65.9 + 1.7 mmoles
of cis-DCE to ethene (figure 4d), indicating growth of both
populations. Both S. ovata and Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 grew

in co-cultures lacking CN-Cbl but extracellular cobamides
were not detected using the microbiological B12 assay, and
only 10.6 + 3.6 and 10.4 + 0.5 mmoles of VC were produced
in BAV1/S. ovata and BAV1/Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 co-cultures, respectively (figure 4e,f). These findings demonstrate
that Sporomusa sp. were unable to support BAV1 reductive
dechlorination activity. Activities of D. mccartyi strains GT
and FL2 were also tested in the co-cultures with M. barkeri
strain Fusaro, S. ovata and Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1. Only
insignificant dechlorination of TCE to cis-DCE (less than 0.5%
of the initial amount of TCE) occurred in these co-cultures
(data not shown).

(d) Guided biosynthesis of cobalamin in Sporomusa
The CN-Cbl standard (5 mg l21) eluted at a retention time of
6.94 min (figure 5a). HPLC separation of cyanocobamides
extracted from Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 (figure 5b) and
S. ovata (data not shown) cells collected from cultures not
amended with DMB yielded two major peaks with retention
times of 9.80 and 11.25 min, matching previous reports that
two types of cobamides, phenolyl-cobamide and p-cresolylcobamide, were synthesized by S. ovata [26]. The addition
of 10 mM DMB to the culture medium did not affect
growth, and Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 cultures reached similar OD 600 nm values of 0.040– 0.041 (data not shown).
Distinct cyanocobamide patterns were observed in Sporomusa
sp. strain KB-1 cultures amended with DMB. The peak
areas corresponding to phenolyl-cobamide and p-cresolylcobamide both decreased by about 80 per cent, and a major
peak with a retention time of 6.94 min, identical to that of

provide evidence for guided biosynthesis [27], and cyanocobalamin was the major cobamide when 10 mM DMB was
added to the growth medium.

(e) Recovery of Dehalococcoides dechlorination activity
in DMB-amended co-cultures
The addition of 10 mM DMB to non-dechlorinating
Dehalococcoides/Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 co-cultures stimulated reductive dechlorination activity. DMB-amended
BAV1/KB-1 and GT/KB-1 co-cultures completely dechlorinated cis-DCE (52.1 + 0.5 mmoles) and TCE (34.4 +
0.7 mmoles) to ethene, respectively (figure 6a,b). FL2/
KB-1 co-cultures reduced the initial TCE amount to VC
(8.5 + 1.2 mmoles) and ethene (28.5 + 2.0 mmoles) (figure
6c). Concomitant with cis-DCE or TCE dechlorination, extracellular cobamides measured using the microbiological B12
assay after 17 days of incubation gradually increased from
below the detection limit (i.e. less than 2 ng l21) to 2.5 + 0.4,
0.9 + 0.4 and 1.0 + 0.3 mg l21 in strain BAV1/strain KB-1,
strain GT/strain KB-1 and strain FL2/strain KB-1 co-cultures,
respectively (figure 6a–c).
Guided cobalamin biosynthesis through lower ligand
exchange with DMB was also observed in Dehalococcoides/
M. barkeri strain Fusaro co-cultures (figure 6d–f ). Methane formation occurred and extracellular cobamide concentrations

4. Discussion
CN-Cbl is a required cofactor for the characterized
D. mccartyi strains grown in axenic culture [2]. The responses
of D. mccartyi strain 195 to different CN-Cbl concentrations in
the medium revealed that maximum TCE dechlorination
rates and growth yields required CN-Cbl of 25 mg l21 or
higher concentrations [13]. In cultures of D. mccartyi strains
BAV1, GT and FL2 amended with 1 mg l21 CN-Cbl, CN-Cbl
was quickly depleted to below 10 ng l21, and TCE and cisDCE dechlorination was incomplete. Ethene formation,
about 2-fold higher dechlorination rates, and 2.8 –9.1-fold
increases in Dehalococcoides growth yields were observed in
cultures that received 25 mg l21 CN-Cbl. These findings
demonstrate that Dehalococcoides’ requirement for this essential cofactor must be understood to achieve and sustain
desirable reductive dechlorination rates and endpoints at
sites impacted with chloroorganic contaminants. Reductive
dechlorination and growth of D. mccartyi strain BAV1 and
strain FL2 were sustained in co-cultures with the PCE-tocis-DCE dechlorinating species G. lovleyi strain SZ, which possesses the complete cobamide biosynthesis pathway [15]. The
cobamide concentrations in these dechlorinating cocultures ranged from 10 to 30 ng l21, suggesting that the
cobamide flux may be the relevant factor to sustain Dehalococcoides’ dechlorination activity in microbial communities.
Genes encoding the prokaryotic BtuBFCD corrinoid uptake
system, which belongs to the ABC-type (ATP-binding cassette) transporter family, were identified in all sequenced
Dehalococcoides genomes [11]. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the outer membrane corrinoid receptor BtuB
of Escherichia coli had a high affinity for CN-Cbl with a
half-saturation concentration of 0.5 nM (0.68 mg l21) [28].
Dehalococcoides reductive dechlorination activity was sustained in D. mccartyi/G. lovleyi co-cultures with cobamide
concentrations of 10 –30 ng l21, suggesting that D. mccartyi
strains also possess high affinity cobamide uptake systems.
A crucial question is the source of the corrinoid cofactor to
sustain Dehalococcoides reductive dechlorination activity in
the environment, particularly in chlorinated solvent-contaminated aquifers. The Dehalococcoides-containing consortium
KB-1 used for bioaugmentation contains methanogens and

increased to 1.4–1.9 mg l21. In addition, cis-DCE and TCE
were completely dechlorinated to ethene in the strain
BAV1 and strain GT co-cultures, respectively, and strain
FL2 co-cultures dechlorinated the initial TCE amount
(34.4 + 0.7 mmoles) of VC (16.0 + 4.1 mmoles) and ethene
(18.8 + 5.3 mmoles).
Negligible Dehalococcoides growth was observed in the
co-cultures without DMB. In contrast, Dehalococcoides cell densities increased 29.8- to 51.5-fold in the DMB-amended cocultures with Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1. Strain BAV1 cells
increased from 6.3 + 2.0  106 cells ml21 (cells introduced
with the inoculum) to 1.9 + 0.1  108 cells ml21, strain
GT cells increased from 4.0 + 0.5  106 to 2.1 + 0.3 
108 cells ml21, and strain FL2 cells increased from 2.4 +
0.3  106 to 9.5 + 1.6  107 cells ml21. In the DMB-amended
M. barkeri strain Fusaro co-cultures, D. mccartyi strain BAV1,
strain GT and strain FL2 cell densities increased 31-, 41and 37-fold to reach 2.0 + 0.1  108, 1.6 + 0.0  108 and
9.0 + 2.7  107 cells ml21, respectively (table 1).

CO2-reducing acetogens [29]. Both methanogenic Archaea
and acetogenic Bacteria are known to synthesize cobamides
with different lower ligands (figure 1). 50 -Hydroxybenzimidazolyl-cobamide (factor III) and adenyl-cobamide ( pseudo
vitamin B12) are the predominant cobamides isolated from
methanogenic Archaea [30], and factor III was identified in
M. barkeri cultures [31]. In Dehalococcoides co-cultures with
M. barkeri strain Fusaro, more than 4 mg l21 CN-Cbl equivalents, presumably factor III, were quantified in culture
suspensions; however, only negligible reductive dechlorination activity, similar to negative control cultures, was
observed, indicating that factor III cannot fulfil Dehalococcoides’ corrinoid requirement. These findings are supported
by a previous study that reported that D. mccartyi strain
195 reductive dechlorination activity was not enhanced in
co-cultures with Methanobacterium congolense [14]. Pure culture studies with D. mccartyi strain 195 corroborated that
purified factor III and phenolic cobamides did not support
reductive dechlorination, and growth only occurred when
cobamides containing benzimidazolyl types of lower ligands
were available [32]. Although the specific cobamides produced by Methanobacterium congolense and many other
methanogens have not been thoroughly explored, the data
reported here confirm that at least the 50 -hydroxybenzimidazolyl-cobamide produced by some methanogens cannot fulfil
the D. mccartyi corrinoid cofactor requirement.
Cobamides containing a phenolic-type lower ligand, i.e.
phenolyl- and p-cresolyl-cobamide, were first purified from
S. ovata, and were found in other Bacteria capable of H2/CO2
reductive acetogenesis [26]. Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 was isolated from the dechlorinating KB-1 consortium and shares 98.5
per cent sequence identity with the 16S rRNA gene of S. ovata

(AJ279800.1). Both Sporomusa isolates produced phenolyland p-cresolyl-cobamide, suggesting that they represent the
characteristic cobamides of the genus Sporomusa.
The test organism for the microbiological B12 assay,
L. delbrueckii, did not respond to S. ovata or Sporomusa sp.
strain KB-1 culture suspensions or cell lysates, indicating
that the cobamides with phenolic lower ligands cannot
fulfil the corrinoid cofactor requirement of L. delbrueckii.
Many prokaryotes, including D. mccartyi strains and
L. delbrueckii, use adenosyl-cobalamin-dependent class II
ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs), which catalyse the conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides [11]. Since D.
mccartyi genomes harbour multiple copies of class II RNR
genes, it is possible that the lack of dechlorination activity
and Dehalococcoides growth in the Sporomusa co-cultures was
not only caused by non-functional RDases but also because
of non-functional RNRs.
Interestingly, Dehalococcoides dechlorination activity and
growth occurred in the DMB-amended co-cultures. In the
presence of 10 mM DMB, CN-Cbl was the predominant corrinoid extracted from Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 cultures,
indicating that guided biosynthesis allows Sporomusa sp.
to generate a corrinoid cofactor that fulfils Dehalococcoides’
nutritional requirements. Similar observations were made in
D. mccartyi/G. sulfurreducens co-cultures that were amended
with DMB [15], suggesting that guided biosynthesis may be
a relevant process for supplying D. mccartyi strains with the
required cobalamin cofactor.
In DMB-amended Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 co-cultures
with each of the D. mccartyi strains BAV1, GT and FL2, the
dechlorinators attained population sizes of 2.1 + 0.2  108,
2.1 + 0.3  108 and 9.0 + 1.4  107 cells per mmole of chloride released, respectively. These cell numbers were 1.7-,
1.4- and 2.2-fold higher compared with axenic cultures that
received 25 mg l21 CN-Cbl. Dehalococcoides mccartyi strains

are known to grow better in mixed cultures, presumably
because community members supply Dehalococcoides
with unknown growth factors. Hence, it is possible that
M. barkeri strain Fusaro and the Sporomusa isolates provided
the D. mccartyi strains with not yet identified compounds
that enhance growth yields. Another possible explanation
for the lower growth yields observed with CN-Cbl is the
cell’s energetic burden associated with the replacement of
the upper cyanide ligand [33].
The microbial synthesis of non-native cobamides in the
presence of excess non-native lower ligand is known as
guided biosynthesis [17,27,34]. Guided biosynthesis has
been demonstrated with model organisms such as Propionibacterium shermanii, E. coli and Streptomyces griseus to obtain
desired cobamides [17]. Factor III synthesized by Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum was replaced by a cobalamin in
medium amended with DMB without affecting methane formation and growth [35]. Synthesis of a cobalamin in the
presence of DMB has also been demonstrated in M. barkeri
cultures [36]. The co-culture experiments with D. mccartyi
strains demonstrated that the addition of DMB to the medium
enabled guided biosynthesis and the formation of a cobalamin
by M. barkeri strain Fusaro and Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1.
Sporomusa sp. strain KB-1 replaced the phenolic cobamides
with a cobalamin without apparent effects on its own growth
suggesting that cobalamin can replace the phenolyl- and
p-cresolyl-cobamides during growth with H2/CO2.
Survival of corrinoid auxotrophs such as Dehalococcoides
relies on cobamides and corrinoid precursors (e.g. cobinamides) produced and released by corrinoid-synthesizing
Archaea and Bacteria. It is currently unclear to what extent
and under what conditions microorganisms capable of de
novo corrinoid synthesis produce and release cobamides
and/or corrin ring precursors to the surrounding medium.
While methanogens and acetogens readily release cobamides

identify Dehalococcoides’ nutritional limitations and potentially predict and manipulate reductive dechlorination
activity. Limited dechlorination activity of Dehalococcoides
and related corrinoid-auxotroph, organohalide-respiring
Chloroflexi (e.g. Dehalogenimonas [38,39], ‘Dehalobium’ [40])
is regarded as a major constraint to achieve detoxification at
sites contaminated with chlorinated contaminants. Hence,
elucidating the nutritional requirements and ecophysiologies
of organohalide-respiring Chloroflexi in natural and contaminated environments will help develop predictive
understanding and new strategies for stimulating in situ
reductive dechlorination activity.

into the medium, at least under laboratory cultivation
conditions, the formation of cobalamin requires DMB. Key
questions are the origin of DMB in anoxic environments
(i.e. who is synthesizing DMB?), and whether the availability
of DMB limits cobalamin biosynthesis and Dehalococcoides
activity. The biosynthesis pathway(s) of DMB under anoxic
conditions has remained elusive, and the flux of DMB in subsurface environments has not been evaluated. While our
experiments have demonstrated cobalamin production
through guided biosynthesis, the relevance of this process
in natural microbial communities has yet to be demonstrated. All D. mccartyi strains harbour cobT, cobC and cobS
genes implicated in the cobalamin assembly from DMB and
cobinamide [37], suggesting Dehalococcoides has the ability
to assemble cobalamin if the precursors are available. Independently of whether Dehalococcoides or other microbes
perform the final cobalamin assembly, the sources and
fluxes of its precursors, in particular DMB, need to be understood in natural and disturbed microbial communities to

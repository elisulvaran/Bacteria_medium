Abstract
In this study, we report on phylogenetic and physiological characterization of an anaerobic culture capable of
reductive dehalogenation of tetrachloroethene (PCE) obtained from a PCE-contaminated site. The culture was enriched
using different combinations of electron donors (hydrogen and acetate) and electron acceptors (PCE, cis-1,2dichloroethene (cDCE) and controls without chlorinated ethenes). The resulting subcultures were analyzed using three
different approaches: chemical analysis to document conversion of chlorinated ethenes; polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) of 16S rRNA gene fragments and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to compare community
compositions; ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to quantify speciﬁc groups of microorganisms using
oligonucleotide probes previously designed or newly designed based on the sequences retrieved from sequence analysis
of speciﬁc DGGE bands. Members of two genera which contain bacteria capable of reductive dehalogenation were
detected in the culture: Dehalococcoides and Desulfitobacterium. The combined analyses suggested that Dehalococcoides-like bacteria are associated with complete dehalogenation of chlorinated ethenes to ethene with hydrogen as
electron donor; and Desulfitobacterium-like bacteria, in contrast, are associated with incomplete PCE dehalogenation to
cDCE and appear to be able to use acetate as electron donor. In addition, Sporomusa-like bacteria were identiﬁed,
which most likely act as homoacetogens. The results demonstrated that combination of culture enrichment with
different substrates, DGGE, and FISH allowed a detailed qualitative and quantitative characterization of the dominant
microorganisms associated with reductive dehalogenation.

Anthropogenic chlorinated organic compounds, such
as tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE),
are common groundwater contaminants due to their
widespread use as solvents. Under anaerobic conditions,
these compounds can be reductively dehalogenated to
less chlorinated ethenes or innocuous ethene by microorganisms through dehalorespiration (McCarty, 1997).

Because this process has the potential of completely
detoxifying chlorinated ethenes, it is recognized as a
promising approach for the cleanup of contaminated
sites and has been extensively studied for in situ
bioremediation. For the purpose of achieving effective
PCE/TCE bioremediation, it is important to understand
the factors controlling the rate and extent of reductive
dehalogenation.
Among the factors affecting reductive dehalogenation
are the metabolic capabilities of and interactions among
the microorganisms involved. To date a number of
bacteria have been cultivated that are capable of
reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated ethenes (Gerritse et al., 1996; Krumholz, 1997; Maymo-Gatell et al.,
1997; Miller et al., 1997; Holliger et al., 1999; He et al.,
2003; Sung et al., 2003). Of these, most can only
dehalogenate PCE to cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE),
such as Dehalobacter restrictus, Sulfurospirillum multivorans (previously Dehalospirillum multivorans (Luijten
et al., 2003)), Desulfuromonas chloroethenica, Desulfuromonas michiganensis, and some Desulfitobacterium
species; only Dehalococcoides species were identiﬁed as
organisms capable of complete dehalogenation of PCE
(Dehalococcoides ethenogenes) or cDCE/vinyl chloride
(VC) (Dehalococcoides sp. Strain BAV1) to ethene. Most
of these organisms can use hydrogen but not acetate as
the direct electron donor (hydrogenotrophic dehalogenators), such as Dehalobacter restrictus, S. multivorans, D. ethenogenes, and some Desulfitobacterium
species. In contrast, only a few can use acetate as
electron donor (acetotrophic dehalogenators), including
D. chloroethenica (Krumholz et al., 1996; Krumholz,
1997) and D. michiganensis (Loefﬂer et al., 1998; Sung et
al., 2003). No acetotrophic dehalogenators cultivated so
far are capable of complete dehalogenation of PCE to
ethene, and hydrogen is generally assumed to be the
major electron donor to sustain complete dehalogenation (Distefano et al., 1992; Smatlak et al., 1996;
Ballapragada et al., 1997; Fennell et al., 1997; Yang
and McCarty, 1998). Given the signiﬁcant difference of
these organisms in their capabilities to reduce chlorinated ethenes, it is necessary to identify those involved
in reductive dehalogenation occurring at contaminated
sites and to understand how they interact with each
other and with other organisms (because almost always
complex microbial communities are expected under ﬁeld
conditions) so as to optimize in situ reductive dehalogenation.
Culture-independent nucleic acid-based techniques
have been providing interesting insights into the microorganisms in complex microbial communities in recent
years (Muyzer, 1999; Amann and Ludwig, 2000;
Dahllof, 2002). Nevertheless, there have been only few
studies attempting to identify the organisms in complex
microbial communities associated with reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated ethenes using these methods

3955

(Flynn et al., 2000; Loefﬂer et al., 2000; Fennell et al.,
2001; Duhamel et al., 2002; Hendrickson et al., 2002;
Lowe et al., 2002; Richardson et al., 2002; Aulenta et al.,
2004). In these studies, either the organisms of interest,
in most cases Dehalococcoides species, were detected in
microcosms or ﬁeld samples by amplifying speciﬁc 16S
rRNA genes (rDNAs) with polymerase chain reaction
(PCR); or universal primers were used to amplify all
bacterial 16S rDNA sequences present, followed by
cloning, sequencing or ﬁngerprinting. The ﬁrst approach
only allows for speciﬁc detection of microorganisms
with known sequence information. In contrast, the
second approach may provide a more comprehensive
understanding of the microbial community structure
including identiﬁcation of unknown organisms from
environmental samples. However, due to the technical
limitation of these qualitative PCR-based methods
(Chandler et al., 1997; von Wintzingerode et al., 1997;
Qiu et al., 2001), it is difﬁcult to obtain quantitative
information of the microorganisms in the samples, and
usually only the dominant organisms in the community
were retrieved, which were not necessarily the organisms
actively involved in reductive dehalogenation. In addition, most of the previous studies did not provide direct
correlations between identity and metabolic function of
the organisms detected. Their physiological traits were
usually inferred from sequence similarity to known
organisms in public databases.
In this study, we report on phylogenetic and
physiological identiﬁcation of dehalogenating organisms
in a microbial community by combining culture enrichment procedures and molecular analysis techniques. The
enrichment procedure was designed according to
assumed metabolic requirements of dehalogenators
using different combinations of electron donors (including hydrogen and acetate) and electron acceptors
(including PCE, cDCE, and controls without chlorinated ethenes). Hydrogen and acetate were selected as
electron donors because they were major products from
anaerobic degradation of benzoate, which was the
substrate used to maintain the studied culture. This
selection is of universal signiﬁcance as hydrogen and
acetate are major intermediates in anaerobic decomposition of organic matter (Schink, 1997). The purpose
of this step was to enrich the organisms possessing
speciﬁc physiological traits. Subsequently, a biphasic full
cycle rRNA analysis (Amann et al., 1995) was
performed to identify and quantify the microorganisms
involved in reductive dehalogenation by combining 16S
rDNA-based PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH). DGGE analysis followed by sequencing of
speciﬁc gene fragments was applied to obtain information on the community composition under different
culturing conditions and to identify enriched organisms.
FISH was used for in situ quantiﬁcation of selected

organisms with speciﬁc oligonucleotide probes previously or newly designed based on the sequences
retrieved from sequencing analysis.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
Liquid PCE (499.5%, GC grade, Fluka, Buchs,
Switzerland), TCE (499.5%, GC grade, Fluka), and
cDCE (97%, GC grade, Fluka) were used for preparing
stock feed solutions and analytical standards. VC
(499%, Scott Specialty Gases, Alltech Associates,
Deerﬁeld, IL), ethene (499%, PanGas, Dagmersellen,
Switzerland), and methane (499%, PanGas) were used
as analytical standards. Hydrogen (10% in nitrogen,
PanGas), acetate (sodium salt, 99%, Fluka), and
benzoate (sodium salt, 99%, Fluka) were used as
electron donors and to develop analytical standards.
2.2. Culture and growth medium
The dehalogenating culture used in the study was
maintained in an anaerobic chemostat (total volume
2.3 L, liquid volume 1.9 L, continuously stirred) inoculated with a culture from a chemostat described
previously (Yang and McCarty, 1998) which was
initially inoculated with aquifer material from a PCEcontaminated groundwater site in Victoria, TX. The
culture in the daughter chemostat behaved similarly in
physiology to the previous reactor following ﬁve months
of incubation. It was maintained at 28 (72) 1C. A basal
medium (Yang and McCarty, 1998) supplemented with
1.7 mM sodium benzoate, 20 mg/L yeast extract, and
0.98 mM PCE was added to the chemostat using a
syringe pump at a rate of 50 mL/day, resulting in a 38day retention time. Every day 50 mL of liquid was
removed to bring the liquid volume back to 1.9 L. Under
the described conditions, complete conversion of PCE to
ethene was observed. Due to the presence of active
methane-producing microorganisms, which can use
hydrogen and acetate as electron donors, no accumulation of these intermediates of benzoate degradation was
observed in the chemostat.
A pure culture of D. ethenogenes strain 195 was used
as a control in PCR-DGGE analysis. The culture was
grown on hydrogen and PCE as previously described
(Maymo-Gatell et al., 1997).
2.3. Culture enrichment scheme
For culture enrichment, hydrogen and acetate were
used as electron donors, PCE and cDCE as electron
acceptors. With different combinations of electron
donors and electron acceptors, six different types of

subcultures were established including two controls with
electron donors, but without chlorinated ethenes. Each
combination was prepared in duplicates. All enrichment
experiments were conducted at room temperature
(22 1C) in 117-mL serum bottles. At the start of the
experiment, 60 mL of the chemostat culture was added
to each bottle anaerobically by gas purging with an 80%
N2/20% CO2 mixture during the transfer. PCE, cDCE,
hydrogen, and acetate were then added in amounts of
45, 15, 270, and 270 mmol, respectively, if required.
Hydrogen and acetate were added in excess to ensure the
completeness of dehalogenating reactions. The reason
that different amounts of PCE and cDCE were used was
because approximately the same amount of time was
required to completely dehalogenate the PCE and cDCE
added according to our previous experience. After about
four weeks of incubation when 80% of the chlorinated
ethenes was degraded (in terms of total chlorine
removal) in the subcultures, these cultures were transferred (50% v/v) into the fresh basal medium. In total,
six sequential transfers were made in a similar manner
for each subculture. Chlorinated ethenes, ethene,
methane, and acetate were measured every 5–7 days to
monitor the physiological changes of the cultures.
Samples were taken at the end of the 2nd, 4th, and 6th
transfer for DGGE analysis and ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization.
Bottles were sealed with butyl rubber stoppers (Bellco
Glass, Vineland, NJ) and aluminum crimp caps to
maintain anaerobic conditions. Sorption of chlorinated
compounds by the rubber stoppers was less than 5%
after the ﬁrst few days so that good mass balances could
be maintained throughout the studies. All bottles were
continuously mixed at 140 rpm on a shaker table (Adolf
Kuhner, Basel, Switzerland).
2.4. Analytical methods
PCE, TCE, cDCE, VC, ethene, and methane were
quantiﬁed by a Fisons HRGC Mega 2 Series gas
chromatography (GC) (Fisons, Milan, Italy), using
250 mL headspace samples. The GC was equipped with
a ﬂame ionization detector and a GS-Q fused-silica
capillary column (length, 30 m; inside diameter,
0.53 mm; Agilent Technologies, Basel, Switzerland).
Analyses were performed by using a temperature
program (40–180 1C, 20 1C/min). Compounds were
identiﬁed by comparison of their retention times with
that of external standards. Total amount of gaseous
compounds in liquid were calculated by using published
Henry’s law constants (Gossett, 1987). Organic acid
concentrations were determined with a DX-320 ion
chromatography (IC) system, using 100 mL liquid
samples. The IC was equipped with an electrical
conductivity detector and an EG40 eluent gradient
generator (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). The following

ARTICLE IN PRESS

KOH eluent gradient was used: 0–7 min, 1 mM KOH;
7–25 min, 1–25 mM KOH; 25–28 min, 25–60 mM KOH;
28–28.1 min, 60–1 mM KOH; and 28.1–32 min, 1 mM
KOH. Identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation were made by
comparison with external standards.
2.5. DNA extraction
From each subculture 10 mL of sample was transferred with sterile syringe into 15 mL polypropylene
tubes and immediately centrifuged at 4500g for 10 min.
After discarding the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL DNA extraction buffer (50 mM
NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, 5% sodium dodecyl
sulfate; pH 8) and DNA was extracted and puriﬁed
according to the method of Sigler and Zeyer (Sigler and
Zeyer, 2002). DNA samples were stored at 20 1C until
further analysis.
2.6. 16S rDNA amplification and DGGE analysis
For Bacteria-speciﬁc PCR of 16S rDNA fragments,
the primers BAC 341f-GC (50 -GC-clamp-CCT ACG
GGA GGC AGC AG-30 ) and BAC 534r (50 -ATT ACC
GCG GCT GCT GG-30 ) (Muyzer et al., 1993) were
used. The PCR cocktail contained 0.2 mM of each
primer, 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleotide (Invitrogen,
Basel, Switzerland), 2 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mg mL1 bovine
serum albumin (Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland), 1 U of Taq
polymerase (Invitrogen), 1 mL of DNA extract, and
1  PCR reaction buffer in a ﬁnal volume of 50 mL. PCR
ampliﬁcation was carried out with a PTC-200 Peltier
Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). After
initial denaturation at 95 1C for 5 min, 35 cycles of
denaturation at 94 1C for 30 s, primer annealing at 55 1C
for 45 s and extension at 72 1C for 45 s was performed
followed by a ﬁnal extension step at 72 1C for 5 min.
DGGE analysis of 16S rDNA fragments was performed using DCodeTM universal mutation detection
system (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Gels
(16 cm  16 cm) consisted of 10% bis-: acrylamide
(37.5:1) and a denaturant gradient of 40–60%. Electrophoresis was performed in 1  TAE buffer (0.04 M Tris
base, 0.02 M sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA; pH 7.4)
at 60 1C and 75 V for 15 h. Gels were stained for 30 min
with a 1:10,000 dilution of GelStars nucleic acid stain
(Bio Whittaker, Denmark) and analyzed using the Gel
Doc 2000 system (BioRad) and QuantityOne software
(BioRad).
2.7. Cloning and sequence analysis
Portions of selected bands were excised from DGGE
gels for sequence determination by coring the band of
interest with a sterile pipette tip. Bands derived from
different subcultures that appeared to share the same

3957

migration position were all excised in order to account
for possible differences in the phylotypes that might
have occurred during enrichment. Gel pieces were
placed in 0.2 mL reaction tubes containing 100 mL of
sterile water. After incubation for 3 h at 421C, 2 mL of
the solution containing the eluted DNA was used for
PCR and DGGE analysis described above. This
procedure was repeated until signals of the desired
bands were obtained without other co-migrating bands.
Migration positions of plasmid inserts were checked and
were in agreement with the excised bands in the
community DGGE ﬁngerprints. The ‘‘pure’’ DNA
fragments were then excised and re-ampliﬁed using the
primers described above, but without the GC-clamp.
PCR products were cloned as described previously
(Pesaro et al., 2003). Inserts of retrieved plasmids were
ampliﬁed with BAC 341f-GC/BAC 534r primers and
migration positions on DGGE gels were reconﬁrmed by
directly comparing with the positions of the originally
excised bands. Sequences of inserts were commercially
determined on one strand (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). A comparison of sequences obtained in this
study with those of previous studies was performed
through a BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) search of the
GenBank database.

2.8. Oligonucleotide probes and probe design for
Desulfitobacterium species
A previously-described FISH probe, Dhe1259t was
used here for in situ quantiﬁcation of Dehalococcoides
species (Yang and Zeyer, 2003). Probe Dsf440 and its
helper probe Dsf475 (1:1, mol/mol) used for in situ
quantiﬁcation of Desulfitobacterium species were designed using the PROBE-DESIGN program of ARB
software (Amann and Ludwig, 2000) based on ﬁve
sequences retrieved from DGGE and sequence analysis.
Their speciﬁcities were then checked with the PROBEMATCH program of the Ribosomal Database Project
(Maidak et al., 1997). The optimal hybridization
stringency of Dsf440 and Dsf475 was determined with
the acetate/PCE subculture by increasing the formamide
concentration in the hybridization buffer in increments
of 5% at a constant hybridization temperature of 42 1C.
Probe-conferred signal intensity remained at the same
level following the addition of formamide up to 5%
and then decreased rapidly. Therefore, 5% formamide
was used for all subsequent hybridization experiments
with these probes. Samples were also analyzed with
probe Non338 (Amann et al., 1995) to estimate the
number of autoﬂuorescent cells. Sequences and target
sites of the probes used in this study are given in
Table 1. Oligonucleotides synthesized with 50 -Cy3
labels were purchased from MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg,
Germany).

Approximately 10 mL of each subculture sample was
immediately ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphatebuffered saline (PBS; 0.13 M NaCl, 7 mM Na2HPO4,
and 3 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.2) at 0 1C for 12 h, washed
twice in PBS and subsequently stored in 50% ethanol in
PBS at 20 1C until further analysis (Zarda et al., 1998).
Whole-cell hybridization was performed based on the
protocol of Zarda et al. (Zarda et al., 1998). Fixed
samples were applied to eight-well, teﬂon-coated slides
(Erie Scientiﬁc Co., Portsmouth, NH), air-dried, and
dehydrated in an ethanol series (50%, 80% and 96%)
for 3 min each. A mixture of 1 mL probe (25–30 ng/mL),
9 mL hybridization buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 20 mM TrisHCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.01% SDS (pH 7.2)), and a speciﬁc
amount of formamide depending on the probe used
(Table 1) was applied to each well, followed by
incubation for 2 h in a humid chamber at 42 1C. The
slides were washed in pre-warmed washing buffer for
15 min at 48 1C, then rinsed with deionized water, and
air-dried. The washing buffer contained 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.2), 10 mM EDTA, 0.01% SDS, and 636 or
112 mM NaCl (when 5% or 30% formamide was used
during hybridization, respectively). When probing for
Desulfitobacterium species, which belong to the grampositive bacteria, a pretreatment procedure with lysozyme (400 units/mL for 5 min at 0 1C) was included
before hybridization to increase the permeability of
these cells (Meier et al., 1999).
After hybridization, 20 mL of DNA intercalating
ﬂuorescent dye 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI,
Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) (1 ng/mL) was added to
each well. After incubation for 3 min at room temperature in the dark, the slides were rinsed with deionized
water and air-dried. DAPI staining was always included to detect total microorganisms present in the
preparation. Microscopy was performed as described
previously (Zarda et al., 1998). Bacteria were counted at
1000  magniﬁcation. Forty ﬁelds selected at random
covering an area of 0.01 mm2 each were examined from
a sample distributed over eight circular areas of 53 mm2
each. Counting results were corrected by subtracting the
numbers of autoﬂuorescent cells. Complemented with
cell concentration by centrifugation, reliable FISH
detection of 104 cells per mL could be obtained in this
study.

3. Results
3.1. Reductive dehalogenation with different electron
acceptors and electron donors
PCE or cDCE was dehalogenated in similar fashion
from one transfer to the other for each subculture

ARTICLE IN PRESS

throughout the duration of the experiment. Depicted in
Fig. 1 are time course plots of the total mass of
chlorinated ethenes and ethene during the sixth transfer
in different subcultures. Hydrogen was found to support
complete dehalogenation of both PCE (Fig. 1a) and
cDCE (Fig. 1b) to ethene. With acetate as electron
donor, reductive dehalogenation occurred only when
PCE was used as electron acceptor. cDCE was found to
be the major degradation product of PCE dehalogenation (Fig. 1c). In acetate/cDCE subcultures, trace
amounts of VC were detected (Fig. 1d), but this activity
could not be sustained even after longer periods of
incubation (data not shown). These results suggested
that acetate was unable to support cDCE dehalogenation, which is consistent with previous observations with
a culture from the same source (Yang and McCarty,
1998, 1999).
Rapid methane production was sustained during all
transfers in all controls, but in the subcultures amended
with either PCE or cDCE methane was only produced
during the ﬁrst two transfers and became undetectable
thereafter (data not shown).
3.2. DGGE and sequence analysis
Samples from each subculture were subject to DGGE
analysis to assess changes in the bacterial community
throughout the experiment. Because the main purpose
of this study was to identify the dominant microorgan-

isms involved in reductive dehalogenation but not to
perform full community analysis, only the DNA
fragments which manifested considerable changes (especially enriched) after incubation were sequenced for
further analysis. DGGE analyses of subculture samples
after all transfers revealed similar banding patterns, but
the most marked changes were observed after the last
transfer.
With hydrogen as electron donor (Fig. 2a), DGGE
ﬁngerprints of the subcultures receiving PCE or cDCE
clearly differed from the original chemostat culture
and controls without chlorinated ethenes (bands 1–3;
Fig. 2a). In comparison with the original chemostat
culture, band 1, which was very faint in the controls,
was enriched in H2/PCE and H2/cDCE subcultures.
DNA from band 1 was found to share 100% sequence
similarity to the 16S rDNA of uncultured Dehalococcoides species (Table 2), slightly different (1 bp difference in 170 bp) from that of D. ethenogenes strain 195.
Band 2 did not appear to be present in the original chemostat culture proﬁle, but was enriched to
different extents in all hydrogen-receiving subcultures.
The sequence of band 2 was most similar to the 16S
rDNA of Sporomusa sphaeroides (99% sequence similarity). In DGGE ﬁngerprints of H2/PCE subcultures, a
unique band, band 3, though fainter, was consistently
detected. Although this band appeared to have the same
migration position as the one derived from D. ethenogenes strain 195, sequence analysis of its DNA revealed

share the same migration position with D. ethenogenes

of acetate/PCE subcultures. Band 7 showed 100%

revealed 99% match to the sequence of D. hafniense.

Band 5, 7, and 8, differred by 1–2 bases in their
sequences, all had high similarity to known Desulfitobacterium species. It is hard to judge at this point
whether these different sequences represented different
species or only different copies of the rRNA operon of
the same species. Band 6 was observed in DGGE
patterns derived from acetate/cDCE subcultures and
was attributed to D. hafniense with 96% sequence
similarity.

were detected as Dehalococcoides-like bacteria in the
original chemostat culture (Fig. 4). In comparison, clear
changes occurred during enrichment. In two substrate
controls without chlorinated ethenes, the number of
Dehalococcoides-like bacteria decreased to undetectable

Dehalococcoides

Because the identiﬁcation of Dehalococcoides- and
Desulfitobacterium-like bacteria by DGGE analysis was
based on the sequences of DNA fragments of less than
200 base pairs in length, FISH was used as a
complement for veriﬁcation and, in addition, for
quantiﬁcation of the numbers of metabolically active
cells of these organisms in the subcultures and the
original chemostat culture. One of the two probes
designed previously for Dehalococcoides species,
Dhe1259t (Yang and Zeyer, 2003), was used in the
current study. As shown in Fig. 3a, these bacteria were
found mostly as small coccoids, consistent with the
morphology description for D. ethenogenes (MaymoGatell et al., 1997). Only 4% of DAPI-stained bacteria

level (not shown). However, in the presence of PCE
or cDCE, when hydrogen was used as electron donor,
a signiﬁcant increase in Dehalococcoides-like bacteria
was observed, which reached 52% and 76% of the
total bacteria in H2/cDCE and H2/PCE subcultures, respectively, at the end of the sixth transfer. In
contrast, Dehalococcoides-like bacteria dropped to
undetectable level when acetate was used as electron
donor.
Probe Dsf440 was designed according to ﬁve Desulfitobacterium-like sequences retrieved from sequence
analysis of excised bands. Due to the weak signal
obtained with this probe, a helper probe Dsf475 was
designed to improve the in situ accessibility of probe
Dsf440 and thus enhance ﬂuorescence (Fuchs et al.,
2000). The new probe was found to be fully complementary to four of the ﬁve sequences obtained from this
study with the exception of one band (band 8), which
exhibits one mismatch with the probe. In addition, it is
also fully complementary to or exhibits only one
mismatch to the 16S rDNA sequences of several
Desulfitobacterium species (Table 3). All other 16S
rDNA sequences in public databases have at least three
mismatches with the probe.
Desulfitobacterium-like bacteria appeared mostly rodshaped (Fig. 3b). These bacteria were not detected in the
original chemostat culture, but were greatly enriched in
all cultures receiving PCE as electron acceptor, reaching
53 and 17% of total bacteria counts with acetate and
hydrogen as electron donor, respectively (Fig. 4). In all
the other subcultures, in contrast, Desulfitobacteriumlike bacteria remained undetected.

4. Discussion
With a combination of culture enrichment, DGGE
ﬁngerprinting, and FISH analysis, Dehalococcoides- and
Desulfitobacterium-like bacteria were found to be
involved in reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated
ethenes in a complex microbial community. Several
lines of evidence provided in the study suggested that the
Dehalococcoides-like bacteria detected in this culture are
capable of complete dehalogenation of chlorinated
ethenes to ethene using hydrogen as electron donor.
Based on physiological characterization, only the subcultures enriched with PCE or cDCE as electron
acceptor, and hydrogen as electron donor maintained
the original chemostat culture’s capability of complete
PCE or cDCE dehalogenation, indicating the existence
of hydrogenotrophic complete dehalogenators. Subsequent FISH analysis revealed that under these conditions Dehalococcoides-like bacteria were greatly enriched
compared with the original chemostat culture. In
contrast, the relative and absolute abundance of these
bacteria clearly decreased under all the other enrichment
conditions. This correlation of Dehalococcoides-like
bacteria with complete dehalogenation using hydrogen
as electron donor is in agreement with previous reports
(Maymo-Gatell et al., 1997). With respect to electron
acceptors, it is certain that the Dehalococcoides-like
bacteria detected in this culture are capable of cDCE
dehalogenation. Indeed, other studies with this culture
also indicated the presence of cDCE-dehalogenating
Dehalococcoides (Cupples et al., 2003). However, we
suspect that the Dehalococcoides-like bacteria were also

involved in PCE dehalogenation because enrichment of
these organisms was observed in H2/PCE subcultures
(Fig. 4). One can argue that Desulfitobacterium-like
bacteria were responsible for PCE dehalogenation in
those subcultures because they were also enriched under
the same condition. However, active Desulfitobacteriumlike bacteria were not detected by FISH in the
chemostat, where complete PCE dehalogenation occurred. Nevertheless, we can not exclude the possibility
that different species of Dehalococcoides might be
present in this culture. Further studies are necessary to
verify our hypothesis and deﬁne the physiology of these
bacteria in this culture.
On the other hand, Desulfitobacterium-like bacteria
detected in this culture appeared to be capable of
incomplete PCE dehalogenation to cDCE because
enrichment of these bacteria (compared with the original
chemostat culture) was observed only in PCE-amended
subcultures but not in cDCE-amended ones. With
respect to electron donor requirements, Desulfitobacterium-like bacteria might be able to use both hydrogen
and acetate because they were enriched in both H2/PCE
and acetate/PCE subcultures. However, it is more likely
that acetate served as the direct electron donor since
acetate was detected in H2/PCE subcultures during all
transfers (0.5–1.0 mM). Additional evidence is that
Sporomusa-like bacteria, which are capable of converting hydrogen and carbon dioxide to acetate (Moeller et
al., 1984), were found in all hydrogen-receiving subcultures. The role of Desulfitobacterium-like bacteria as
acetotrophic dehalogenators in this culture is an
interesting ﬁnding because no Desulfitobacterium species
identiﬁed so far can use acetate as electron donor for
reductive dehalogenation, although a number of these
bacteria have been reported performing dehalogenation
of either chlorinated ethenes or chlorinated aromatic
compounds (Utkin et al., 1994; Bouchard et al., 1996;
Christiansen and Ahring, 1996; Gerritse et al.,
1996, 1999; Sanford et al., 1996). To date Desulfuromonas species are the only known organisms capable of
using acetate as electron donor for PCE dehalogenation
to cDCE (Krumholz et al., 1996; Krumholz, 1997; Sung
et al., 2003). The afﬁliation of Desulfitobacterium species
with acetotrophic dehalogenators suggests that these
bacteria might have a more versatile physiology than
previously reported.
In addition to Dehalococcoides and Desulfitobacterium, Sporomusa-like bacteria were also detected in this
culture. It is known that these bacteria are capable of
homoacetogenesis (Moeller et al., 1984). The Sporomusa-like bacteria present in this culture may also act as
homoacetogens because enrichment of these bacteria
was detected in all hydrogen-receiving subcultures
(Fig. 2), where concurrent acetate formation occurred
(data not shown). Sporomusa-like bacteria may also play
a role in reductive dehalogenation because it was

3963

previously reported that Sporomusa ovata was able to
reductively dehalogenate PCE to TCE (Terzenbach and
Blaut, 1994). However, the dehalogenation activity
observed in that study depended on concomitant
acetogenesis from methanol and carbon dioxide (Terzenbach and Blaut, 1994). Further physiology studies
are necessary to assess the role of Sporomusa-like
bacteria in reductive dehalogenation.
In terms of methodology, this study demonstrated the
usefulness of culture enrichment to characterize microorganisms involved in reductive dehalogenation. The
enrichment scheme in this study allowed enrichment of
the organisms directly accomplishing dehalogenation,
possibly due to the elimination of organisms involved in
benzoate degradation in the original culture. However,
this procedure may also enrich organisms that may not
use chlorinated compounds, such as Sporomusa-like
bacteria in this study.
Additionally, our results conﬁrmed the importance
and necessity of using a complementary quantiﬁcation
technique, such as FISH, when performing community
structure analysis with PCR-DGGE analysis. Several
limitations were observed with PCR-DGGE during this
study. First, PCR-DGGE ﬁngerprinting alone could not
provide quantitative information with respect to the
abundance of bacteria. This is largely due to the
potential intrinsic bias of the conventional end-point
PCR, which lowers the value of band intensity as a
measure for species abundance (von Wintzingerode et
al., 1997). Second, PCR-DGGE could lead to misleading results. For example, although the results obtained
from DGGE were largely in agreement with FISH
analysis, discrepancies were observed with acetate/
cDCE and acetate/PCE subcultures. DGGE analysis
indicated that both Dehalococcoides- and Desulfitobacterium-like bacteria were present in acetate/cDCE
subcultures, and that Dehalococcoides-like bacteria were
present in acetate/PCE subcultures. However, opposite
results were obtained from FISH. One possible explanation to this is that these bacteria were present, but not
metabolically active thus could only be detected by
DGGE but not by FISH because DGGE analysis in this
study was carried out with 16S rDNA of the microorganisms, while FISH targeted 16S rRNA. Theoretically this limitation can also be eliminated by
performing 16S rRNA-targeted DGGE analysis.
Further, DGGE ﬁngerprints of the dehalogenating
microbial community was to a great extent dependent
on the primer pairs used for PCR ampliﬁcation. Among
the several primer pairs we experimented with, BAC
341f and BAC 534r was the only one clearly reﬂecting
the shift of microbial community structure under
different enrichment conditions, and the other primer
pairs tested resulted in similar banding patterns among
different treatments. As a result, we were only able to
obtain DNA fragments of less than 200 base pairs in

length. Although the rDNA sequences retrieved contain
much speciﬁc phylogenetic information (V3 region),
they did not allow a highly robust phylogenetic analysis.
In summary, this study provided molecular evidence
for the presence of both hydrogenotrophic complete
dehalogenators, Dehalococcoides-like bacteria, and acetotrophic incomplete dehalogenators, Desulfitobacteriumlike bacteria, in one microbial community. This is one of
the few reports on the presence of different types of
dehalogenators in one microbial community capable of
PCE dehalogenation. Previously, Schlotelburg et al.
(Schlotelburg et al., 2002) reported on the presence of
Dehalococcoides and Dehalobacter restrictus in an
anaerobic bioreactor dehalogenating 1,2-dichloropropane. While evidence is increasing that Dehalococcoides
are widely distributed in microbial communities associated with complete dehalogenation and thus play a
predominant role in this process (Fennell et al., 2001;
Hendrickson et al., 2002), one wonders about the role of
incomplete dehalogenators, such as Desulfitobacterium
in this study. Do they have an ecological niche? How do
they interact with Dehalococcoides-like bacteria and
further impact the rate and extent of reductive
dehalogenation? Moreover, do similar interactions also
occur in environmental microbial communities? Further
investigations to characterize the interactions between
Dehalococcoides and Desulfitobacterium are required to
address these questions.

evidence was presented to indicate the
presence of both Dehalococcoides- and Desulfitobacterium-like bacteria in one microbial community
capable of reductive dehalogenation.
Dehalococcoides-like bacteria in the studied community are associated with complete dehalogenation of
chlorinated ethenes to ethene using hydrogen as
electron donor.
Desulfitobacterium-like bacteria are associated with
incomplete PCE dehalogenation to cDCE and
appear to be able to use acetate as electron donor.
Combination of conventional enrichment techniques
with DGGE and FISH was found a powerful tool for
identiﬁcation of key microbes involved in PCE
dehalogenation, correlation of functions of the
microbes with their phylogenetic identities, and in
situ detection of their activity.

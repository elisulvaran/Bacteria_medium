Abstract A mesophilic bacterium, strain An4, was isolated
from an underground gas storage reservoir with methanol
as substrate and perchlorate as electron acceptor. Cells were
Gram-negative, spore-forming, straight to curved rods, 0.5–
0.8 μm in diameter, and 2–8 μm in length, growing as
single cells or in pairs. The cells grew optimally at 37°C,
and the pH optimum was around 7. Strain An4 converted
various alcohols, organic acids, fructose, acetoin, and
H2/CO2 to acetate, usually as the only product. Succinate
was decarboxylated to propionate. The isolate was able to
respire with (per)chlorate, nitrate, and CO2. The G+C
content of the DNA was 42.6 mol%. Based on the 16S
rRNA gene sequence analysis, strain An4 was most closely
related to Sporomusa ovata (98% similarity). The bacterium
reduced perchlorate and chlorate completely to chloride.
Key enzymes, perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase,
were detected in cell-free extracts.

The GenBank accession number for the 16S rRNA sequence of
Sporomusa sp. is EF060193

Introduction
Perchlorate and chlorate are used in a wide range of
applications. Chlorate is used as an herbicide or defoliant.
Perchlorate salts have been manufactured in large quantities
and used as ingredients in solid rocket fuels, highway safety
flares, air bag inflators, fireworks, and matches (Renner
1998; Logan 2001; Motzer 2001). Perchlorate is chemically
very stable and has low reactivity even in highly reducing
environments (Logan 1998). Inorganic perchlorate salts are
generally soluble. Mishandling of these compounds has led
to harmful concentrations in soil, groundwater, and drinking
water supplies (Renner 1998; Urbansky and Schock 1999;
Hogue 2003).
Perchlorate is reported to interrupt human thyroid
hormone production (Urbansky 1998). Therefore, its
occurrence in dairy and breast milk are of major concern
(Kirk et al. 2005; Dyke et al. 2007; Dasgupta et al. 2008).
Although perchlorate is chemically stable, many studies
have proven that microorganisms can convert perchlorate to
chloride under anaerobic conditions (i.e., Attaway and
Smith 1993; Rikken et al. 1996; Bruce et al. 1999; Coates
et al. 1999; Herman and Frankenberger 1999; Giblin et al.
2000; Logan et al. 2001).
Many mesophilic perchlorate-reducing mixed and pure
cultures have been described, and so far, all of the isolates
obtained are members of the Proteobacteria, with the
majority of the isolates belonging to the Betaproteobacteria
subclass (Wallace et al. 1996; Bruce et al. 1999; Herman
and Frankenberger 1999; Logan 2001; Wu et al. 2001;
Wolterink et al. 2002; 2005; Weelink et al. 2008; Thrash et

Materials and methods

37°C. The culture was repeatedly transferred to fresh
medium when methanol and perchlorate were consumed.
Serial dilutions of the sample from the underground gas
storage were prepared in liquid media containing 20 mM of
methanol and 10 mM of perchlorate. The highest dilution
showing growth at 37°C was used for further study. The
culture was diluted in agar media (1.8%, w/v, Agar Noble)
in the serum vials. Colonies from the highest dilution were
picked, and serial agar and liquid dilutions were repeated
until a pure culture was obtained. The pure culture was
designated strain An4.
Cell morphology and purity were examined with a
phase-contrast microscope. Gram-staining was carried out
according to the standard procedure (Doetsch 1981).

Source of inoculum

Substrate utilization tests

The sample was obtained from the liquid phase of
underground gas storage reservoir in the period of gas
extraction as described by Ivanova et al. (2007). The dry
weight of the sample was about 700 mgl−1. It contained the
following minerals; Fe(II) (140 mgl−1), NH4+ (2.8 mgl−1),
K+ (2.6 mgl−1), Na+ (18 mgl−1), Mg2+ (4.4 mgl−1), Ca2+
(27 mgl−1), NO3− (<1 mgl−1), SO42− (3.6 mgl−1), and
Cl− (57 mgl−1). The pH of the sample was 6.8. Although
the initial temperature in the sampling place was around
60–65°C, after the injection of the cold gas (20–23°C), the
temperature became around 37°C (personal communication,
Dr. Anna Ivanova).

The ability of strain An4 to metabolize substrates was tested
in the bicarbonate-buffered medium. Substrates were added
from sterile anoxic concentrated stock solutions. To test
he use of potential electron acceptors on methanol, lactate,
and fructose, sodium perchlorate (10 mM), sodium chlorate
(10 mM), sodium sulfate (20 mM), sodium thiosulfate
(20 mM), sodium sulfite (5 mM), FeCl3 (10 mM), Fe(III)NTA (10 mM), Fe(III)-citrate (10 mM), anthraquinone-2,
6-disulfonate (AQDS) (20 mM), and sodium nitrate
(10 mM) were added to the medium. Fe(III)-NTA was
prepared as described by Caldwell et al. (1999).

al. 2010). Only recently, a (per)chlorate-reducing member,
Moorella perchloratireducens, belonging to the Firmicutes,
was isolated (Balk et al. 2008). This isolate is an
acetogenic, thermophilic, and Gram-positive species.
However, so far, perchlorate utilization has not been
reported for acetogenic bacteria in this phylum that grow
under mesophilic conditions. This report represents the
description of a mesophilic acetogenic (per)chloraterespiring bacterium. The isolation and characterization
of strain An4 from underground gas storage in Russia
are described.

16S RNA sequence analysis and G+C content of DNA
Culture medium
The culture medium for enrichment, isolation, and maintenance of strain An4 was prepared as described by Stams et al.
(1993), except that (per)chlorate was tested without the
addition of sulfide. Unless stated otherwise, all cultivations
were carried out at 37°C. The cultures were routinely grown
in 117-ml serum vials with butyl rubber stoppers and
aluminum crimp seals. The vials contained 50-ml basal
medium and a gas phase of 1.7-bar N2/CO2 (80/20%, v/v).
Concentrated stock solutions of substrates were prepared
anoxically, sterilized by filtration and added to the medium
to final concentrations of 5–20 mM. The pH of the medium
was 7. By varying the CO2 concentration in the headspace
and adding a few drops of 0.1 N HCl or NaOH per vial, the
pH of the medium could be adjusted within the range of
5.5–8.5. In all growth experiments in liquid medium, the
inoculum size was 1% (v/v).
Enrichment and isolation of strain An4
The enrichment culture was cultivated in a bicarbonatebuffered medium containing methanol and perchlorate at

For the phylogenetic characterization of strain An4, DNA
was extracted and purified using the UltraClean Soil DNA
kit (MoBio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PCR was performed with the bacterial primers 7f and 1510r
(Lane 1991) by using the Taq DNA polymerase kit (Life
Technologies) to amplify the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The
PCR products were purified with the Qiaquick PCR
purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing of the complete
16S rRNA gene was performed at Westburg Genomics
(http://genomics.westburg.nl). A total of 1,386 nucleotides
of the 16S rRNA gene were sequenced. The sequences
were checked with the alignment programs of the ARB
package (Ludwig et al. 2004), and a rooted neighborjoining tree (Escherichia coli 8, D83536 positions 38–
1427) was constructed using Dechloromonas hortensis
(DSM 15637) as an outgroup. On-line similarity analysis
of the 16S rRNA gene sequences was performed with the
BLAST program at NCBI and EMBL databases.
The G+C content of the DNA was determined by using
HPLC method described by Mesbah et al. (1989) at the
Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen

30 and 37°C as it was described by Kengen et al. (1999).
The assay mixture (1 ml) consisted of 50 mM Tris buffer
(pH 7.5), 0.5 mM MV, and an appropriate amount of
enzyme. The assay mixture was prereduced by a small
amount of a dithionite solution (0.2 M) until an absorbance
of 1.5 was reached, and then the reaction was started by the
addition of 10 μl of chlorate (0.4 M) or perchlorate (0.4 M).
Specific activities were calculated from the linear decrease
in absorbance, with an extinction coefficient of 9.7 mM−1
for MV. Chlorite dismutase activity was determined by
measuring the production of oxygen with a Clark-type
oxygen electrode (van Ginkel et al. 1996).

GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). Genomic DNA was
isolated according to the procedure that was described
previously (Cashion et al. 1977).
Analytical methods
Most substrates were measured by HPLC as previously
described (Stams et al. 1993). Gasses and alcohols were
measured by gas chromatography (Balk et al. 2003;
Henstra and Stams 2004). Perchlorate, chlorate, chloride,
thiosulfate, nitrate, and sulfate were analyzed by a HPLC
system equipped with an Ionpac AS9-SC column and an
ED 40 electrochemical detector (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA)
(Scholten and Stams 1995). Perchlorate showed a very
broad peak in the chromatogram. Therefore, the assessment
of perchlorate concentration was semi-quantitative. Perchlorate consumption was quantified based on the increase
in chloride formation. Chloride and chlorate measurements
by HPLC were very accurate. Sulfide was analyzed by
the method of Trüper and Schlegel (1964). The protein
content of the cell extracts was determined according to
the method of Bradford (1976) with bovine serum albumin
as a standard.
Growth was measured as the optical density at 600 nm
(OD600). Uninoculated medium served as a reference. The
results are representative of replicate experiments.

Bacterial cultures of strain An4, Sporomusa ovata, and
Sporomusa aerivorans grown on methanol in the
bicarbonate-buffered medium were harvested by centrifugation (14,500×g, 20 min, 4°C), and pellets were washed
with distilled water. Lipids from lyophilized cells were
extracted ultrasonically using a mixture of dichloromethane
(DCM):methanol of 2:1 (v/v), and this procedure was
repeated four times. The residue was saponified with 1 N
KOH in 96% of methanol by refluxing for 1 h and
subsequently neutralized and extracted with DCM. After
addition of internal standards, the “free” and “bound” lipid
extracts were methylated and silylated and subsequently
analyzed by GC and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
Accession numbers
The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain An4 has been
deposited in the GenBank database under the accession
number EF060193. The EMBL database accession numbers
of the strain most closely related to strain An4 is S. ovata
(DSM 2662) (98% sequence similarity).

Enzyme assays
Cell extracts used for enzyme assays were obtained from
cells grown in the medium supplemented with 20 mM of
methanol and 10 mM of perchlorate. Chlorate, perchlorate,
and nitrate reductase levels were measured with anoxic
techniques in stoppered quartz cuvettes, by monitoring the
oxidation of reduced methyl viologen (MV) at 578 nm and

Results
Isolation and morphological characterization
An enrichment culture that grew at 37°C in a perchloratecontaining bicarbonate-buffered medium with methanol as
the growth substrate was obtained from an underground gas
storage in Russia. The culture formed mainly acetate and
chloride as products, but no methane was formed. A pure
culture of perchlorate-reducing bacteria was obtained by
using the agar and liquid dilution methods. The pure culture
was designated strain An4 (=DSM 21435, =JCM 15643).
Strain An4 is a spore-forming bacterium, and the cells
are straight to curved rods (Fig. 1). In the stationary
growth-phase, they formed terminal endospores in clubshaped sporangia. When grown on methanol or fructose,
the cells were 0.4–0.6 μm in diameter and 2–8 μm in
length, and on H2/CO2, the cells were 0.4–0.6 μm in
diameter and 6–8 μm in length. Spores located terminally,
and cells stained Gram-negative.
16S rRNA analysis and G+C content
A phylogenetic analysis of the almost full-length 16S rRNA
sequence (1,386 bases) revealed that strain An4 is a
member of the genus Sporomusa within the family
Acidaminococcaceae of the order Clostridiales of class
“Clostridia” of the phylum Firmicutes of the domain
Bacteria (Garrity and Holt 2000) (Fig. 2).
The closest relative of strain An4 is Sporomusa strain
DR5 and S. ovata based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis
(99% and 98% sequence similarity, respectively). Because
Table 2 Stoichiometry and
fermentation products of strain
An4 grown on selected
substrates

strain DR5 was not deposited in a culture collection
(personal communication, Dr. Peter H. Janssen), we could
not study this strain for its physiology. Nevertheless, we
were able to compare strain An4 with S. ovata (=DSM
2662) and S. aerivorans (=DSM 13326) in several
physiological aspects (Table 1).
The DNA base composition (G+C) of strain An4 was
42.6 mol%.
Growth and substrate utilization
Strain An4 grew between 20°C and 40°C; optimum growth
occurred at 37°C. It grew optimally at pH 7. Strain An4
was able to grow on H2/CO2, CO, methanol, ethanol,
glycerol, n-propanol, n-butanol, glycine, alanine, sarcosine,
betaine, acetoin, choline, methyl amines, pyruvate, lactate,
fructose, succinate, and glutamate (Table 1). Table 2 shows
the stoichiometry and fermentation products of strain An4
grown on selected compounds. Strain An4 did not grow
well on formate, but in the presence of (per)chlorate or
nitrate, formate supported good growth. The following
substrates were tested, but not utilized for growth in the
absence or presence of perchlorate: glucose, cellobiose,
ribose, oxaloacetate, butyrate, glycolate, glycerol, and
citrate. When the isolate was grown with (per)chlorate,
the organic substrates were mainly converted to CO2, while
only small amounts of acetate were formed (Table 2). In the
absence of (per)chlorate, the product was mainly acetate.
The bacterium reduced perchlorate to chloride. The isolate
was not able to respire with sulfate, thiosulfate, FeCl3, Fe
(III)-NTA, Fe(III)-citrate, and AQDS. Strain An4 was also
able to cometabolically dechlorinate tetrachloroethylene

(PCE) to trichloroethylene during growth on methanol +
CO2 in a similar way as it was previously described for
S. ovata (Terzenbach and Blaut 1994).
During growth with perchlorate, the medium became
pink due to the presence of resorufin formed from resazurin
upon deoxygenation and when all the (per)chlorate was
consumed, the pink color disappeared again.
Testing (per)chlorate reduction by other members
of the genus Sporomusa
The ability of Sporomusa species, S. ovata (=DSM 2662)
and S. aerivorans (=DSM 13326) to reduce perchlorate was
tested either with lactate or with methanol. Both substrates

are utilized by the two strains of the genus Sporomusa
(Möller et al. 1984; Boga et al. 2003). However, S. ovata
and S. aerivorans were not able to reduce perchlorate or
chlorate to chloride.
Growth of these two strains in the medium with (per)
chlorate did not result in a change of product formation
with lactate as a substrate, which was the case for strain
An4 (Fig. 3, Table 2). Transferring and adapting the strains
several times to the medium containing perchlorate and
lactate or methanol did not result in a substantial reduction
of perchlorate to chloride. Although perchlorate and
chlorate were reduced by the strain An4, lactate was not
consumed completely. Probably, (per)chlorate utilization
inhibited further fermentative growth with the remaining
lactate.
Enzyme measurements
(Per)chlorate reductase activity could be demonstrated by
using reduced MV as the artificial electron donor. The
activity towards chlorate was approximately threefold
higher than the activity towards perchlorate (Table 3). The
pathway also appeared to involve the dismutation of
chlorite yielding chloride and molecular oxygen.
Lipids analysis
The fatty acid profile of strain An4 was not similar to S.
ovata and S. aerivorans while grown on methanol (Table 4).
Although the major fatty acids, iso-βOH-C13:0 and C16:1
Δ7, were present in all the strains, the composition of the
remaining fatty acids was quite different.

Discussion
A Sporomusa strain An4 that is capable of reducing (per)
chlorate to chloride was obtained from an underground
gas storage in Russia. The genus Sporomusa was created
in 1984 (Möller et al. 1984) to accommodate a number of
strains of anaerobic acetogenic bacteria distinguished by
having a Gram-negative cell wall and an ability to form
endospores, two properties whose coincidence is uncommon in Microbiology. In general, the members of the
genus Sporomusa can utilize a wide variety of electron
donors. Sporomusa has been isolated from a large variety
of habitats including anoxic sediments of freshwater
rivers, lakes, creeks, and ditches (Möller et al. 1984;
Hermann et al. 1987; Dehning et al. 1989; Sass et al.
1998), and anoxic soil from rice paddy microcosms
(Rosencrantz et al. 1999), from soils and silage (Möller
et al. 1984; Kuhner et al. 1997), from sugar beet factory

1985), from horse and cattle dung (Möller et al. 1984),
from the guts of wood-feeding termites (Breznak and
Switzer 1986; Breznak et al. 1988), and soil-feeding
termites (Boga et al. 2003). All Sporomusa species have
been described to gain energy for growth by the reduction
of carbon dioxide to acetate. The reduction of CO2 to
acetate occurs via acetogenesis, and acetogens utilize the
acetyl-CoA pathway as a terminal electron-accepting
energy-conserving CO 2-fixing process (Drake et al.
2006; Drake 2009).
Perchlorate and chlorate reductase activities of strain
An4 were active at 30 to 37°C. Strain An4 was also
able to reduce nitrate, and nitrate reductase activity
was detected (Table 3). Currently, we do not know the
genes encoding (per)chlorate reduction and chlorite
dismutation. Although microbial nitrate reductases have
activity with chlorate, it is not known whether perchlorate is a substrate as well (Shanmugam et al. 1992;
Bender et al. 2005). We tested and found that S. ovata
was also able to reduce nitrate, but it did not reduce
perchlorate.
More than 50 dissimilatory (per)chlorate-reducing
bacteria are now in pure culture, and this number
continues to increase (i.e., Bruce et al. 1999; Coates et
al. 1999; Wolterink et al. 2002; Weelink et al. 2008). (Per)
chlorate-reducing bacteria have been isolated from a
broad variety of environments, including contaminated
soils and sediments (Rikken et al. 1996; Wallace et al.
1996; Bruce et al. 1999; Michaelidou et al. 2000; Coates
and Achenbach 2004; Weelink et al. 2008). The bacteria
described to date belonged mostly to the Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and
Epsilonproteobacteria subclasses of the Proteobacteria,
but the majority are in the Betaproteobacteria subclass
and are members of the genus Dechloromonas or
Azospira (formerly Dechlorosoma) (Coates et al. 1999;
Achenbach et al. 2001). The isolation of strain An4
suggests that many other bacteria might be capable of
(per)chlorate reduction than have been considered up to
now.

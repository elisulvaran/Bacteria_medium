Adaptation of the autotrophic
acetogen Sporomusa ovata
to methanol accelerates the
conversion of CO2 to organic
products
Pier-Luc Tremblay, Daniel Höglund, Anna Koza, Ida Bonde & Tian Zhang
Acetogens are efficient microbial catalysts for bioprocesses converting C1 compounds into organic
products. Here, an adaptive laboratory evolution approach was implemented to adapt Sporomusa
ovata for faster autotrophic metabolism and CO2 conversion to organic chemicals. S. ovata was
first adapted to grow quicker autotrophically with methanol, a toxic C1 compound, as the sole
substrate. Better growth on different concentrations of methanol and with H2-CO2 indicated the
adapted strain had a more efficient autotrophic metabolism and a higher tolerance to solvent. The
growth rate on methanol was increased 5-fold. Furthermore, acetate production rate from CO2 with
an electrode serving as the electron donor was increased 6.5-fold confirming that the acceleration
of the autotrophic metabolism of the adapted strain is independent of the electron donor provided.
Whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomic, and biochemical studies revealed that the molecular
mechanisms responsible for the novel characteristics of the adapted strain were associated with the
methanol oxidation pathway and the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of acetogens along with biosynthetic
pathways, cell wall components, and protein chaperones. The results demonstrate that an efficient
strategy to increase rates of CO2 conversion in bioprocesses like microbial electrosynthesis is
to evolve the microbial catalyst by adaptive laboratory evolution to optimize its autotrophic
metabolism.

Acetogenic bacteria have a unique autotrophic metabolism that is being exploited for the development
of biotechnologies aiming at the production of commodity chemicals from C1 compounds like CO2
and CO1,2. During growth on C1 compounds, CO2 is used as an electron acceptor and is being reduced
to acetyl-CoA via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway3,4. Acetogens have been mainly employed as microbial
catalyst for the production of biofuels from the fermentation of syngas generated from industrial or
municipal wastes5. They also have been used for the production of commodity chemicals from CO2 and
electricity by microbial electrosynthesis (MES) in a bioelectrochemical reactor6–8.
Recently, the multiplication of genome sequences and the development of genetic systems for engineering several acetogens led to important progress in the characterization of their metabolism and in
the construction of microbial catalysts for industrial processes1,9–14. Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE)
which is initiated by applying an environmental stress on a microbial population to select for fitter
mutants15 can also be a powerful approach to develop readily beneficial phenotypic characteristics in
industrial strains16,17. For example, ALE has enabled the development of bacterial strains more tolerant to
products of interest like biofuels18–20 or faster at reducing electron acceptors involved in bioremediation

processes21. Furthermore, ALE in combination with whole-genome sequencing and transcriptomic sutdies is an efficient strategy to gain useful insights on bacterial metabolism17,22.
Methanol is a promising C1 compounds used as substrate for several bioprocesses producing organic
molecules (Schrader, 2009). Methanol can be oxidized anaerobically by acetogens with CO2 from the
environment as electron acceptor4,23,24. Metabolic breakdown by bacteria is a well-known route for the
quick elimination of toxic compounds with the purpose of limiting exposure25. Therefore, methanol,
which is a solvent inhibiting bacterial growth26–28, is a perfect substrate for an ALE experiment aiming at
applying a pressure to select acetogenic strains with faster autotrophic metabolism and higher tolerance
to solvent.
In this study, ALE was employed to develop a strain of the acetogen Sporomusa ovata growing significantly faster on methanol. The autotrophic metabolism of the adapted strain was also investigated
with H2 as the electron donor. Since S. ovata is one of the most efficient electroautotrophic species
reported in the literature29–31, the methanol-adapted strain was tested in a MES system to verify if a faster
autotrophic metabolism translated in better performance for the electroconversion of CO2 into acetate.
Whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomic, and biochemical studies were used to uncover the molecular
mechanisms responsible for the improvement of the autotrophic metabolism and for the higher tolerance
to methanol.

Results and Discussion

Adaptation of S. ovata for faster growth on methanol. Strains of S. ovata capable of grow-

ing faster with methanol as the sole source of carbon and electrons were developed by ALE (Fig. 1A).
S. ovata was chosen for this study because its genome has recently been sequenced and also because it
is an efficient microbial catalyst for biotechnologies like MES using C1 compounds as substrate12,29,30.
The wild type S. ovata was initially cultivated for two independent adaptation experiments in defined
minimal medium with 2% methanol. After a lag phase of 105.7 ±  7.2 hours, growth began and a 10%
inoculum was transferred into fresh methanol medium. Subsequent transfers were done after the cultures reached the mid-log phase to select for fitter mutants. The ALE experiment was completed over a
period of two months and stopped after 18 transfers since no further improvement of the growth rate
was observed. A resulting representative adapted culture was growing 5 times faster than the wild type
with a doubling time of 13.0 ±  1.1 hours compared to 64.6 ±  19.4 hours. Clones isolated from the adapted
cultures had comparable growth rates. A representative clone from the adapted culture #2 (met-T18-2)
(Fig. 1A) with a doubling time of 13.2 ±  0.4 hours was further characterized.

Growth of methanol-adapted S. ovata on H2-CO2, 0.5% methanol, and betaine. The growth

of acetogens on methanol requires the reduction of CO2 through the Wood-Ljundahl pathway4,32. To
determine if met-T18-2 could also grow better autotrophically with another electron donor than methanol, it was cultivated in a minimal medium with H2 and CO2 only. At the end of the log phase, the
OD545 of the methanol-adapted strain was 0.32 ±  0.00 compared to 0.24 ±  0.01 for the wild type indicating a higher capacity for biomass generation from CO2 (Fig. 2B). This observation suggests that the
adapted strain became more efficient at reducing CO2 through its central metabolism or more efficient
at synthetizing cellular components in autotrophic growth conditions.
To establish if the adapted strain develops a greater tolerance to methanol toxicity, the wild type and
the adapted strain were grown with methanol at a lower concentration of 0.5%. As expected, a higher
concentration of methanol was more toxic for S. ovata since the wild type, despite a long lag phase, was
growing 3.2-fold faster on 0.5% methanol with a doubling time of 20.9 ±  0.5 hours and 4-fold increase in

maximum OD545 compared to 2% methanol (Fig. 2C). In the case of met-T18-2, a slightly better doubling time of 12.2 ±  0.2 hours and a comparable final OD545 were observed with 0.5% methanol versus
2% methanol. These results indicate that the adapted strain is fitter than the wild type at both high and
low methanol concentrations. More importantly, the adapted strain clearly developed mechanisms to
be more tolerant to methanol toxicity since it grows similarly at high and low methanol concentrations
contrary to the wild type.
To verify if the faster growth phenotype associated to the methanol-adapted strain is specific to autotrophic growth and not to a faster metabolism in general, the wild type and the adapted strain were
grown on betaine which is the carbon and electron source generally employed for heterotrophic growth
and maintenance of S. ovata cultures in the laboratory (Fig. 2D). With betaine, the adapted strain had a
doubling time of 12.4 ±  0.3 hours and was growing slower than the wild type which had a doubling time
of 8.4 ±  0.1 hours. These observations suggest that the adaptation of S. ovata metabolism for autotrophic
growth on methanol has been done at the expense of its growth efficiency on heterotrophic substrate
like betaine.

MES of acetate from CO2. One of the most promising features of S. ovata as a microbial catalyst for
bioprocesses is its capacity to reduce CO2 to organic compounds with electrons coming from the cathode
of a MES reactor6,31. Interestingly, met-T18-2 was 6.5 times more efficient at reducing CO2 in a MES
system equipped with a graphite cathode poised at a potential of − 690 mV versus SHE than the wild type
with an average acetate production rate of 866.7 ±  373.5 mM m−2 day−1 compared to 133.5 ±  43.2 mM
m−2 day−1 (Fig. 2). As expected, the average current consumption density of − 2161.7 ±  1071.4 mA m−2
observed with the adapted strain was 6.8-fold higher than with the wild type − 320.1 ±  98.5 mA m−2.
Electron recovery in acetate was also slightly higher in the adapted strain 94.7 ±  2.1% compared to the
wild type 85.3 ±  8.3%. These observations provide additional evidence that the methanol-adapted strain
has become more efficient at reducing CO2 under diverse autotrophic conditions including the ones
prevailing during MES. Furthermore, the results presented here clearly demonstrate that the autotrophic
metabolism of microbial catalysts was an important bottleneck for previously published MES systems30
and that optimization via ALE or other molecular biology approaches can improve significantly MES
performance.

Figure 3. The ALE experiment. (A) Growth rate at different transfers on 2% methanol and mutations
detected after jump in the growth rate at transfer 4 and 9 and at the final transfer 18. (B) Growth curves
on 2% methanol with clones isolated from transfer 4, 9, 18, and the wild type. Each value and curve is the
mean of three replicates.

The involved molecular mechanisms. Whole genome sequencing was used to identify the mutations associated with the observed improvement in the autotrophic metabolism as well as with the higher
tolerance to methanol. Isolated clones from two independent S. ovata adapted cultures after the 18th transfer on 2% methanol were sequenced and had 33 mutations in common (Fig. 3A, Table S1). To establish
a clear correlation between those mutations and the observed improvement in the growth rate, genomes
of clones isolated from the 4th transfer and the 9th transfer were also sequenced. These transfers were
selected because they followed transfers where significant jump in growth rate were observed (Fig. 3).
A clone isolated from the 4th transfer had a longer lag phase and a doubling time of 23.5 ±  1.0 hours
which is 2.7 times better than the wild type, but still significantly slower than transfer 18 (Fig. 3B). A
clone isolated from the 9th transfer had a lag phase and a doubling time of 16.3 ±  0.5 hours closer to the
doubling time observed at transfer 18. Among the 33 mutations found in the 2 independent adapted
cultures sequenced from the transfer 18, 18 mutations were involved in the first jump observed before
transfer 4 and 13 mutations appeared in the second jump before transfer 9. The relative large number
of mutations found at transfer 4 combines with the mutations detected at transfer 9 and the two mutations appearing later suggest that a complex network of synergistic effects is required to improve the
metabolism of S. ovata sufficiently to simultaneously increase its tolerance to methanol and its capacity
for autotrophic growth.
Some of the 33 common mutations identified may not be specifically related to faster growth on 2%
methanol. Repeated exposure to exponential phase may have resulted in the application of a selective
pressure for mutations increasing cell fitness during this growth phase. Nevertheless, their presence in
two independent experiments suggests that even if those mutations could have appeared with other
electron donors following serial transfer during the exponential growth phase, they are still important
for faster growth and metabolism of S. ovata including for methanol-dependent growth as well as other
autotrophic growth conditions. Because of the absence of a genetic system in S. ovata, it is impossible to
establish clearly causality between the detected mutations and the observed phenotypes. Thus, based on
biochemical evidences as well as the current state of knowledge several common mutations possibly of
higher importance will be further discussed in regards to their involvement in faster autotrophic growth
and higher tolerance to methanol.
Among the 33 common mutations identified, some were located in genes involved in DNA replication
and rearrangement. At transfer 4, the gene topB2 coding for one of the two topoisomerase III of S. ovata
contained a 1bp deletion (Table S1). In E. coli, topB mutants present higher frequencies of frameshift
mutations33,34. At transfer 9, the gene polC1 coding for one of the two DNA polymerase III of S. ovata was
mutated. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) caused the substitution of a glutamic acid by a lysine
at position 587 in the polymerase/histidinol phosphatase-like domain (PHP) of the enzyme. In the DNA
polymerase III of Thermus thermophilus and Thermus aquaticus, this domain has an exonuclease activity
and is thought to proofread freshly-synthesized DNA35,36. The PHP domain of S. ovata PolC1 has all
the metal-coordinating residues required to carry out exonuclease activity and could also be involved in
proofreading37. The mutations in topB2 and polC1 are possible causes of increase in mutation frequencies
accelerating the adaptation of S. ovata to methanol.
Differential expression in the methanol-adapted S. ovata. Mutations were found in front or
into genes coding for proteins participating to the regulatory network of S. ovata including 4 transcriptional factors (Stc10, SOV_2c03990, WhiA, and SOV_2c04150) and 2 proteins (DosC and SOV_2c05090)
involved in the synthesis of cyclic di-GMP38 (Fig. 3; Table S1). The combination of those mutations might
have a significant effect on the transcriptome of the methanol-adapted strains. For instance, the complete
disruption of the GGDEF domain of DosC due to a 1 bp deletion and the SNP located in the GGDEF

domain of SOV_2c05090 could impact on the intracellular level of cyclic di-GMP, a second messenger involved in the transcriptional regulation of many cellular processes including biofilm formation
and motility39. Based on these observations, RNA sequencing was used to compare gene expression
on H2-CO2 in the methanol-adapted strain met-T18-2 to the wild type (Table S2 and S3). Genes that
were found to be differentially-expressed were involved in central metabolism and in biosynthetic pathways associated with autotrophic growth in minimal medium. Other differentially-expressed genes were
implicated in processes potentially related to an increase in the tolerance to methanol such as cell wall
maintenance, membrane transport, amino acids biosynthesis, and protein folding.

Adaptation of the central metabolism.

The pathway for methanol oxidation in acetogens has been
partially characterized in the thermophile Moorella thermoacetica4,40. In S. ovata, biochemical evidences
demonstrated that the first step of methanol oxidation is catalyzed by a corrinoid-dependent methyltransferase that transfers the methyl group of methanol to tetrahydrofolate (H4folate)24,41. A recent
proteomic study identified the two components of the corrinoid-dependent methyltransferase in the
closely-related species Sporomusa strain An442. It consists of MtaC, a corrinoid methyltransferase protein,
and MtaB, a methanol:corrinoid methyltransferase that transfers the methyl group of methanol to the
corrinoid bound to MtaC. Visser et al., 2015 also suggested that the second step of methanol oxidation
was catalyzed by a methyl-H4folate-methyltransferase that transfers the methyl group from methyl-MtaC
to H4folate. Subsequently, methyl group from methanol oxidation entered the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway
in combination with CO2 serving as electron acceptor to form acetyl-CoA4. S. ovata has genes coding
for enzymes catalyzing all the steps of the methanol oxidation pathway and of the Wood-Ljungdahl
pathway12 (Fig. 4).
The predicted carbon conversion efficiency to acetate of the anaerobic methanol oxidation pathway
is 150% with 2 moles of reduced CO2 coming from the environment for every 4 moles of methanol
consumed. With 0.5% methanol as the substrate, carbon conversion efficiencies were 129 ±  11% for the
adapted strain and 118 ±  16% for the wild type. The difference with the predicted carbon conversion
efficiency can be explained by the assimilation of a fraction of the carbon coming from methanol and
CO2 into the biomass. As expected, the adapted strain produced acetate faster than the wild type. The
acetate production rate was 6.1 ±  0.4 mM day−1 for the adapted strain with a methanol consumption of
9.5 ±  1.1 mM day−1 compared to the wild type producing 2.6 ±  0.2 mM day−1 of acetate and consuming
4.4 ±  0.8 mM day−1 of methanol.
Mutations and differential expression of genes of the methanol oxidation pathway and of the
Wood-Ljungdahl pathway that could contribute to the development of more efficient autotrophic metabolism were found in the adapted strains. A SNP causing the substitution of a valine by an alanine in the
N-terminal corrinoid-binding domain of MtaC was detected at transfer 9 (Fig. 4A, Table S1). Like in
Sporomusa stain An4, MtaC of S. ovata is probably involved in the first step of methanol oxidation and
its mutation suggests that this protein has been optimized for more efficient methanol oxidation and
faster growth.
The gene ackA coding for the acetate kinase responsible for the conversion of acetyl-phosphate to
acetate in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway3,43 was also mutated at transfer 9. A SNP caused the substitution
of the arginine at position 176 to a glutamine (Table S1, Fig. 4B). To establish if this mutation had an

impact on the acetate kinase, the acetate-forming activity of the enzyme was measured44 in whole cell
lysates of the wild type and of the adapted strain (met-T18-2) grown on H2-CO2. The acetate kinase
activity was 1.5 times higher in the adapted strain with 204.5 ±  29.4 nmol of NADP+ reduced min−1 mg
protein−1 compared to 137.5 ±  19.3 for the wild type. No statistically-significant differential expression
was detected for ackA between the adapted strain and the wild type. This suggests that the mutation in
AckA has a positive effect on the enzyme performance or stability that could lead to improvement of the
efficiency of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway.
Higher transcript abundance was detected for genes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway coding for
the methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein methyltransferase AcsE, for the corrinoid/
iron-sulfur protein large subunit AcsC, and for the corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein small subunit AcsD
(Fig. 4B, Table S2). AcsE catalyzes the transfer of the methyl group acquired by the tetrahydrofolate
cofactor from methanol to the cobalamin cofactor of the corrinoid iron sulfur protein (CFeSP) encoded
by acsC and acsD43. This reaction is at the heart of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and higher expression
of acsCDE might translate into better autotrophic metabolism in the methanol-adapted S. ovata strain.
acsCDE are predicted to be encoded within the same operon with other differentially expressed genes
including hdrC which is coding for the C subunit of the heterodisulfide reductase. hdrA, the gene coding for the A subunit of the heterodisulfide reductase which is located elsewhere in the genome (Table
S2) had also higher transcript abundance in met-T18-2. In methanogens, the heterodisulfide reductase
is involved in a flavin-based electron bifurcation mechanism coupling the reduction of CoM-S-S-CoM
to the reduction of ferredoxin with electrons from H245. Although its exact function is not known, the
transcriptomic data presented here suggests that the heterodisulfide reductase of S. ovata could also be
implicated in autotrophic metabolism.

Pyrimidines and vitamins biosynthesis. Many genes coding for enzymes participating in biosyn-

thetic pathways were differentially expressed in met-T18-2. This included the eight most highly-upregulated
genes all found in the same operon involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis (Table S2). In the laboratory,
S. ovata is maintained heterotrophically in a medium amended with 0.1% yeast extract which is known
to contain substantial amount of pyrimidine46. During the ALE experiment, the minimal medium used
for methanol adaptation did not contain yeast extract and thus S. ovata cells had to increase their capacity for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Pyrimidine nucleotides are involved in many cellular processes
including the biosynthesis of DNA, RNA, coenzymes, and of components of the cell wall47.
Genes related to the biosynthesis of thiamin and vitamin B12 had lower transcript abundance in
the adapted strain (Table S3). Since these two vitamins are provided in the medium used for S. ovata,
the adapted cells might have reduced the expression of the related biosynthesis pathways genes to limit
energy expenses under autotrophic growth conditions. In parallel, a gene coding for the vitamin B12
transporter BtuB had higher transcript abundance in the adapted strain further indicating that the cells
were favoring transport of exogenous vitamins over de novo biosynthesis.

Amino acids and osmolytes. Yeast extract is also an important source of amino acids and thus

it is not surprising that genes involved in biosynthesis of leucine, valine, and tryptophane had higher
transcript abundance in met-T18-2 in the absence of yeast extract (Table S1). This included nifJ1, a
gene coding for one of the two pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductases (PFOR) of S. ovata catalyzing the
reversible conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA48. During growth on methanol, PFORs of S. ovata are
likely to convert part of the acetyl-CoA produced by the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway into pyruvate49, a
precursor molecule in many biosynthetic pathways including amino acids. Other genes participating
in the degradation of glutamate, in the deamination of glutamine and asparagine, in the metabolism of
glycine, and in the synthesis of pyridoxal 5′ phosphate, a cofactor of multiple enzymes using amino acids
as substrates50, had lower transcript abundance in the adapted strain (Table S3). Moreover, multiple genes
associated with the acetoin metabolism had lower transcript abundance in the adapted strain. This could
be related to the role of (S)-2-acetolactate as a precursor molecule in both the acetoin metabolism and
the biosynthesis of amino acids. Repressing the expression of acetoin-related genes could increase the
flux of (S)-2-acetolactate toward amino acids biosynthesis.
Furthermore, three genes involved in amino acids metabolism or transport were mutated in the
adapted strains (Table S1, Fig. 3). Mutations were detected in ald2, a gene coding for one of the two
alanine dehydrogenases of S. ovata, in grd2, a gene coding for a subunit of a glycine reductase and in
putP, a gene coding for a sodium/proline symporter.
Beside protein synthesis, amino acids like proline, glycine along with its methyl derivatives, and glutamate are compatible solutes that can accumulate into the bacterial cells to confer tolerance to osmotic
stress, solvents, and thermal stress51–53. Mutations and differential expression of genes participating in the
metabolism of the osmoprotectants proline and glycine suggest that the adapted S. ovata is using them
to enhance its tolerance to methanol.

Cell wall and transporter.

Development of a higher tolerance to solvent in bacteria has been
associated with changes in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) content of the cell envelope54,55. Lgt2, a gene
coding for one of the two prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferases of S. ovata was mutated in the
methanol-adapted strain (Table S1). A SNP causing the substitution of the glycine at position 230 by a

glutamic acid appeared at transfer 4. This enzyme attaches a lipid to the preprolipoprotein anchoring it
to the cytoplasmic membrane in the first step of the synthesis of mature lipoprotein56. Moreover, rfbG,
a gene participating in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides specific to the O-antigen of LPS, had higher
transcript abundance in met-T18-2 (Table S2)57. On the contrary, arnT, a gene coding for an enzyme
modifying LPS by adding a 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose to the lipid A, had a lower transcript abundance in the adapted strain (Table S3)58. Based on these observations, the LPS profiles of the wild type
and of met-T18-2 were investigated (Fig. 5). Significantly less high-molecular-weight LPS were detected
in the adapted strain. Interestingly, a solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida strain also exhibits a similar
LPS profile54 suggesting that the modifications in LPS of S. ovata are involved in higher tolerance to
methanol.
Changes in membrane transporters and in the overall protein content of the cell wall are also associated with higher tolerance to alcohols25,55. The genomes of the adapted strains had five mutations in
genes coding for proteins involved in transport (Table S1, Fig. 3). Furthermore, multiple genes related to
transport function and cell wall maintenance were differentially expressed (Table S2 and S3) highlighting
the importance of those cellular processes for the development of an optimal S. ovata strain.

Chaperone proteins. Stress response to solvents involves chaperone proteins performing protein

refolding and preventing aggregation25,59. For example, exposing Clostridium acetobutylicum to butanol
resulted in the upregulation of genes coding for chaperones including dnaJ, dnaK and hsp genes60
Surprisingly, dnaJ, dnaK2, and hsp1 had lower transcript abundance in met-T18-2 (Table S3). A recent
study by Fan et al. suggested that a moderate increase in protein mistranslation and consequently in
protein misfolding could improve resistance to oxidative stress probably by activating the general stress
response61. The lower expression of genes coding for chaperone in the adapted strain might also cause
an increase in protein misfolding leading to a better response to methanol-induced stress.

Conclusions

Results presented here demonstrate that under stress, S. ovata can evolve to oxidize methanol faster
by modifying its central metabolism with the possible objective of lessening its exposure to this toxic
compound. In parallel, the same adapted strain developed a series of molecular mechanisms increasing
its tolerance to methanol including a modified cell wall, the possible use of osmoprotectants, and the
possible modulation of chaperone activity. This indicates that ALE can be employed to cause the apparition of more than one beneficial characteristic at the same time. With 33 conserved mutations appearing
throughout the ALE experiment and a large contingent of differentially expressed genes, it is clear that

a complex network of interactions is required for the simultaneous development of several phenotypic
traits in S. ovata cells.
Methanol is a promising C1 substrate for the development of biotechnologies producing multicarbon
commodity chemicals such as amino acids and polyhydroxyalkanoates27. One of the positive aspects of
acetogens like S. ovata compared to other methylotrophs is that they simultaneously reduce CO2 from
the environment when oxidizing methanol. This can be exploited to develop environment-friendly biotechnologies with high carbon conversion efficiencies using both methanol and the greenhouse gas CO2
as substrates.
Furthermore, S. ovata is the most efficient microbial catalyst for MES, a promising technology for
the production of commodity chemicals from the greenhouse gas CO2 and electricity30,31. Results presented here clearly indicate that adapting S. ovata to grow faster autotrophically on methanol produces
a strain also significantly more efficient at reducing CO2 to organic chemicals in a MES reactor. This
illustrates the potential of rational ALE strategies for the optimization of autotrophic microbial catalysts
for the electroconversion of CO2 into multi-carbon compounds as well as for other industrially-relevant
bioprocesses.

Materials and Methods

Organism source and growth conditions. Sporomusa ovata DSM 266262 was obtained from the

Deutsche Sammlung Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ). S. ovata strains were routinely maintained in the DSM 311 medium with 40 mM betaine under a N2-CO2 (80:20) atmosphere. For all growth
conditions presented in this study, casitone, sodium sulfide, yeast extract, and resazurin were omitted
from the 311 medium. When S. ovata strains were grown with H2 as the sole electron donor and CO2
as the sole electron acceptor and carbon source, the N2-CO2 atmosphere was replaced by a H2-CO2
atmosphere (80:20) at 1.7 atm. For MES experiments, cysteine was also omitted from the 311 medium.
Culture lag time was approximated as the time at which a regression line associated with the exponential growth phase reached the initial OD545 after the addition of the inoculum63.

The ALE experiment. S. ovata DSM 2662 was cultivated in two independent ALE experiments in
311 medium with 2% methanol as the substrate. After growth began, a 10% inoculum was transferred to
a fresh medium. The following 17 transfers were done when the culture reached the exponential phase.
After the 4th, 9th, and 18th transfer, the cultures were streaked on 311 agar plates to isolate clones. Identity
of the clones was verified by PCR.
Whole-genome sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted with Easy-DNA gDNA purification Kit
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) from 6 ml of 311 betaine cultures of methanol-adapted S. ovata strains
met-T4-2, met-T9-1, met-T18-2, and met-T18-3. The genomic libraries were generated with the TruSeq
Nano DNA LT Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego CA). Briefly, 100 ng of genomic DNA
diluted in 52.5 μ l TE buffer was fragmented with a Covaris E220 ultrasonicator (Woburn, MA). The ends
of fragmented DNA were repaired by T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow DNA polymerase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The Klenow exo minus enzyme was then used to add an ‘A’ base to the 3′ end of the DNA
fragments. After ligation of the adapters, DNA fragments ranging from 300 to 400 bp were recovered
by beads purification. The adapter-modified DNA fragments were enriched by three cycles-PCR. The
average size of dsDNA fragments in the libraries was determined with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
Sequencing was done with a MiSeq Reagent kit v2 (300 cycles) on a MiSeq (Illumina) platform with a
paired-end protocol and read lengths of 151 nucleotides. The sequencing reads were then trimmed with
Trimmomatic64 before being used for variant calling with breseq65. The reference genome for the analysis
was Sporomusa ovata DSM 2662 (NCBI accession ASXP00000000.1). All the samples had an average
coverage of at least 30X.
RNA sequencing. S. ovata DSM-2662 wild type and met-T18-2 were grown in triplicate in 100 ml

of 311 medium with H2 as the electron donor and CO2 as the electron acceptor and source of carbon.
After reaching the exponential phase, the whole cultures were centrifuged and resuspended in Max
Bacterial Enhancement Reagent (Life Technologies). Total RNA was then extracted with TRIzol Max
Bacterial RNA Isolation Kit (Life Technologies). Total RNA was further purified with RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with on-column DNase treatment. A Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit for bacteria (Illumina) was used to reduce the quantity of ribosomal RNAs present in the total RNA sample. The
sequencing libraries were prepared in triplicates using a TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina).
Sequencing was done with a MiSeq Reagent kit v2 (300 cycles) on a MiSeq (Illumina) platform with a
paired-end protocol and read lengths of 151 nucleotides. Reads mapping, normalization and quantification of transcript abundance was done from the RNA sequencing data with Rockhopper 2.0266. The
genome of S. ovata DSM-2662 was used as the reference for reads mapping. A log2 fold change ≥ 1.15
or ≤ − 1.15 was used as cutoff. q-values ≤ 0.015 (Table S2 and S3) or ≤ 0.02 (Fig. 3) were used as cutoff.
The RNA sequencing data have been deposited with the NCBI GEO database under accession number
GSE66194.

CO2 reduction to acetate by MES.

MES reactors consisting of three-electrode, dual chambered
systems were operated at room temperature with S. ovata grown in the cathode chamber as described
previously6,31. The graphite stick cathode (36 cm2) and anode (36 cm2) were suspended in 250 ml of 311
medium in two chambers separated by a Nafion 115 ion-exchange membrane (Ion Power, Inc., New
Castle, DE, USA). The cathode was equipped with a potentiostat (ECM8, Gamry Instruments, PA, USA)
at –690 mV versus SHE. The cathode chamber was inoculated with 100 ml of hydrogen-grown culture
of S. ovata wild type or met-T18-2. During the MES experiment, both the cathode and anode chamber
were continually bubbled with N2-CO2 (80:20).

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Methanol and acetate concentrations in S.
ovata cultures were measured with an HPLC apparatus equipped with a HPX-87H anion exchange column (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., California, USA) at a temperature of 30 °C, with 5 mM H2SO4 as the
mobile phase, and a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Detection was done with a refractive index detector.

Acetate kinase assay.

S. ovata cultures were grown under a H2-CO2 atmosphere until reaching
the exponential phase. Then,the bacterial cells were centrifuged, washed, and concentrated 10 times in
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 with 1 mM DTT before being sonicated. The acetyl-P to acetate activity of the
acetate kinase enzyme was measured in the whole-cell lysates with the method of Bowman et al. (1976)
linking the formation of ATP to the reduction of NADP+ via two reactions catalyzed by the hexokinase and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase67. Briefly, the reaction contained 100 mM Tris-Cl pH
7.4, 5 mM ADP, 10 mM MgCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, 1 mM NADP+, 2 mM DTT, 6 U of hexokinase, 3 U of
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and whole-cell lysate. The reaction was conducted at room temperature and was started by the addition of 10 mM acetyl-P. The extinction coefficient at 340 nm for
NADP+ is 6.22 mM−1 cm−1. Acetate kinase activity was measured as nmol of NADP+ reduced min−1 mg
protein−1. Protein concentration in whole-cell lysates was measured with the Pierce Coomassie Plus
Assay Kit (Life Technologies).

LPS extraction and SDS-PAGE.

LPS from 20 ml of H2-CO2-grown S. ovata cultures at an OD545 of
ca. 0.24 were extracted with the LPS extraction kit from iNtRON Biotechnologies (Korea). 5 μ l of LPS
from S. ovata wild type and from S. ovata met-T18-2 were loaded on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was
silver-stained with the SilverXpress Silver Staining Kit from Life Technologies.

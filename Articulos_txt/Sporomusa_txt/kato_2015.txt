Anaerobic degradation of lignin-derived aromatics is an important metabolism for carbon and
nutrient cycles in soil environments. Although there are some studies on degradation of ligninderived aromatics by nitrate- and sulfate-reducing bacteria, knowledge on their degradation under
methanogenic conditions are quite limited. In this study, methanogenic microbial communities
were enriched from rice paddy field soil with lignin-derived methoxylated monoaromatics (vanillate
and syringate) and their degradation intermediates (protocatechuate, catechol, and gallate) as
the sole carbon and energy sources. Archaeal community analysis disclosed that both aceticlastic
(Methanosarcina sp.) and hydrogenotrophic (Methanoculleus sp. and Methanocella sp.) methanogens
dominated in all of the enrichments. Bacterial community analysis revealed the dominance of
acetogenic bacteria (Sporomusa spp.) only in the enrichments on the methoxylated aromatics,
suggesting that Sporomusa spp. initially convert vanillate and syringate into protocatechuate and
gallate, respectively, with acetogenesis via O-demethylation. As the putative ring-cleavage microbes,
bacteria within the phylum Firmicutes were dominantly detected from all of the enrichments, while
the dominant phylotypes were not identical between enrichments on vanillate/protocatechuate/
catechol (family Peptococcaceae bacteria) and on syringate/gallate (family Ruminococcaceae bacteria).
This study demonstrates the importance of cooperation among acetogens, ring-cleaving fermenters/
syntrophs and aceticlastic/hydrogenotrophic methanogens for degradation of lignin-derived
aromatics under methanogenic conditions.

Lignin is a major component of terrestrial plants and is a highly complex heteropolymer consisting of
hydoxylated and methoxylated phenylpropanid units linked by various types of C–C and C–O-C bonds.
As lignin represents a significant part of input of organic compounds, its degradation is integral for
carbon and energy cycles in soil environments. Lignin is aerobically depolymerized by lignolytic fungi
and some bacterial strains, followed by mineralization of the resulting low-molecular-weight products

by soil bacteria1–3. Aerobic degradation of lignin-derived methoxylated monoaromatics, including vanillate (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoate) and syringate (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzoate), has been thoroughly studied4. For example, an aerobic vanillate- and syringate-degrading bacterium Sphingobium sp.
SYK-6 firstly convert vanillate and syringate into protocatechuate (PCA, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate) and
3-O-methylgallate (3-MGA), respectively, by O-demethylation reactions5. PCA is oxidatively decomposed
to pyruvate and oxaloacetate via the PCA 4,5-cleavage pathway6. 3-MGA is degraded through multiple
ring cleavage pathways and the resultant metabolites are further degraded via the PCA 4,5-cleavage
pathway7.
On the contrary, studies on anaerobic degradation of lignin and lignin-derived aromatics have been
limited, despite some studies suggesting that their anaerobic biodegradation was evident in various natural environments8–13. Acetogenic bacteria are the first anaerobes described to utilize methoxylated aromatics as the sole carbon and energy sources14,15. Acetogenic bacteria utilize the O-methyl group as the
carbon and energy sources, while they do not have the ability to degrade the aromatic ring structure.
Similarly, some sulfate-reducing bacteria and fermentative bacteria utilize the O-methyl group as carbon
and energy sources, and a part of them also have ability to decompose the aromatic rings16–19. Anaerobic
degradation of the O-demethylated derivatives of vanillate and syringate, namely PCA and gallate
(3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate), respectively, has been documented with nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing,
and fermentative bacteria. A nitrate-reducer Thauera aromatica and a sulfate-reducer Desulfobacterium
sp. were reported to anaerobically degrade PCA via the benzoyl-CoA pathway20,21. Fermentative bacteria,
such as Eubacterium oxidoreducens and Pelobacter acidigallici, were reported to anaerobically degrade
gallate via the phloroglucinol pathway22,23.
While methanogenesis is one of the most important microbial metabolisms in diverse anaerobic environments, including soil and freshwater/marine sediments, knowledge on methanogenic degradation
of lignin-derived aromatics, especially on microorganisms responsible for the decomposition, has been
quite limited. Kaiser and Hanselmann reported that microbial communities enriched from anaerobic
sediments completely degraded lignin-derived aromatics, including vanillate and syringate, with concomitant generation of CH4 (ref. 24). They demonstrated that the first step for methanogenic degradation
is acetate production with O-demethylation of the methoxy-group. However, microorganisms participating in the O-demethylation and following ring-cleavage reactions under methanogenic environments
were not identified.
In the present study, we enriched methanogenic microbial communities from rice paddy field soil
with either lignin-derived aromatics (vanillate and syringate) or a model aromatic compound (benzoate) as the sole carbon and energy sources. The microbial communities were further enriched on the
degradation intermediate compounds, namely PCA, catechol, and gallate. Microorganisms involved in
methanogenic degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics were then identified with microbial community analysis based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences.

Results and Discussion

Enrichment of methanogenic microbial communities on lignin-derived aromatics. Metha

nogenic microbial communities were enriched from rice paddy field soil using a freshwater basal medium
supplemented with different aromatic compounds. Either lignin-derived methoxylated aromatics (5 mM
of vanillate or syringate) or a control aromatic compound (5 mM of benzoate) were supplemented as
the substrates. After several weeks of cultivation, CH4 was produced in all of the cultures supplemented
with aromatics (Fig. S1). The amount of CH4 produced reached to 7 to 20 mmol l−1 within 2 month
cultivation. On the contrary, only trace amount of CH4 (less than 0.1 mmol l−1) was produced in the
cultures without supplementation of the aromatics (Fig. S1), indicating that most of CH4 produced in
the enrichment cultures was derived from degradation of aromatic compounds. Production of CH4
from the aromatic compounds by respective enrichments (after five successive subcultures) are shown
in Fig. 1A–C. It took more than one month to produce stoichiometrically expected CH4 in all cultures
tested. The amounts of CH4 produced from 5 mM of benzoate, vanillate, and syringate were 17.1 ±  0.5,
18.4 ±  0.3, and 20.1 ±  0.3 mmol l−1, respectively, and were approximate to the theoretical values (18.75,
20, and 22.5 mmol l−1, respectively) calculated from the following equations:

C 7H5O 2−(benzoate) + 7.75H 2O → 3.75CH 4 + 3.25HCO3− + 2.25H +,
C 8H7O 4−(vanillate) + 8H 2O → 4CH 4 + 4HCO3− + 3H +,
C 9H9O5−(syringate) + 8.5H 2O → 4.5CH 4 + 4.5HCO3− + 3.5H +.
These results suggest that the each enrichment culture completely degraded the aromatic compounds
into CH4 and CO2.

Detection of degradation intermediates from the enrichment cultures. Among short chain
alcohols and organic acids, only acetate was detected from the enrichment cultures throughout this

syringate were analyzed by HPLC with detection at 220 nm and 270 nm, respectively. The retention times
of compound I, II, III, IV, and V were 1.43, 2.40, 3.34, 1.53, and 0.98 min, respectively. UV/VIS and mass
spectra of compound I to V are shown in Figs S2 and S3.

study by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Acetate accumulated in the
enrichment cultures to 8 to 12 mM during methanogenesis, followed by the complete consumption of
the accumulated acetate (Fig. 1A–C), indicating that acetate is one of the important intermediates of
methanogenic degradation of the aromatic compounds.
In order to determine the degradation pathway of vanillate and syringate in the enrichment cultures,
intermediate metabolites produced during cultivation were analyzed by HPLC coupled with an electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). It should be noted that CoA-derivatives of aromatic
compounds could not be detected by our analytical protocol. In the vanillate enrichment cultures, two
peaks (compound I, II) appeared at day 10, followed by an appearance of another peak (compound III)
at day 24 (Fig. 2A). Based on the comparison of retention time, UV/VIS spectrum, and negative ESI-MS
spectrum with authentic compounds, compound I, II, and III were identified as PCA, catechol, and

(open squares, (A)) and gallate (filled circles, (A)) were supplemented with 5 mM at day 0. Catechol (filled

3-hydroxybenzoate (3-HB), respectively (Figs S2 and S3). Generation of PCA at day 10 suggests that
O-demethylation of vanillate is the first step of vanillate degradation. Catechol and 3-HB were appeared
to be produced by the decaroboxylation and dehydroxylation of PCA, respectively, probably as intermediates of methanogenic degradation pathway of PCA (discussed below). In the degradation of syringate,
two metabolites, compound IV and V, were found and identified as 3-MGA and gallate, respectively
(Fig. 2B, S2, and S3). These observations indicate that syringate is first converted to gallate with successive O-demethylation reactions via 3-MGA. In the benzoate enrichment cultures, no aromatic compound
other than benzoate were detected (data not shown), suggesting that benzoate is firstly converted to
benzoyl-CoA and then the ring structure is reductively cleaved via benzoyl-CoA pathway as reported25,26.

Enrichment cultures on the degradation intermediates. In order to further elucidate the mechanisms for degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics, the enrichment cultures on vanillate and syringate
were subjected to further enrichments with respective degradation intermediates. Enrichment cultures
on PCA and gallate were constructed with vanillate- and syringate-enrichments as the inoculum, respectively, and generated considerable amounts of CH4 within 40 days (Fig. 3A). Although enrichment cultures on catechol was also constructed using the vanillate-enrichments as the inoculum, the cultures
supplemented with 5 mM catechol produced only little amounts of CH4 with a long lag time (> 50
days, data not shown). Since cytotoxicity of relatively high concentration of catechol was considered as
the reason for the low methanogenic activity, another set of enrichment cultures was constructed with

supplementation of 1 mM catechol. In this case, methanogenesis started with approximately a 20-day
lag phase and plateaued at around 40 days of cultivation (Fig. 3B). After saturation of methanogenesis,
another 1 mM of catechol was added to the culture, which resulted in resumption of methanogenesis
with almost no lag time.
The amount of CH4 produced from PCA (5 mM), gallate (5 mM), and catechol (1 mM) were 15.5 ±  0.5,
14.4 ±  0.5, and 2.8 ±  0.3 mmol l−1, respectively, and were approximate to the theoretical values (16.25, 15,
and 3.25 mmol l−1, respectively) calculated from the following equations:

C 7H5O 4−(PCA) + 7.25H 2O → 3.25CH 4 + 3.75HCO3− + 2.75H +,
C 7H5O5−(gallate)+ 7H 2O → 3CH 4 + 4HCO3− + 3H +,
C 6H6O 2 (catechol) + 6.25H 2O → 3.25CH 4 + 2.75HCO3− + 2.75H +.
These results suggest that methanogenic microbial communities that completely degrade the respective intermediates of vanillate and syringate were successfully enriched.

Dominant microorganisms in the enrichment cultures. Microbial community structures of the
enrichments were assessed based on 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis to elucidate the microorganisms participating in methanogenic degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics. The summarized features of the bacterial and archaeal community analyses are presented in Fig. 4. All phylotypes detected
from each enrichment culture are listed in Tables S1 and S2.
Only 4 archaeal phylotypes were recovered from the enrichment cultures (Fig. 4A and Table S1). The
phylotype ArA-01 (98.9% identity to Methanosarcina vacuolata), which dominated in all enrichment
cultures, was the only phylotype classified as an aceticlastic methanogen. The phylotypes classified as
hydrogenotrophic methanogens, namely the phylotype ArA-02 (97.9% identity to Methanoculleus palmolei) and ArA-03 (97.5% identity to Methanocella arvoryzae), were also detected from all enrichment
cultures. These results suggest that both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis contribute to
methanogenic degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics.
The predominant bacterial phylotype in the benzoate-enrichments was the phylotype ArB-25 (Fig. 4B
and Table S2), which is classified into the class Deltaproteobacteria and has 99.0% identity to Syntrophus
aciditrophicus. S. aciditrophicus has ability to degrade benzoate via benzoyl-CoA pathway in syntrophic
association with methanogens27,28. In the benzoate-enrichment cultures, Syntrophus sp. appears to

decompose benzoate into acetate and H2/CO2, which is further converted into CH4 by aceticlastic and
hydrogenotrophic methanogens.
By contrast, almost no Deltaproteobacteria were recovered from the enrichment cultures with other
aromatic compounds. Instead, the phylotypes classified into phylum Firmicutes dominated in the enrichments supplemented with the lignin-derived aromatics and their degradation intermediates (Fig. 4B).
Among the Firmicutes phylotypes, the phylotype ArB-01 (99.6% identity to Sporomusa sphaeroides)
and ArB-02 (89.8% identity to Sporomusa paucivorans) were abundantly detected from vanillate- and
syringate-enrichments, but not from enrichments with their degradation intermediates. Sporomusa spp.
were reported to have the ability to acetogenetically grow on diverse array of methoxylated aromatic
compounds, such as vanillate, ferulate, and 3,4-dimethoxybenzoate, via respective O-demethylation
reactions29,30. These findings suggested that Sporomusa spp. contribute to the initial step of anaerobic
degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics in the enrichments, namely the conversion of vanillate and
syringate into PCA and gallate, respectively.
In the enrichments on vanillate and its degradation intermediates (PCA and catechol), the phylotypes
classified into family Peptococcaceae were dominant, while the dominant phylotypes varied among the
supplemented aromatic compounds (Fig. 4B and Table S2). The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA
gene sequences of representative Peptococcaceae isolates and the Peptococcaceae phylotypes detected in this
study is shown in Fig. 5A. The dominant phylotypes ArB-04 (96.8% identity to Pelotomaculum schinkii)
and ArB-06 (98.4% identity to Cryptanaerobacter phenolicus) were clustered into the Desulfotomaculum
subcluster Ih31. Microorganisms in the Desulfotomaculum subcluster Ih were characterized by their
ability to anaerobically metabolize various organic substrates in syntrophic association with hydrogenotrophic methanogens32. Furthermore, Desulfotomaculum subcluster Ih includes some strains that syntrophically degrade a range of aromatic compounds33,34 and was frequently detected as the dominant

bacteria in microbial communities that anaerobically degrade diverse aromatic compounds35–38. The
other dominant phylotype ArB-05 (97.9% identity to Desulfosporosinus auripigmenti) was separately
clustered from ArB-04 and -06 and affiliated with genus Desulfosporosinus (Fig. 5A). Desulfosporosinus
spp. were generally characterized as sulfate-reducing bacteria and its syntrophic metabolism with methanogens has not been tested39. However, all crucial domains for syntrophic metabolisms were found in
the genome of Desulfosporosinus meridiei, suggesting their possible ability to grow in syntrophic association with methanogens40. While there have been no reports on degradation of aromatic compounds
by Desulfosporosinus spp., sequences related to Desulfosporosinus were frequently recovered from various
aromatics-degrading microbial communities41–43. Taken together, it is very likely that the Peptococcaceae
phylotypes mainly contributed to the ring-cleavage of the vanillate and/or its degradation intermediates
via syntrophic interaction with hydrogenotrophic methanogens.
The phylotypes classified into family Ruminococcaceae were dominant in the enrichments with syringate and gallate (Fig. 4B and Table S2). The phylogenetic tree for family Ruminococcaceae is shown in
Fig. 5B. One of the phylotypes, ArB-08, was not clustered with known Ruminococcaceae isolates and
has only quite low 16S rRNA gene sequence identity to isolated microorganisms (92.0% identity to
Acetivibrio sp. 6–13). The other dominant phylotype ArB-09 (97.1% identity to Intestinimonas butyriciproducens) was placed within the “Clostridium cluster IV44,45”. Although the closest relative of ArB09 (I. butyriciproducens) has not been reported to degrade aromatic compounds46, some strains in the
Clostridium cluster IV were reported to fermentatively decompose diverse aromatic compounds. For
example, Flavonifractor plautii (formerly Clostridium orbiscindens) has the ability to degrade flavonoids
via phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) as the intermediate47. Most notably, Sporobacter termitidis
grows exclusively on a limited range of methoxylated aromatic compounds, including syringate and
vanillate, through their O-demethylation and ring cleavage17. These reports support the assumption that
the Ruminococcaceae phylotypes dominant in the syringate- and gallate-enrichments mainly contributed
to their ring cleavage.

Proposed model for methanogenic degradation of vanillate and syringate. The proposed

models for methanogenic degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics are shown in Fig. 6. Analysis on
degradation intermediates and microbial communities in the enrichments suggested that vanillate is firstly
converted into PCA by Sporomusa spp. with acetate generation via O-demethylation reactions (Fig. 6A).
Peptococcaceae bacteria (Desulfotomaculum subcluster Ih and/or Desulfosporosinus spp.) are the plausible
candidates for decomposing PCA into acetate and H2/CO2, which are the substrates for methanogenesis
by aceticlastic methanogens (Methanosarcina spp.) and hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanoculleus
and Methanocella spp.), respectively. Anaerobic degradation of PCA has been investigated for some

nitrate- and sulfate-reducing bacteria20,21, by which PCA is firstly activated to protocatechuyl-CoA and
reductively dehydroxylated to 3-HB-CoA, followed by ring cleavage via the (3-hydroxy)benzoyl-CoA
pathway. However, we could not confirm the existence of this degradation pathway in the enrichment
cultures, because CoA-derivatives of aromatic compounds could not be detected by our analytical protocol. Instead, catechol and 3-HB were detected as the possible intermediate compounds through degradation of PCA (Fig. 2A). Although there have been no reports on microbial enzymes that dehydroxylate
PCA into 3-HB under anoxic conditions, it might be possible that certain bacteria utilize such reaction
followed by CoA activation and ring cleavage via (3-hydroxy)benzoyl-CoA pathway. While enzymatic
activities to generate catechol by decarboxylation of PCA were reported for some anaerobic microorganisms48,49, further catechol degradation routes have not been identified. Some nitrate- and sulfate-reducing
bacteria were reported to decompose catechol20,50. These bacteria initially convert catechol into PCA by
carboxylation, followed by activation with CoA-ligation, dehydroxylation and reductive ring cleavage
via the (3-hydroxy)benzoyl-CoA pathway. Although there are some reports on anaerobic degradation
of catechol under methanogenic conditions51–53, the responsible microorganisms and the degradation
pathway were not identified.
As in the case of vanillate, the first step of syringate degradation appears to be acetogenic
O-demethylation catalyzed by Sporomusa spp. (Fig. 6B). The demethoxylated product, gallate, seems to
be further decomposed into acetate and H2/CO2 mainly by Ruminococcaceae bacteria. Anaerobic degradation of gallate were reported for some fermenting bacteria, including E. oxidoreducens, which is classified into Firmicutes and distantly related to the Ruminococcaceae phylotypes detected in this study22,23.
E. oxidoreducens initially converts gallate into trihydroxybenzene by decarboxylation reaction, followed
by ring cleavage via the phloroglucinol pathway22. Although the decarboxylated products of gallate were
not detected in this study, it is highly possible that the trihydroxybenzene degradation is much faster
than its generation.

Concluding remarks. In this study, we successfully enriched methanogenic microbial communities
that decompose the lignin-derived monoaromatics, namely syringate and vanillate. This study is the first
to demonstrate that cooperation of microorganisms with a diverse range of trophic groups are required
for methanogenic degradation of the lignin-derived aromatics. The initial step appears to be catalyzed
by Sporomusa spp. that generate acetate via O-demethylation of the methoxylated aromatics. The resultant demethoxylated aromatics were decomposed into acetate and H2/CO2 by Firmicutes bacteria, while
the bacterial groups responsible for PCA (family Peptococcaceae) and gallate (family Ruminococcaceae)
were not identical. Finally, both aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens generate methane from
acetate and H2/CO2, respectively. Although the details in the pathway of aromatic ring cleavage have
not been characterized, isolation of aromatics-degrading Peptococcaceae and Ruminococcaceae strains
identified in this study followed by genomic and enzymatic studies will shed light on novel aspects of
methanogenic degradation of lignin-derived aromatics in anaerobic environments.

Methods

Enrichment cultures of methanogenic microbial communities. Methanogenic microbial com-

munities were enriched in serum bottles (68 ml in capacity) filled with 20 ml of a bicarbonate- and
HEPES-buffered freshwater basal medium (pH 7.0)54 supplemented with aromatic compounds (benzoate, vanillate, or syringate) as a substrate. The cultures without supplementation of organic substrates
were also prepared as a no-amendment control. Approximately 50 mg (wet weight) of rice paddy field soil
was inoculated as a microbial source. The cultures were incubated at 30 °C under an atmosphere of N2/
CO2 [80:20 (v/v)] without shaking. When methanogenesis reached a plateau, 0.5 ml of culture solution
was transferred to the fresh media. Enrichment cultures on PCA/catechol and gallate were constructed
in the same medium with the vanillate- and syringate-enrichments as the inoculum, respectively. After
more than three passages, the enrichment cultures were subjected to chemical and phylogenetic analyses.
All culture experiments were conducted in triplicate.

Chemical analyses. The partial pressure of CH4 was determined using a gas chromatograph (GC-

2014, Shimadzu) as described previously55. The concentrations of organic acids were determined using
a HPLC (D-2000 LaChrom Elite HPLC system, HITACHI) as described previously56. To identify metabolic intermediates, the authentic compounds and supernatant of enrichment cultures were analyzed by
HPLC (ACQUITY UPLC system, Waters) coupled with ESI-MS (ACQUITY TQ detector, Waters) using
a TSKgel ODS-140HTP column (2.1 by 100 mm, Tosoh) as described previously57. In the HPLC analysis,
the mobile phase was a 90:10 (v/v) water:acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Formic acid (0.1%) was
added to the mobile phase solvent as a means of increasing ionization efficiency for ESI-MS. Degradation
products of vanillate and syringate were detected at the wavelength of 220 nm and 270 nm, respectively. Wavelength for the detection and the retention times of authentic compounds were described in
Figs S2 and S3. In the ESI-MS analysis, mass spectra were obtained by negative and positive modes with
the following settings: capillary voltage, 3.0 kv; cone voltage, 10 to 40 V; source temperature, 120 °C; desolvation temperature, 350 °C; desolvation gas flow rate, 650 liter h−1; and cone gas flow rate, 50 liter h−1.

Phylogenetic analyses. Microbial DNA was extracted with the FAST DNA Spin Kit for soil (MP
Biomedicals) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragments for clone library analyses was conducted as described previously58, with primer sets of U515f and
U1492r for bacteria and A25f and A958r for archaea59. The sequences obtained were assigned to each
phylotype using BLASTClust program60 with a cut-off value of 97% sequence identity. Classification of
phylotypes was performed using the Classifier program in the Ribosomal Database Project database61.
The sequence of each phylotype was compared to those stored in the GenBank nucleotide sequence
database using the BLAST program60 to infer the closest relatives. Phylogenetic trees were constructed
by the neighbor-joining method62 using program MEGA63. The bootstrap resampling method64 was used
with 1000 replicates to evaluate the robustness of the phylogenetic trees.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The nucleotide sequence data reported here have been
submitted to GenBank under Accession No. LC036665–LC036702.

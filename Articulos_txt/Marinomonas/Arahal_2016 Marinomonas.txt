A novel Gram-staining-negative, chemoorganotrophic, moderately halophilic, strictly aerobic
bacterium, strain MED121T, was isolated from a seawater sample collected at the Blanes Bay
Microbial Observatory in the north-western Mediterranean Sea. Analysis of its 16S rRNA gene
sequence, retrieved from the whole-genome sequence, showed that this bacterium was most
closely related to Marinomonas dokdonensis and other Marinomonas species (96.3 and
93.3â€“95.7 % sequence similarities, respectively), within the family Oceanospirillaceae. Strain
MED121T was included into a whole-genome sequencing study and, subsequently, it was
characterized using a polyphasic taxonomic approach. It was found to be oxidase and catalase
positive, its cells are cocci to short rods, it does not ferment carbohydrates and does not reduce
nitrate to nitrite or gas and it requires at least 2.5 % (w/v) marine salts and tolerates up to 7 %
(w/v) salts. Its major cellular fatty acids in order of abundance are C16 : 1!7c/C16 : 1!6c,
C18 : 1!7c, C16 : 0 and C10 : 0 3-OH. Its genome had an approximate length of 5.1 million bases
and a DNA G+C content equal to 40.9 mol%. Analysis of the annotated genes reveals the
capacity for the synthesis of ubiquinone 8 (Q8) and the polar lipids phosphatidylglycerol and
phosphatidylethanolamine, in agreement with other members of the genus. All the data collected
supported the creation of a novel species to accommodate this bacterium, for which the name
Marinomonas blandensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is MED121T (=CECT
7076T=LMG 29722T).

Gammaproteobacteria is one of the dominant groups of
marine bacterioplankton, together with Alphaproteobacteria
and Bacteroidetes, as detected by molecular biology techniques
(Giovannoni & Rappe, 2000). In Blanes Bay, north-western
Mediterranean Sea, Gammaproteobacteria account for up to
8 % (and occasionally 50 %) of the total bacterial community
as shown by catalysed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ
hybridization (Alonso-Saez et al., 2007). Phylogenetic analysis

The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the 16S rRNA gene
and whole-genome sequences of Marinomonas blandensis MED121T
are DQ403809 and AANE00000000, respectively.

of cultured isolates and phylotypes detected by molecular
biology techniques further revealed that Gammaproteobacteria
in Blanes Bay consist of a diverse array of bacteria belonging
to genera such as Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Vibrio,
Marinomonas and Marinobacter, as well as the SAR86 and
NOR5 clades (Alonso-Saez et al., 2007; Lekunberri et al.,
2014). As a result of the effort to characterize the culture collection of marine bacteria isolated at the Blanes Bay Microbial
Observatory (Arahal et al., 2007; Pinhassi et al., 2007, 2009), a
number of novel Gammaproteobacteria were also found. One
among them, strain Marinomonas sp. MED121T, was subsequently selected for complete sequencing of its genome as
part of a survey of phylogenetically and phenotypically

water was spread onto ZoBell agar plates prepared from seawater from the Bay of Blanes (indicating an abundance of
approximately 1103 c.f.u. ml 1). Strain MED121T was one
of the bacteria that exhibited an active growth response to
ATP enrichment in this seawater where bacterial growth is
typically limited by the availability of P. After primary isolation
and purification, strain MED121T was cultivated at room temperature on the same medium and stored at 80  C in
ZoBellâ€™s medium with 25 % (v/v) glycerol.

distinct bacteria thriving in the marine environment. The
genus Marinomonas, a member of the family Oceanospirillaceae, contains above 20 species, distributed worldwide in
marine environments, including temperate, polar and subpolar regions in both hemispheres. Marinomonas species are
strictly aerobic chemoorganotrophs and motile by polar flagella and most of them require salt for growth.
In the present study, we describe a novel bacterium, strain
MED121T, isolated from a surface seawater sample from the
Blanes Bay Microbial Observatory in the north-western Mediterranean Sea (41 40Â¢ N 2 48Â¢ E) collected on 20 March 2001.
The sample was enriched with 0.6 ÂµM P (final concentration,
added as ATP), and was incubated for 72 h at 15  C in the
dark. For strain isolation, 0.1 ml of a 100 dilution of sample

The complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain MED121T

When necessary, additional sequences were retrieved from the
GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases. Alignments were corrected
manually based on secondary structure information. Sequence
similarities were calculated in ARB based on sequence similarities without the use of an evolutionary substitution model. A
phylogenetic analysis using alternative treeing methods (maximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood and distance matrix)
and data subsets was performed using the appropriate ARB
tools (Ludwig et al., 2004).
The highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to strain
MED121T corresponded to Marinomonas dokdonensis
DSW10-10T, Marinomonas brasilensis R-40503T and Marinomonas posidonica IVIA-Po-181T with 96.3, 95.7 and 95.6 %
pairwise similarity, respectively. These values are low enough
to prove the taxonomic novelty of strain MED121T and the
phylogenetic tree confirms its association as an independent
lineage within the genus Marinomonas (Fig. 1).
For routine cultivation, either Marine Agar or Marine Broth
(Difco) at 26  C, 24â€“48 h, has been used. The type strains of
the following other Marinomonas species were included for
comparison and characterized in parallel: Marinomonas
alcarazii CECT 7730T, Marinomonas aquimarina CECT
5080T, Marinomonas aquiplantarum CECT 7732T, Marinomonas balearica CECT 7378T, Marinomonas communis
CECT 5003T, Marinomonas foliarum CECT 7731T, Marinomonas mediterranea CECT 4803T, Marinomonas pollencensis
CECT 7375T, Marinomonas posidonica CECT 7376T, Marinomonas rhizomae CECT 7377T, Marinomonas spartinae
CECT 8886T and Marinomonas vaga CECT 5004T.
For details on cell morphology and size, cells were grown at
21  C in Marine Broth (Difco) until early logarithmic phase
(24â€“48 h incubation), when cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde and filtered onto 0.2 Âµm pore size polycarbonate filters
(Nuclepore) pretreated with a drop of poly-L-lysine (0.1 %
solution). Samples were treated by sequential ethanol dehydration steps, critical point drying with CO2 and silver coating and viewed with a HITACHI S-3500N scanning
electron microscope. As seen in Fig. 2, cells of strain
MED121T appear as cocci to rods, about 1.0 Âµm in diameter
and 1.0â€“2.0 Âµm in length. Colony morphology and pigmentation were determined on Marine Agar incubated at 26  C
for 48 h.
Methods to determine temperature and salinity range, ionic
requirements, oxidase and catalase activities, ability to
hydrolyse casein, gelatin, starch, alginate, Tween 80 and
DNA and growth with sole carbon and energy sources have
been described previously (Macian et al., 2005). Other tests
(nitrate reduction to nitrite or N2, indole from tryptophan,
aesculin and gelatin hydrolysis, b-galactosidase activity, urease, glucose fermentation and arginine dihydrolase) were
performed with API 20NE strips (bioMerieux) which were
inoculated with cell suspensions on Marine Cation Supplement 1558 amended fluids (Farmer III & Hickman-Brenner, 1992). API ZYM (bioMerieux) gallery was used for
testing of enzyme activities of the strain according to the
5546

manufacturerâ€™s instructions except for the inoculation as
mentioned above. All tests were determined in duplicate.
Strain MED121T is aerobic, oxidase and catalase positive. It
required seawater-based media for growth and was unable
to grow on Salt Tolerance Agar [1 % (w/v) tryptone, 0.3 %
(w/v) yeast extract and 1.5 % (w/v) agar] with the addition
of Na+ or K+ chloride. However, growth was obtained
when Na+ was added together with divalent ions (Mg2+ or
Ca2+) or when all four cations were present in the medium.
The salinity range supporting growth on diluted Marine
Agar or in Marine Agar supplemented with NaCl as
reported in Macian et al. (2005) was between 2.5 and 7 %
(w/v) total salts. Thus, it is a slight halophile with complex
ionic requirements. Other phenotypic features are given in
Table 1 and in the species description.
Utilization of sugars, alcohols and organic acids as sole carbon and energy sources was analysed in Basal Medium Agar
[50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 19 mM NH4Cl, 0.33 mM K2
HPO4.3H2O and 0.1 mM FeSO4.7H2O on half-strength
Artificial Seawater (ASW) solidified with 1.3 % (w/v) Purified Agar (Oxoid); Baumann & Baumann (1981)]. Compounds were added at 2 g l 1. Positive control plates were
prepared with 5 g l 1 yeast extract while negative control
media consisted of Basal Medium Agar (BMA). Growth was
monitored for 12 days. Strain MED121T was the only one
in the assay that gave negative to all sources (except for the
positive control plate) (Table 1).
Cellular fatty acid composition, according to standard protocols as described for the MIDI Microbial Identification System, was obtained at the CECT following previously
described procedures (Sasser, 1990). The strains were cultured on Marine Agar and incubated at 26  C for 24 h. Fatty
acid methyl ester profiles of the isolates are shown in Table 2
along with the ones of the reference type strains listed above

and analysed in parallel. While presenting the main fatty
acids that are displayed by other Marinomonas species, the
profile of strain MED121T differs from them in the relative
abundance of the two major fatty acids, the presence of

contain phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine as main phospholipids while diphosphatidylglycerol
is not found in any of them: Marinomonas arctica (Zhang
et al., 2008), Marinomonas hwangdonensis (Jung et al.,
2012), Marinomonas mangrovi (Zhang & Margesin, 2015),
Marinomonas polaris (Gupta et al., 2006), Marinomonas
pontica (Ivanova et al., 2005) and Marinomonas profundimaris (Bai et al., 2014). Regarding the main quinone type,
genomic information sustains the ability of strain MED121T
to synthetize ubiquinone 8 (Q8), based on the presence of
the gene coding for octaprenyl diphosphate synthase (E
2.5.1.90), but not enzymes able to synthesize larger quinone
polyisoprenoids. The same is found in the genomes of nine
other Marinomonas species.

Whole-genome sequencing of strain MED121T was carried
out by the J. Craig Venter Institute through the Gordon and
Betty Moore foundation initiative in Marine Microbiology. It
resulted in an annotated genome size of approximately 5.15
Mbp (4696 putative ORF) with a G+C content of 40.9 mol%,
which is very close to the lower limit of the range given in the
emended description of the genus, 41â€“50 mol% (Espinosa
et al., 2010). To date, the genome of strain MED121T consists
of 47 contigs (AANE01000001â€“AANE01000047) organized
into 9 scaffolds (CH672429â€“CH672437). Annotation by the
NCBI Prokaryotic Genomes Automatic Annotation Pipeline
Group gave a total of 4820 proteins.

All data gathered support that strain MED121T represents a
novel species in the genus Marinomonas, well delineated by
phylogenetic analysis and phenotypically differentiated
from other species, as reported in Tables 1 and 2, for which
we propose Marinomonas blandensis sp. nov.

The genome of strain MED121T contains all genes needed
for phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine
synthesis but lacks the cardiolipin synthase gene needed for
the synthesis of diphosphatidylglycerol. These synthetic
abilities are in agreement with the finding that the six Marinomonas species so far studied for polar lipid composition

They are Gram-staining-negative, strictly aerobic, chemoorganotrophic bacteria, which are oxidase and catalase positive. Cells are cocci to short rods about 1.0 Âµm in diameter
and 1.0â€“2.0 Âµm in length. Gas vesicles are not observed. It
produces vaguely coloured with greenish tinge semi-transparent colonies. It does not ferment carbohydrates. It does
not reduce nitrate to nitrite or gas, requires at least 2.5 % (w/
v) marine salts and tolerates up to 7 % (w/v) salts. There is a
positive growth from 15 to 28  C. No growth is detected at 4
or 37  C. It hydrolyses casein, gelatin, starch (weakly) and
DNA. It does not hydrolyse alginate or agar. It is negative for
arginine dihydrolase, ornithine decarboxylase, urease, aesculin hydrolysis and indole production from tryptophan. It is
positive for b-galactosidase.
It does not utilize any of the compounds tested as single carbon and energy source: acetate, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine,
t-aconitate, L-alanine, g-aminobutyric acid, L-arabinose,
L-arginine, L-aspartate, butyrate, cellobiose, citrate, L-citrulline, D-fructose, fumarate, D-galactose, D-galacturonate, Dgluconate, D-glucose, D-glucuronate, L-glutamate, glycerol,
glycine, L-histidine, DL-b-hydroxybutyrate, m-inositol, 2ketoglutarate, lactate, lactose, L-leucine, L-lysine, malate,
maltose, D-mannitol, D-mannose, melibiose, L-ornithine,
propionate, putrescine, pyruvate, L-rhamnose, D-ribose, Dsaccharate, salicin, L-sarcosine, L-serine, D-sorbitol, succinate, sucrose, L-threonine, trehalose, L-tyrosine and
D-xylose.
It is positive in API ZYM to alkaline phosphatase and leucine arylamidase. It is negative to the other enzymatic activities of this miniaturized system.
Its major cellular fatty acids in order of abundance are
C16 : 1!7c/C16 : 1!6c, C18 : 1!7c, C16 : 0 and C10 : 0 3-OH. The
whole pattern and relative abundance is given in Table 2.
The DNA G+C content is 40.9 mol% (draft genome
sequence).
The type strain MED121T (=CECT 7076T=LMG 29722T)
was isolated from Mediterranean Sea surface water.

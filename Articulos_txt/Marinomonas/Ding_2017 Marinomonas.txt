Abstract: A novel β-1,3-galactosidase, designated as MaBGA (β-galactosidase from Marinomonas sp.
BSi20414), was successfully purified to homogeneity from Marinomonas sp. BSi20414 isolated from
Arctic sea ice by ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion exchange chromatography, resulting
in an 8.12-fold increase in specific activity and 9.9% recovery in total activity. MaBGA displayed
its maximum activity at pH 6.0 and 60 ◦ C, and maintained at least 90% of its initial activity over
the pH range of 5.0–8.0 after incubating for 1 h. It also exhibited considerable thermal stability,
which retained 76% of its initial activity after incubating at 50 ◦ C for 6 h. In contrast to other
β-galactosidases, MaBGA displayed strict substrate specificity, not only for the glycosyl group, but
also for the linkage type. To better understand the structure–function relationship, the encoding
gene of MaBGA was obtained and subject to bioinformatics analysis. Multiple alignments and
phylogenetic analysis revealed that MaBGA belonged to the glycoside hydrolase family 42 and had
closer genetic relationships with thermophilic β-galactosidases of extremophiles. With the aid of
homology modeling and molecular docking, we proposed a reasonable explanation for the linkage
selectivity of MaBGA from a structural perspective. On account of the robust stability and 1,3-linkage
selectivity, MaBGA would be a promising candidate in the biosynthesis of galacto-oligosaccharide
with β1–3 linkage.

1. Introduction
The enzyme β-galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23, BGA), which are widely distributed in various
organisms, including animals, plants, bacteria, archaea, yeasts and fungi, are capable of catalyzing the
hydrolysis of molecules containing the β-glycosidic bond, to release their terminal non-reducing
galactose molecules. In some cases, β-galactosidases can catalyze the reverse reaction of the
hydrolysis, transglycosylation, when receptors of galactosyl are monosaccharides, disaccharides
or oligosaccharides, instead of water molecules [1]. Due to the catalytic characteristic, β-galactosidases
are important for the dairy industry to produce milk with low/no lactose for people who suffer from
lactose intolerance [2]. Moreover, β-galactosidases are also widely utilized for enzymatic synthesis
of galacto-oligosaccharides, which can be employed to stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria
selectively in the gut, as prebiotics [3].
Based on the similarity of the amino acid sequences, β-galactosidases are mainly divided into four
glycoside hydrolase (GH) families [4]—GH1, GH2, GH35 and GH42—according to the carbohydrate-active
enzymes database (CAZy) [5]. All of these four families belong to the GH-A superfamily, of which

2.2.4. Effects of Metal Ions and Chemicals on the Activity of MaBGA
As shown in Table 2, K+ , Na+ and Mn2+ displayed no significant effects on the activity of MaBGA,
as well as EDTA. Interestingly, Fe2+ is capable of improving the activity of MaBGA by 111%, whereas
other bivalent cations—Mg2+ , Co2+ , Ni2+ and Zn2+ —slightly inhibited the activity of the enzyme.
Moreover, reducing agents, such as L-cysteine, L-glutathion and dithiotreitol showed no notable effect
on the activity of MaBGA, indicating that no disulfide bond was indispensable to the enzyme.

2.2.5. Substrate Specificity and Steady-State Kinetic Analysis
MaBGA possessed a narrow substrate spectrum, which showed no activity toward p-nitrophenylβ-D-glucopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-β- D -xylopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-β- D -lactopyranoside,
p-nitrophenyl-β- D -glucuronide,
p-nitrophenyl-a-D-galactopyranoside,
p-nitrophenyl-β-Larabinopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-cellobioside.
Moreover, MaBGA showed not only
group selectivity, but also showed linkage selectivity in the substrate recognition process, of which the
activity toward p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside was 4.22-fold greater than that of ONPG (Table 3).

The steady-state kinetic constants of MaBGA were determined by using a nonlinear fitting plot.
The apparent Michaelis–Menten constant Km and the maximum reaction velocity V max were calculated
as 14.19 mM and 1.049 µM·min−1 , respectively.
2.2.6. Linkage Selectivity Analysis
As shown in Figure 3, the chromatograms of Galβ1–4GlcNAc showed no change before and
after the reaction catalyzed by MaBGA, as well as Galβ1–6GlcNAc, suggesting that MaBGA was
unable to hydrolyze both Galβ1–4GlcNAc and Galβ1–6GlcNAc. With regard to Galβ1–3GlcNAc,
the product chromatogram generated a new peak corresponding to the standard of β-galactose,
with an identical retention time of 10.1 min, indicating that MaBGA was capable of degrading
Galβ1–3GlcNAc selectively.

3. Discussion
In the present study, a thermostable β-1,3-galactosidase MaBGA was successfully purified to
homogeneity from Marinomonas sp. BSi20414 isolated from Arctic sea ice by ammonium sulfate
precipitation and anion exchange chromatography, resulting in an 8.12-fold increase in specific activity
and 9.9% recovery in total activity. The purification results showed that the two-step purification
method is efficient for separating MaBGA from the wild-type strain of Marinomonas sp. BSi20414,
which also provides a reference for extracting other proteins from strains belonging to the genus
of Marinomonas.
Interestingly, as an enzyme stemmed from a strain living in permanently low-temperature marine
environments, MaBGA displayed extraordinary stability against heat, with the half-life determined
as 16 h at 50 ◦ C. Phylogenetic analysis of characterized GH42 BGAs also revealed that MaBGA
had closer genetic relationships with thermophilic BGAs derived from extremophiles, including
thermophiles [11–15] and halophiles [16,17]. On account of the enzymatic and phylogenetic analyses,
MaBGA was considered as a thermophilic enzyme, although the thermal stability of MaBGA is weaker
than those of its thermophilic counterparts. Additionally, MaBGA only shared high identity (>70%)
with BGAs of the genus Marinomonas, and no sequence with identity more than 55% was found in
their related marine species. On the basis of the above evidence, a putative explanation was proposed
to illustrate the mismatch of enzyme stability and circumstance. It is supposed that the ancestor of the
genus Marinomonas acquired the gene encoding thermophilic β-galactosidase from other thermophiles
by occasional horizontal transfer, then experienced adaptive evolution under low-temperature marine
environments for a long period, which led to a decrease in thermal stability without selection pressures.
Another point worth mentioning is that MaBGA has a strict substrate specificity, unlike other GH42
BGAs. Furthermore, it displayed not only group selectivity, but also linkage selectivity in the substrate
recognition process. As indicated above, MaBGA was able to hydrolyze Galβ1–3GlcNAc, but was
unable to hydrolyze Galβ1–4GlcNAc and Galβ1–6GlcNAc. To better understand the linkage selectivity
of MaBGA, it is essential to put MaBGA against its structural contexts. Thus, the three-dimensional
structure of MaBGA was constructed and subject to docking analysis after energy minimization by
molecular dynamics. As shown in Figure 7c, for all these three substrates, although the galactosyl group
adopts similar lowest energy conformations, the distance is a bit long for the reaction between the oxygen
atom linking the acetylglucosamine group and the carboxyl group of catalytic residues (Glu142/Glu314).
Therefore, the substrate molecule needs to fine-tune its geometry to shorten the distance mentioned
above by overcoming the energy barrier. However, the planar representation of the interaction of
the enzyme/substrate complex indicated that the strong interaction between the glucosyl group of
Galβ1–4GlcNAc (Figure 7e)/Galβ1–6GlcNAc (Figure 7f) and the enzyme might lead to the failure of
the substrates to adjust their conformation for an optimal fit. Therefore, we proposed that the favored
binding conformation with lowest free binding energy of the substrate is not close enough to the
catalytic residues to let the reaction occur, thus the substrate might be fine-tuning its conformation to
achieve an optimal geometry for the reaction. However, due to the different binding energy between
the glucosyl group and enzyme, Galβ1–4GlcNAc and Galβ1–6GlcNAc cannot readily overcome the
energy barrier, other than Galβ1–3GlcNAc. In general, further experiments, such as enzyme/substrate
complex co-crystallization and site-directed mutagenesis, are still needed to test the hypothesis.
A previous study had proven that galacto-oligosaccharides with β1–3 linkage have a stronger
bifidogenic effect than those with β1–4 and β1–6 linkages [35], indicating that the former would be
more popular as prebiotics than the latter two. Generally, the production of galacto-oligosaccharides
is implemented by the transglycosylation activity of β-galactosidase [36], therefore, the linkage
of galacto-oligosaccharides will depend on the linkage recognition ability of β-galactosidase.
Since β-galactosidases that existed in the nature which are capable of recognizing β1–3 galactoside
linkage are very few, the β-1,3-galactosidase MaBGA studied in the present work not only could
provide a promising candidate for the biosynthesis of galacto-oligosaccharides with β1–3 linkage, but
also would offer a good model for research on the substrate recognition mechanism of β-galactosidase.

4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions
Strain BSi20414, used as the source of β-galactosidase, was isolated from a core sample of sea ice
collected from Canada Basin, Arctic Ocean, and was characterized as Marinomonas in our previous
study [22]. The strain was cultivated in medium (pH 7.0) containing MgCl2 (0.5%, w/v), MgSO4 ·7H2 O
(0.4%, w/v), KCl (0.1%, w/v), CaCl2 (0.06%, w/v), lactose (1.5%, w/v) and Tryptone (0.5%, w/v), on
a shaking incubator at 180 rev·min−1 at 30 ◦ C for 96 h. Escherichia coli DH5α used for gene cloning
was cultivated at 37 ◦ C in Luria–Bertani medium. Plasmid pMD18-T (Takara) was used to conduct TA
cloning for sequencing. All chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade.
4.2. Purification of Wild-Type MaBGA
All purification steps were conducted at 4 ◦ C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000× g
for 10 min. The pellet was washed three times with normal saline and was suspended by pre-cooling
PBS buffer (pH 7.0, 50 mM). The suspension was lysed by sonication (burst of 2 s followed by intervals
of 5 s for 30 min). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 15 min and the
supernatant was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (60%, w/v). The precipitate was collected by
centrifugation at 10,000× g for 10 min, then dissolved and dialyzed using PBS buffer (pH 7.0, 50 mM)
overnight. Subsequently, the protein solution was filtered by cellulose acetate film with pore size of
0.22 µm, and the filtrate was loaded onto an anion exchange column HiTrap DEAE FF, which was
pre-equilibrated with PBS buffer (pH 8.0, 50 mM). The column was first washed with PBS buffer
(pH 8.0, 50 mM) for tenfold resin volumes, then was eluted by PBS buffer (pH 8.0, 50 mM) containing
NaCl with a linear gradient from 0.1 M to 0.6 M. Every eluting peak was collected and measured by
standard activity assay. The protein concentration was assayed by the method of Bradford using BSA
(bovine serum albumin) as a standard [37].
4.3. SDS-PAGE Analysis
The purified MaBGA was analyzed by denaturing discontinuous SDS-PAGE on a 5% stacking gel
and a 10% separating gel as described by Laemmli [38]. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant
Blue R-250. The molecular weight of MaBGA was determined by comparing its electrophoretic mobility
with Protein Molecular Weight Marker (MBI).
4.4. β-galactosidase Activity Assay
The β-galactosidase activity was assayed by measuring the absorbance of ONP (o-nitrophenyl)
at 420 nm in 50 mM PBS buffer (pH 7.0) with 10 mM ONPG as substrate. The ONP concentration
was calculated from the standard curve obtained under the same experimental condition. One unit of
enzyme activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 µmol of
ONP per minute.
4.5. Effect of pH on the Activity and Stability of MaBGA
The optimum pH for MaBGA was determined by measuring the activity in Britton–Robinson
buffer with different pH ranging from 3.0 to 12.0. The pH stability was assayed by measuring the
residual activity after incubating MaBGA in different pH buffers at 37 ◦ C for 1 h.
4.6. Effect of Temperature on the Activity and Stability of MaBGA
To study the effect of temperature on the activity of MaBGA, the enzyme activity was assayed at
different temperatures from 10 to 70 ◦ C with 5 ◦ C intervals at pH 7.0. The thermal stability was determined
by assaying the residual activity after incubating the enzyme at 50 ◦ C for 6 h with 1 h intervals.

Mar. Drugs 2017, 15, 13

11 of 15

4.7. Effect of NaCl on the Activity and Stability of MaBGA
In order to determine the effects of NaCl on the activity of MaBGA, the enzyme activity was
assayed with 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5 M NaCl added individually. The NaCl tolerance of
MaBGA was determined by measuring the residual activity after incubating the enzyme in buffers
containing diverse concentration of NaCl from 0.5 M to 5M at 37 ◦ C for 1 h.
4.8. Effect of Metal Ions and Chemicals on the Activity of MaBGA
To investigate the effects of metal ions and chemicals on the MaBGA activity, 1 mM of KCl,
NaCl, FeCl2 , MnCl2 , MgCl2 , CoCl2 , NiCl2 , ZnCl2 , EDTA and 10 mM of L-cysteine, L-glutathion and
dithiotreitol were added to the reaction system individually, and the activity of MaBGA was then
measured under the standard assay as described above. No chemical was added in the control.
4.9. Substrate Specificity
The substrates’ specificity of MaBGA was measured by the standard assay, except that
ONPG was replaced by p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside,
p-nitrophenyl-β-D-xylopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-β-D-lactopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucuronide,
p-nitrophenyl-a-D-galactopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-β-L-arabinopyranoside, p-nitrophenyl-β-Dcellobioside, respectively.
4.10. Steady-State Kinetic Analysis
For steady-state kinetic analysis, the activity of MaBGA was measured by using various
concentrations of ONPG from 0.1 mM to 19 mM. The kinetic constants of the enzyme were determined
by using a nonlinear fitting of the Michaelis–Menten equation: v = V max ·[S]/(Km + [S]), where [S] and
Km are the concentration and Michaelis constants of ONPG, respectively.
4.11. Linkage Selectivity Analysis
To determine the activity of MaBGA toward different linkage types, Galβ1–3GlcNAc,
Galβ1–4GlcNAc and Galβ1–6GlcNAc were used as substrates, respectively. The reaction products
were filtered by nitrocellulose membrane with pore size of 0.22 µm, in advance of being subject to
detection by HPLC equipped with an Aminex HPX-87P column and differential detector. The column
temperature and flow rate were set as 85 ◦ C and 0.5 mL·min−1 .
4.12. Gene Cloning and Sequence Analysis
The partial sequence of gene mabga was amplified by using degenerate primer pairs F1/R1, F1/R2,
F1/R3, F2/R1, F2/R2, F2/R3, F3/R1, F3/R2, F3/R3, A208/B1, A208/C1, A208/C2, A76/B1, A76/C1,
A76/C2, A195/B1, A195/C1 and A195/C2 (Table 1), respectively, which were designed according to
the conservative regions of the protein sequence of β-galactosidases. PCR was performed as follows:
95 ◦ C for 4 min; followed by 30 cycles of 95 ◦ C for 1 min, 50 ◦ C for 1 min, and 72 ◦ C for 2 min; with
a final extension at 72 ◦ C for 10 min. The amplified fragment was inserted into the pMD18-T vector
and then transformed into E. coli DH5α for sequencing.
The 50 and 30 flanking regions of the known partial sequence were obtained by using DNA
Walking SpeedUp™ Kit of Seegene, which adopted the thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR)
strategy [39]. The nested specific primers for upstream and downstream regions were designed
based on the obtained partial sequence (Table 5). TAIL-PCR was performed as described by the
kit. The amplified fragments were purified and ligated into the pMD18-T vector for sequencing.
The upstream, downstream and obtained partial sequences were assembled to obtain a full-length
mabga gene.

Homologous search in GenBank was performed using the BLAST server (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Alignment of multiple protein sequences was conducted using the Clustal
X 2.0 program [40] and rendered by ESPript [41]. A phylogenetic tree of multiple β-galactosidase
was constructed using the neighbor-joining method [31] in MEGA6 [32], with a bootstrap test of
1000 replicates.
4.13. Homology Modelling and Molecular Docking Analysis
The three-dimensional model of MaBGA was constructed by using MODELLER [27], Robetta [26],
I-TASSER [28] and SWISS-MODEL [25], respectively. Precise evaluation of the model quality was
performed using ProSA-web [29] and PROCHECK [30]. To remove steric clashes, the constructed
model was subject to an energy minimization process in vacuum by using the steepest descent method
for about 5000 iterations in GROMACS 4.5 [33].
The refined model was used for docking with Galβ1–3GlcNAc, Galβ1–4GlcNAc and Galβ1–6GlcNAc,
respectively, using Autodock 4.2 [34] with default parameters. The representation of the protein
structure was achieved using the program PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System,
Version 1.7 Schrödinger, LLC., New York, NY, USA).
5. Conclusions
In this work, a thermostable β-1,3-galactosidase MaBGA derived from Marinomonas sp. BSi20414,
was first purified to homogeneity and characterized extensively. MaBGA displayed robust stability
against heat and strict substrate specificity toward both the glycosyl group and the linkage type.
Although further experiments are required to decipher its substrate recognition mechanism, our study
provided an attractive alternative for biosynthesis of galacto-oligosaccharide with β1–3 linkage and
laid the groundwork for the protein engineering to modify the linkage preference of β-galactosidase.

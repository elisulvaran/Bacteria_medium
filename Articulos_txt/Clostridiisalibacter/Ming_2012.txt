A novel mesophilic, strictly anaerobic bacterium, strain BMT, was isolated from food industry
wastewater. The cells were motile, non-spore-forming rods and stained Gram-negative. Growth
of strain BMT was observed at 16–44 6C (optimum 37 6C) and pH 6.0–9.0 (optimum pH 7.5).
The NaCl concentration range for growth was 0–8 % (optimum 1.5 %, w/v). Strain BMT was
chemo-organotrophic, using a few sugars and amino acids as sole carbon and energy sources.
The fermentation products from peptone-yeast extract broth were propionate, formate, acetate,
ethanol and isovalerate. Indole, NH3 and H2S were produced from peptone. No respiratory
quinones could be detected. The major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 (39.3 %), iso-C15 : 0 dimethyl
acetal (10.1 %), anteiso-C15 : 0 (7.6 %), C14 : 0 (6.1 %) and C16 : 0 (5.6 %). The major polar lipids
were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol and a number of
unidentified aminoglycolipids, glycolipids and phospholipids. The DNA G+C content was
28.2 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain
BMT was related to various genera of the family Clostridiaceae, and its closest relatives were
Sporosalibacterium faouarense SOL3f37T (94.3 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity),
Proteiniborus ethanoligenes GWT (92.1 %) and Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T
(92.0 %). In recognition of its distinct phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, isolate BMT is
proposed to represent a novel species of a new genus, Brassicibacter mesophilus gen. nov., sp.
nov. The type strain of Brassicibacter mesophilus is BMT (5JCM 16868T 5DSM 24659T).

Zhacai is a variety of preserved vegetable that has been
favoured in China since it was originally salted during the
1890s. The tumid stem of Brassica juncea var. tumida is
generally used to make the juicy, salty and slightly sour
pickle. During the salting process, a microbial community
that consists of bacteria, yeasts and fungi plays important
roles in the degradation of protein, cellulose and starch
from the vegetable to form the distinctive flavour.
Industrial manufacture of zhacai was introduced in China
during the 1980s, resulting in an industrial wastewater with
high salinity (2–8 %) and organic load. Microbiological
degradation has proved to be an effective technology to
treat the industrial wastewater. When developing the
technology, the microbiological composition of the wastewater was investigated and several strains with low 16S
rRNA gene sequence similarity to known species were

isolated, such as Citricoccus zhacaiensis FS24T (Meng et al.,
2010). Here, we report a strain representing a novel species
of a new genus belonging to the family Clostridiaceae
within the order Clostridiales (Wiegel, 2009) that is a
strictly anaerobic, mesophilic, non-spore-forming bacterium, isolated from zhacai wastewater.
DSMZ medium 104b was used for isolation and routine
cultivation. The wastewater was serially diluted and
inoculated into Hungate roll-tubes (Hungate, 1969) under
O2-free N2. The tubes were incubated at 37 uC until colonies
were formed. Hungate roll-tube technique was performed
several times to acquire a pure culture of strain BMT.
The cell morphology was examined under optical (Olympus
BX 40) and electron (JEOL JEM-1230) microscopy. Gram
staining was performed in all growth phases. Silver-plating
staining was performed to observe the flagella, which were
also observed under transmission electron microscopy. For
transmission electron microscopy, cells were prepared on
plates incubated at 37 uC in an anaerobic chamber (Bugbox;
Ruskinn) for 48 h. Ultrathin sectioning was performed to
examine the cell ultrastructure. Uranyl acetate was used to
stain the cells.

Cells of strain BMT were long, thin rods (0.3–0.662.0–
6.8 mm) with monotrichous flagella (Fig. S1a, available in
IJSEM Online). Cells appeared singly or in pairs. The cells
stained Gram-negative in all growth phases and the
ultrastructure also revealed a Gram-negative-type cell wall
(Fig. S1b). Spores were not observed during cultivation.
The heat resistance of the cells was determined as reported
by Cayol et al. (2000); the cells could not survive heating to
80 uC for 20 min.
The temperature range for growth was determined using a
water bath maintained at 10–50 uC at 1 uC intervals. To
study the salinity requirement, DSMZ medium 104b was
prepared without NaCl and NaCl was added at 0–10 % (w/
v) at 0.5 % intervals. To examine the pH range for growth,
MES (pH 5.5–6.0), PIPES (pH 6.5–7.0), Tricine (pH 7.5–
8.5), CAPSO (pH 9.0–9.5) or CAPS (pH 10.0–11.5) was
added at 25 mM and the pH was adjusted using sterile
solutions (10 %) of HCl or NaOH. All experiments were
performed in triplicate.
Strain BMT was a strict anaerobe. The optimal temperature
for growth was 37 uC (range 16–44 uC). NaCl was not
necessary for growth; the strain grew in the presence of 0–
8 % NaCl, with optimum growth at 1.5 %. The pH range for
growth was 6.0–9.0 with an optimum at pH 7.5; no growth
was observed at or below pH 5.5 or at or above pH 9.5.
Substrate utilization was tested in a basal medium
containing (l21) 0.3 g KH2PO4, 0.3 g K2HPO4, 1.0 g
NH4Cl, 15 g NaCl, 0.1 g KCl, 0.1 g CaCl2 . 2H2O, 0.1 g
MgCl2 . 6H2O and 1 ml 0.1 % (w/v) resazurin. The
medium was adjusted to pH 7.5. Sugars (20 mM), alcohols
(0.1 %), organic acids and amino acids (20 mM) were
added individually to the basal medium in the presence of
0.1 g yeast extract l21. Growth on Casamino acids,
peptone, tryptone and yeast extract (all from BD) was also
examined. Utilization of substrates was confirmed by
analysing fermentation products using HPLC with an ion
exclusion column (Aminex hpx-87h; Bio-Rad). To determine potential electron acceptors, elemental sulfur (0.1 %,
w/v), sulfate (20 mM), thiosulfate (20 mM), nitrate
(10 mM) and nitrite (5 mM) were added to the basal
medium lacking the reductant Na2S, and the results were
analysed as described by Ogg & Patel (2009). The methyl
red and Voges–Proskauer reactions, H2S and indole
production and catalase and oxidase activities were
determined as described by Wu et al. (2010a).
Strain BMT grew heterotrophically on yeast extract, peptone,
tryptone and Casamino acids. The fermentation products in
peptone-yeast extract broth were propionate, formate,
acetate, ethanol and isovalerate. Strain BMT could use four
amino acids (glutamic acid, glycine, methionine and valine)
as sole carbon and energy sources, and formed formate,
acetate and ethanol. Fructose, glucose, ribose, sucrose and
pyruvate were also used, with acetate and ethanol produced.
The following substrates were not used: alanine, arginine,
asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine,
http://ijs.sgmjournals.org

tryptophan, tyrosine, arabinose, cellobiose, galactose, lactose,
maltose, mannose, melibiose, raffinose, rhamnose, salicin,
sorbose, starch, trehalose, xylose, inositol, mannitol, sorbitol,
methanol, ethanol, propanol, citrate, fumarate, malate,
succinate, malonate, formate, acetate, propionate, lactate,
cellulose and xylan. Although tryptophan was not used as a
sole carbon source, indole was produced from peptone.
Elemental sulfur and sulfate could enhance growth, but not
thiosulfate, nitrate or nitrite; however, neither sulfur nor
sulfate was reduced to sulfide.
Chemotaxonomic analyses were performed on strain BMT
and Sporosalibacterium faouarense JCM 15487T. Cells used in
analyses of the two strains were cultivated in DSMZ medium
104b until the OD600 reached 0.2, which was considered to
be an indication of late-exponential phase. Fatty acid methyl
esters (FAMEs) were obtained from freeze-dried cells as
described by Kuykendall et al. (1988). Identification and
quantification of the FAMEs were performed automatically
by using the Sherlock Microbial Identification System with
the standard MIS Library Generation Software (Microbial
ID Inc.). The main FAMEs of strain BMT were iso-C15 : 0
(39.3 %), iso-C15 : 0 dimethyl acetal (DMA) (10.1 %), anteiso-C15 : 0 (7.6 %), C14 : 0 (6.1 %) and C16 : 0 (5.6 %). The fatty
acid profiles of the two strains are shown in Table 1.
Although the main fatty acids of the two strains were similar,
differences were observed in their proportions and also in
the minor components observed. Isoprenoid quinones were
extracted according to Minnikin et al. (1984) and analysed
by HPLC as described by Tindall (1990). No quinone was
detected from either strain. The polar lipids were extracted
and separated on silica gel plates (10610 cm; Merck 5554)
and analysed further as described by Minnikin et al. (1984)
and Xu et al. (2007). Molybdatophosphoric acid was used to
reveal total lipids, Zinzadze’s reagent for phospholipids,
ninhydrin for aminolipids and a-naphthol for glycolipids.
The polar lipid composition of strain BMT was distinguishable from that of S. faouarense JCM 15487T (Fig. S2).
Genomic DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA gene was
amplified as described by Wu et al. (2010b). The almostcomplete 16S rRNA sequence (1490 nt) was compared with
sequences from closely related species with the EzTaxon
service (Chun et al., 2007). Sequence data were aligned with
CLUSTAL W version 1.8 (Thompson et al., 1994). Neighbourjoining (Saitou & Nei, 1987), maximum-parsimony (Fitch,
1971) and maximum-likelihood (Felsenstein, 1981) methods in MEGA 5 (Tamura et al., 2011) were used to reconstruct
the phylogenetic tree. Evolutionary distances were calculated
according to the algorithm of Kimura’s two-parameter
model (Kimura, 1980) for the neighbour-joining tree (Fig.
1). Its topology was also supported by the maximumparsimony and maximum-likelihood trees (see Figs S3 and
S4). The DNA G+C content of strain BMT, determined by
reverse-phase HPLC according to Mesbah & Whitman
(1989), was 28.2 mol%.
On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, the
three closest relatives of strain BMT were S. faouarense

to two thermophilic strains, Thermohalobacter berrensis
CTT3T (91.3 % pairwise similarity) and Caloranaerobacter
azorensis MV1087T (91.1 %). Comparisons of 16S rRNA
gene sequences revealed that strain BMT belonged to
cluster XII of the Clostridiales (Collins et al., 1994).
According to the latest edition of Bergey’s Manual of
Systematic Bacteriology (Wiegel, 2009), strain BMT should
be classified into the family Clostridiaceae within the order
Clostridiales, and probably represents a novel species of a
new genus.
Genotypic and phenotypic traits suggest that strain BMT is
distinct from its phylogenetic relatives (Table 2). Strain BMT
differed from T. berrensis CTT3T (Cayol et al., 2000) and
Caloranaerobacter azorensis MV1087T (Wery et al., 2001) in
that the latter strains are thermophilic (and hence were not
included in Table 2), with optimal growth temperatures of
65 uC, whereas the upper temperature for growth of strain
BMT was 44 uC. Strain BMT fermented amino acids and
sugars, which were not metabolized by P. ethanoligenes GWT
(Niu et al., 2008), and the G+C content of P. ethanoligenes
GWT (38.0 mol%) was significantly higher than that of
strain BMT. In contrast to Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans
37HS60T (Liebgott et al., 2008), strain BMT could use four
sugars as sole carbon and energy sources, and was able to use
glutamic acid, glycine, methionine and valine, while
Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T fermented cysteine,
lysine, serine and valine.
Finally, chemotaxonomic evidence showed the distant
relatedness between strain BMT and S. faouarense JCM
15487T. Strain BMT had a lower content (10.1 %) of isoC15 : 0 DMA than did S. faouarense JCM 15487T (22.5 %),
and also possessed C14 : 0 and C16 : 0 as major components,
while these two fatty acids were minor components in S.
faouarense JCM 15487T (Table 1). Moreover, nonadecanoic
acids (C19 : 0, anteiso-C19 : 0) and eicosaenoic acids (C20 : 0,
C20 : 1 cis11, C20 : 1 cis13/trans11) were present in extracts of

BMT possessed diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol as major phospholipids; however, in S. faouarense JCM 15487T, there was
little phosphatidylethanolamine, and the glycolipids were
also different in the two strains (Fig. S2). Other differences
between strain BMT and S. faouarense JCM 15487T (Rezgui

spore formation, dependence on yeast extract and NaCl,
tolerance of NaCl and substrates used.

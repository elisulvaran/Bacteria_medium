A novel, obligately chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing bacterial strain, designated strain
gps52T, was isolated from a rock sample collected near the hydrothermal vents of the Suiyo
Seamount in the Pacific Ocean. The cells possessed a Gram-stain-negative-type cell wall and
contained menaquinone-8(H4) and menaquinone-9(H4) as respiratory quinones, and C16 : 1v7c,
C16 : 0 and C18 : 1v7c as major cellular fatty acids. Neither storage compounds nor extensive
internal membranes were observed in the cells. Strain gps52T grew using carbon dioxide fixation
and oxidation of inorganic sulfur compounds with oxygen as electron acceptor. Optimal growth
was observed at 32 6C, pH 6.5 and with 3 % (w/v) NaCl. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S
rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain gps52T belongs to the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae
and is different from any other known bacteria, with sequence similarities of less than 93 %. Based
on phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, the isolate is considered to represent a novel genus and
species in the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae, and the name Thiogranum longum gen. nov., sp.
nov. is proposed. The type strain is gps52T (5NBRC 101260T5DSM 19610T). An emended
description of the genus Thiohalomonas is also proposed.

Hydrothermal vents have been discovered in the ocean
floor all over the world. These environments are home to
unique ecosystems that include chemolithoautotrophs as
primary producers, and sulfur-oxidizing prokaryotes often
play a major role in the oxidation of sulfide from
hydrothermal vents by using oxygen from the upper layer
of the sea. Various kinds of chemolithoautotrophic, sulfuroxidizing prokaryotes have been detected using culturedependent or -independent analyses, and they have been
shown to encompass phylogenetically diverse prokaryotes.
Some mesophilic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria have been
isolated from such environments, mainly belonging to
the classes Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria.
The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene
sequence of strain gps52T is AB983478.
Three supplementary figures are available with the online Supplementary Material.

Takai et al. (2003) first reported that various kinds of
sulfur-oxidizing epsilonproteobacteria inhabit hydrothermal vents, and many novel sulfur-oxidizing epsilonproteobacteria have subsequently been isolated from these
environments (Inagaki et al., 2003, 2004; Takai et al.,
2004). Several sulfur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the
class Gammaproteobacteria have also been detected in such
environments (Dubilier et al., 2008; Hirayama et al., 2007;
Nunoura et al., 2012; Sunamura et al., 2004) and they have
actually been isolated (Brinkhoff et al., 1999; Mori et al.,
2011; Sievert et al., 2000; Takai et al., 2006).
The order Chromatiales of the class Gammaproteobacteria
contains five families – Chromatiaceae, Ectothiorhodospiraceae, Halothiobacillaceae, Granulosicoccaceae and
Thioalkalispiraceae. The family Chromatiaceae consists of
anaerobic phototrophic bacteria known as phototrophic
purple sulfur bacteria (Imhoff, 2005a). The families Halothiobacillaceae and Thioalkalispiraceae are mainly composed

of strictly chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria
(Ito et al., 2005; Kelly & Wood, 2005; Mori & Suzuki, 2008;
Mori et al., 2011), and members of the genus Granulosicoccus, the only genus in the family Granulosicoccaceae,
grow chemoheterotrophically (Lee et al., 2007). By contrast,
members of the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae show different
types of metabolisms, e.g. photolithotrophic, photoheterotrophic, chemoheterotrophic, methylotrophic and chemolithotrophic using nitrite, sulfur compounds, arsenite and
iron as inorganic electron donors (Hallberg et al., 2011;
Hoeft et al., 2007; Imhoff, 2005b; Sorokin et al., 2007b).
Although strains of the order Chromatiales have been
isolated from various environments such as lakes, ponds,
rivers, hot springs, estuaries, marine habitats, salt lakes and
soda lakes, all isolates from hydrothermal fields belonging to
this order are sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Durand et al., 1993;
Mori et al., 2011; Sievert et al., 2000; Takai et al., 2009).
A submarine caldera of Suiyo Seamount in the Pacific Ocean
has numerous black smoker hydrothermal vents (Glasby
et al., 2000), and sulfur-compound-utilizing prokaryotes
have been observed and isolated there (Mori et al., 2004,
2008, 2011; Nakagawa et al., 2004; Sunamura et al., 2004).
Recently, an obligately chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing bacterium was isolated from the seamount, and
phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences suggested
that the isolate represents a novel genus and species in the
family Ectothiorhodospiraceae. In this paper, based on
phenotypic characteristics as well as phylogenetic analysis,
a novel taxon is proposed to accommodate the isolate –
Thiogranum longum gen. nov., sp. nov.
Strain gps52T was isolated from a rock sample collected from
a deep-sea hydrothermal field on the Suiyo Seamount.
Details of the sample collection, enrichment procedures, and
composition of the media used for enrichment and isolation
have been described previously (Mori et al., 2011). AP8SO1
medium includes 5 mM thiosulfate in a basal medium
under an atmosphere of N2/CO2/O2 (75 : 20 : 5, by vol.; 150
kPa), and AP8SO2 medium is modified AP8SO1 medium
supplemented with 20 mM thiosulfate under an atmosphere
of N2/CO2/O2 (60 : 20 : 20, by vol.; 150 kPa). After 1 week of
incubation of the rock core sample in AO8SO1 medium at
30 uC, microbial growth was observed. Because better
growth was observed in AP8SO2 than in AP8SO1 medium,
AP8SO2 medium was subsequently used for isolation.
Because growth of the enriched bacteria could not be
achieved successfully on solid AP8SO2 medium, an attempt
was made to isolate bacteria by serial dilution. After
repeating the maximum dilution series several times, a
sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, designated strain gps52T, was
obtained. The purity of the isolate was verified by
microscopic observation, inoculation into media containing
various heterotrophic substrates and determination of the
16S rRNA gene sequence, which was amplified using various
primer sets (Mori & Suzuki, 2008).
Cells of strain gps52T were short rods but sometimes
elongated without septa at the late exponential phase of
236

growth (0.7–3.0 mm in length and 0.3–0.4 mm in width)
(Fig. 1a, b). Motility was not observed under a microscope.
No flagellum was observed on cells negatively stained with
1 % (w/v) phosphotungstic acid (data not shown).
Observation of ultrathin sections of cells using an electron
microscope (Mori & Suzuki, 2008) indicated that they
possessed a Gram-negative type of cell wall with an outer
membrane and contained neither storage compounds nor
extensive internal membranes (Fig. 1c). The cells were also
shown to be Gram-stain-negative using both conventional
Gram staining and the 3 % (w/v) KOH string test (Powers,
1995). Catalase (Holding & Collee, 1971) and oxidase
(cytochrome oxidase paper; Nissui Pharmaceutical) activities were negative and positive, respectively.
Fatty acid methyl ester analysis was performed using the
GC/MS method (Hanada et al., 2002) and the MIDI
microbial identification system. The major cellular fatty
acids of strain gps52T were C16 : 1v7c (63 % of total fatty
acids), C16 : 0 (26 %) and C18 : 1v7c (10 %). The strain also
contained C14 : 0 (3 %), C15 : 0 (1 %) and C17 : 1v8c (1 %) as
minor fatty acid components. Respiratory quinones were
extracted from cells according to the protocol of Nakagawa
& Yamasato (1993) and analysed with an LCMS-QP
800alpha spectrometer (Shimadzu). Strain gps52T contained equivalent amounts of menaquinone-8(H4) and
menaquinone-9(H4). The G+C content of the genomic
DNA was determined by HPLC using a Shodex ODS pack
F-411 (Showa Denko) after nuclease P1 treatment using
a DNA-GC kit (Yamasa Shoyu) followed by alkaline
phosphatase treatment (Kamagata & Mikami, 1991). The
equimolar nucleotide mixture in the DNA-GC kit was used
as a reference for quantitative analysis. The G+C content
in the genomic DNA of strain gps52T was 53.8 mol%.
Utilization of electron donors and acceptors was comprehensively determined by measuring the OD660 (spectrophotometer U-2800; Hitachi), thiosulfate and sulfate
concentrations by using HPLC (Mori et al., 2008) and cell
increase via microscopic observation. In medium under an
N2/CO2/O2 atmosphere, strain gps52T oxidized thiosulfate
(20 mM), sulfite (5 and 10 mM), elemental sulfur (5 %),
sulfide (2 and 5 mM) and tetrathionate (5 and 10 mM) as
electron donors. The following substrates (mM) could
not support growth of strain gps52T: H2 [H2/CO2/O2,
60 : 20 : 20 (v/v), 150 kPa], H2+acetate (10), CH4 [N2/CO2/
O2/CH4, 50 : 20 : 20 : 10 (v/v), 150 kPa], methanol (2 and 5),
formate (10 and 30), acetate (10 and 30), butyrate (10),
citrate (10), fumarate (10), glutamate (10), lactate (10),
malate (10), pyruvate (10), succinate (10), L-arginine (10),
L-asparagine (10), L-cysteine (10), L-histidine (10), Lleucine (10), L-methionine (10), arabinose (5), fructose
(5), galactose (5), glucose (5), inositol (5), mannose (5),
raffinose (5), sucrose (5) or xylose (5). In the presence of
thiosulfate or sulfur as an electron donor, oxygen was the
only usable electron acceptor for growth of strain gps52T,
and the following electron acceptors (mM) could not be
used: nitrate (10), nitrite (2.5 and 5), fumarate (10), iron
(III) hydroxide (5), iron (III) citrate (5) (Heising et al.,

1999), manganese (5), selenate (2.5 and 5), selenite (2.5
and 5) or arsenate (2.5 and 5). In the presence of
thiosulfate under an atmosphere of N2/CO2 [80 : 20 (v/v),
150 kPa], exposure to light from a halogen lamp induced
neither growth, nor decrease of thiosulfate, nor increase of
sulfate, indicating that strain gps52T was not capable of
anoxygenic photosynthesis. Therefore, strain gps52T is an
obligate chemolithoautotroph that grows by sulfur oxidation and carbon dioxide fixation.
Temperature, initial pH, and NaCl concentration ranges
for growth were determined by examining the time-course
of OD660 with a temperature gradient incubator (model
TN-2612; ADOVANTEC). The pH of the AP8SO2 medium
was adjusted by the addition of 10 % (w/v) Na2CO3 or
0.2 M HCl. The results are shown in Fig. S1 (available in
the online Supplementary Material). Strain gps52T grew at
19–35 uC, and the optimum temperature for growth was
32 uC. The initial pH range for growth was pH 6.0–7.5,
with an optimum of pH 6.5. The strain grew with 2–4 %
(w/v) NaCl, with an optimum concentration of 3 % NaCl.
At NaCl concentrations of 1 and 5 %, faint growth with
increases in sulfate and decreases in thiosulfate were also
observed. The specific growth rate under the optimum
growth conditions was 0.064 h21.
An almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence for strain
gps52T was determined using a previously reported
procedure (Hattori et al., 2000). After sequence alignment
using the ARB program (Ludwig et al., 2004), phylogenetic
trees were reconstructed using three methods: neighbourjoining using CLUSTAL X version 2.1 (Larkin et al., 2007),
maximum-likelihood using the NucML program in
MOLPHY (Adachi & Hasegawa, 1995; Hasegawa et al.,
1985; Mori et al., 2003) and maximum-parsimony using
MEGA version 6.06 (Tamura et al., 2013), using the treebisection-reconnection (TBR) search method. The phylogenetic analyses indicated that strain gps52T is a member of
the order Chromatiales in the class Gammaproteobacteria.
http://ijs.sgmjournals.org

However, the sequence of strain gps52T was distant from
those of all known genera in the order, and the closest
relatives were Natronocella acetinitrilica and Methylonatrum kenyense in the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae, with
sequence similarities of 92.7 and 92.6 %, respectively. The
sequence similarities between strain gps52T and species in
the order with validly published names were 87.9–92.7 %
for the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae, 90.5–92.3 % for the
family Thioalkalispiraceae, 90.4–90.9 % for the family
Granulosicoccaceae, 86.6–90.2 % for the family Chromatiaceae and 85.6–89.4 % for the family Halothiobacillaceae.
Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed, based on 16S rRNA
gene sequences for strain gps52T, type strains in the order
Chromatiales, excluding members of the genera Nitrosococcus and Rheinheimera (Mori et al., 2011), and the
type strains of species of the genus Thiohalomonas, an
unclassified gammaproteobacterial genus (Sorokin et al.,
2007a). The tree reconstructed using the neighbour-joining
method (Fig. 2) indicated that strain gps52T is a member of
the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae, but the nodes for the
clusters including members of the families Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Thioalkalispiraceae were ambiguous with
low bootstrap scores. The tree reconstructed using the
maximum-likelihood method (Fig. S2) was similar to
that reconstructed using the neighbour-joining method.
However, the tree reconstructed using the maximumparsimony method (Fig. S3) indicated that the family
Ectothiorhodospiraceae contains two distinct lineages, that
the families Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Thioalkalispiraceae
lack unity, and that the phylogenetic position of strain gps52T
is close to that of the genus Thioprofundum. Phylogenetic
trees reconstructed using all methods showed that species in
the genus Thiohalomonas belong to the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae (Figs 2, S2 and S3) and that the closest relative of
the type strains of species of this genus is Thioalbus
denitrificans, with a sequence similarity of 94.1–94.4 %.
The genus Thiohalomonas accommodates moderately halophilic, obligately chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing

bacteria that belongs to the class Gammaproteobacteria
(Sorokin et al., 2007a). Sorokin et al. proposed the genus but
did not propose a family to which it belongs. The results of
our phylogenetic analyses using 16S rRNA gene sequences
make it clear that the genus Thiohalomonas belongs to the
family Ectothiorhodospiraceae.
An obligately chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, named strain gps52T, was isolated from a hydrothermal field in the Suiyo Seamount. Phylogenetic analyses
based on 16S rRNA gene sequences using the neighbourjoining and maximum-likelihood methods indicated that
the isolate belongs to the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae,
although the bootstrap values at the nodes of the cluster
Ectothiorhodospiraceae were low and the topology inferred
using the maximum-parsimony method differed from that
inferred using the other methods (Figs 2, S2 and S3).
Although the possibility that strain gps52T is affiliated with
another family cannot be completely eliminated, at this
point it seems reasonable to conclude that strain gps52T
belongs to the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae. The genera
238

Thioalbus, Thioalkalivibrio, Thiohalomonas and Thiohalospira, also belonging to the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae, are
chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Banciu
et al., 2004; Imhoff, 2005b; Park et al., 2011; Sorokin et al.,
2002a, b, 2003, 2004, 2007a, 2008, 2012), but strain gps52T
clearly differs from them in the following characteristics
(Table 1). The G+C content of the genomic DNA
differentiates strain gps52T from members of these four
genera. Species in the genus Thioalkalivibrio are alkaliphilic,
whereas strain gps52T was found to be neutrophilic. The
members of the genera Thiohalomonas and Thiohalospira
prefer extremely halophilic conditions for growth, but strain
gps52T grew optimally at 3 % (w/v) NaCl. Given the unique
phenotypic features of strain gps52T, and considering its
solitary lineage in the phylogenetic trees and its low sequence
similarities with species of the order Chromatiales, it is clear
that this novel strain cannot be assigned to any previously
recognized genera. On the basis of physiological and
phylogenetic findings, a novel taxon, Thiogranum longum
gen. nov., sp. nov., belonging to the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae, is proposed.

The order Chromatiales contains five families and includes
various types of bacteria such as phototrophs, chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs. The family Granulosicoccaceae
in the order Chromatiales contains one genus, Granulosicoccus,
and it is an obligately chemoheterotrophic bacterium
(Kurilenko et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2007). Mori et al. (2011)
proposed a fifth family, Thioalkalispiraceae, in the order
Chromatiales while the members of the family Granulosicoccaceae were not included in their phylogenetic
analysis. Subsequently, two other genera, Acidiferrobacter
and Thioalbus, were added to the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae, but the phylogenetic analyses did not consider
the family Granulosicoccaceae (Hallberg et al., 2011; Park
et al., 2011). This study is the first taxonomic analysis of all
the species of the order Chromatiales with validly published
names. In our phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA
gene sequences, the boundaries of the families Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Thioalkalispiraceae were obscure, and
the families could not be regarded as independent lineages.
This is likely to arise from the deep branching of some genera
of the families Ectothiorhodospiraceae, Thioalkalispiraceae and
Granulosicoccaceae in the order Chromatiales. At this point, it
is difficult to clearly divide these deep-branching genera,
such as Thioprofundum, Granulosicoccus, Acidiferrobacter,
Methylohalomonas, Natronocella, Methylonatrum, Thioalbus
and our proposed genus. More isolates will be required to
fully clarify the relationships among the families in the order
Chromatiales.

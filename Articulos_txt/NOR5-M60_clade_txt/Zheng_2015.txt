Abstract
Background: Aerobic anoxygenic photototrophic (AAP) bacteria represent an important group of marine microorganisms
inhabiting the euphotic zone of the ocean. They harvest light using bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a and are thought to be
important players in carbon cycling in the ocean.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria represent an important part of marine
microbial communities. Their photosynthetic apparatus is encoded by a number of genes organized in a so-called
photosynthetic gene cluster (PGC). In this study, the organization of PGCs was analyzed in ten AAP species belonging to the
orders Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales and the NOR5/OM60 clade. Sphingomonadales contained comparatively smaller
PGCs with an approximately size of 39 kb whereas the average size of PGCs in Rhodobacterales and NOR5/OM60 clade was
about 45 kb. The distribution of four arrangements, based on the permutation and combination of the two conserved
regions bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puhABC and crtF-bchCXYZ, does not correspond to the phylogenetic affiliation of individual AAP
bacterial species. While PGCs of all analyzed species contained the same set of genes for bacteriochlorophyll synthesis and
assembly of photosynthetic centers, they differed largely in the carotenoid biosynthetic genes. Spheroidenone,
spirilloxanthin, and zeaxanthin biosynthetic pathways were found in each clade respectively. All of the carotenoid
biosynthetic genes were found in the PGCs of Rhodobacterales, however Sphingomonadales and NOR5/OM60 strains
contained some of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway genes outside of the PGC.
Conclusions/Significance: Our investigations shed light on the evolution and functional implications in PGCs of marine
aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs, and support the notion that AAP are a heterogenous physiological group phylogenetically
scattered among Proteobacteria.

Compared to the oxygenic phototrophs, the anoxygenic species
contain a relatively simple photosynthetic apparatus, which
consists of a reaction center surrounded by one to three types of
antenna complexes [12]. Both aerobic and anaerobic anoxygenic
phototrophs have most of the photosynthetic genes organized in a
so-called photosynthesis gene cluster (PGC) [13]. The PGC
contains genes for the photosynthetic reaction center, light
harvesting complexes, BChl and carotenoid biosynthesis, as well
as some regulatory factors. Despite the fact that the basic set of
genes in PGC is conserved, the gene organization of operons in
PGC largely varies among different AAP bacterial lineages. Two
conserved subclusters, crt-bchCXYZ-puf (about 10 kb) and
bchFNBHLM-IhaA-puh (about 12–15 kb) were identified in PGCs
of different phototrophic Proteobacteria [14–16]. The orientation of
the genes in each subcluster was the same, although the gene order
could vary slightly (e.g. pufBA and pufLM). Interestingly, the

Introduction
Aerobic anoxygenic photototrophic (AAP) bacteria represent an
important group of marine microorganisms inhabiting the
euphotic zone of the ocean. They harvest light using bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a and various carotenoids serving as auxiliary
pigments. These phototrophic microorganisms are thought to be
important players in oceanic carbon cycling [1–3]. Cultureindependent studies have shown that marine AAP bacterial
communities are mostly represented by Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria [4,5]. Most cultured marine Alphaproteobacterial AAPs belong
to Roseobacter clade and the order Sphingomonadales, which includes
members of the genera Erythrobacter and Citromicrobium [6–8]. AAP
bacterial isolates related to Gammaproteobacteria belong to the clade
NOR5/OM60 which contains Congregibacter litoralis KT71 [9,10]
and strain HTCC2080 [11].

as various gene orders of puf genes, were observed [5,15–17].
Further investigation indicated that such gene organization is
crucial for environmental adaptation [14].

regulatory elements such as the transcriptional regulator ppsR gene
were conserved as well, suggesting that the operons in the PGCs
are co-expressed. The organization of puf (photosynthetic unit
forming, approximately 3 kb) operon varies among different AAP

(Table 1). The GC content in the PGCs varied from 52.9% to
66.7%, which was similar to the total GC contents of
corresponding genomes (Table 1). This may indicate that PGCs
possibly evolve with their genomes long enough to keep
homogenous genomic characteristics. The fact that the PGC is a
stable part of the phototrophs genome is also indicated also by the
fact that the phylogenetic trees constructed for 16S rRNA, pufM
gene and concatenated PGC core genes show basically the same
topology (Fig. 1 and Fig. S2).

Despite its diversity, complexity and functional importance for
AAP bacteria, a detailed investigation of the gene and operon
arrangement of PGC has not been performed in their entirety. In
this study, we analyzed the structure and arrangement of PGC in
the AAP bacterial genomes available to date, with the aim of
addressing the frequency of homologous gene recombination as
well as the differences in carotenoid gene composition and
biosynthetic pathways.

Results and Discussion

The structure and arrangement of PGC

Ten fully sequenced AAP species were analyzed for their
photosynthetic genes and PGC composition. According to
phylogenetic analysis using both 16S rRNA and pufM genes, the
ten strains were classified into three main groups: Roseobacter clade
(order Rhodobacterales), Erythrobacter-Citromicrobium clade (order
Sphingomonadales) and NOR5/OM60 clade (Gammaproteobacteria)
(Fig. 1). Roseobacter clade contained six strains belonging to five
genera: Roseobacter (Rsb.) denitrificans OCh 114 [18] and Rsb. litoralis
Och 149 [19], Loktanella vestfoldensis SKA53, Dinoroseobacter shibae
DFL12 [20], Jannaschia sp. CCS1, and Roseovarius sp. 217 [21].
Two species belonged to the order Shingomonadales: Erythrobacter sp.
NAP1 [7] and Citromicrobium sp. JL354 [22]. Two species were
members of Gammaproteobacteria: Congregibacter (Cb.) litoralis KT71
[9,10] and marine Gammaproteobacterium HTCC2080 [11]. The
genome size varied from approximately 3,064 kb (L. vestfoldensis) to
4,763 kb (Roseovarius sp. 217). The PGCs represented roughly 1%
of the genomes (Table 1). Sphingomonadales contained comparatively
smaller PGCs (,39 kb) whereas the average size of PGCs in
Rhodobacterales and NOR5/OM60 clades was about 45 kb

The PGCs have a mosaic structure and consist of five main sets
of genes: bch genes encoding enzymes of BChla biosynthetic
pathways, puf operons encoding proteins forming the reaction
centers, puh operons involved in the RC assembly, crt genes
responsible for biosynthesis of carotenoids and various regulatory
genes. A core set of 27 genes were identified, which were present in
all analyzed PGCs (Fig. S1). Most of them came from the BChl a
biosynthetic pathway. The genes bchBCDFGHILMNOPXYZ and
ascF, with exception of 8-vinyl reductase, represent the complete
biosynthetic pathway from protoporphyrin XI to BChl a. In
contrast, there are only two genes involved in carotenoid synthesis
which are common for all PGCs. Other shared core genes encode
proteins pufABLM and assembly factors puhABCE and lhaA of the
bacterial photosynthetic units.
More complete PGC structures are observed in AAP of
Roseobacter clade compared to Sphingomonadales or NOR5/
OM60 clades. The majority of Roseobacter-related species contained
all the puf genes organized in pufQBALMC operon, which is
involved in the assembly of the photosynthetic units. The only

Diverse Arrangement of Photosynthetic Gene Cluster

The structure of puhABC-hyp-ascF-puhE is conserved in Roseobacter
and Sphingomonadales clades. However in NOR5/OM60 clade,
puhABC and puhE are located together and ascF is at a site near
BLUF. LhaA, encoding a possible LHI assembly protein [28],
occupies the upstream region of puh genes. In downstream puh
genes, there are hemN (NOR5/OM60 clade) or hemA (Roseobacter
and Sphingomonadales clade) [29,30].

exception was L. vestfoldensis SKA53, in which some photosynthetic
genes are located outside the PGC and spread throughout the
genome. Previously it was reported that the PGC in Rsb. litoralis
Och 149 is located on a linear plasmid, with two RPA genes
between bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puh and crtF-bchCXYZ-puf, which act as
a centromere-like anchor when plasmids replicate [19,23].
The PGC organization in Erythrobacter sp. NAP1 and Citromicrobium sp. JL354 (order Sphingomonadales) is almost identical in terms
of gene arrangement and composition. When compared to
Roseobacters, this group contains less carotenoid genes and no
light-harvesting 2 (LH2) genes. The presence of a smaller number
of photosynthetic genes in Sphingomonadales is consistent with the
smaller size of their PGCs (Table 1).
Similarly, PGCs of two NOR5/OM60 strains have very
comparable gene composition and organization. It contains less
transcriptional regulators compared to the other groups. Conversely, a BLUF (blue light using flavin adenine dinucleotide
sensors) was usually observed in upstream regions of PGCs of
NOR5/OM60 clade [9].
Two conserved gene arrangements are found in all analyzed
PGCs: bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puhABC and crtF-bchCXYZ (Fig. 2). According to their direction and order, the ten PGCs can be divided
into three groups: Type I (forward bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puh plus
forward crtF-bchCXYZ-puf) includes Rsb. denitrificans OCh 114 and
Rsb. litoralis Och 149. Cb. litoralis KT71, Gammaproteobacterium
HTCC2080 and Roseovarius sp. 217 belong to type II (forward
bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puh plus reverse crtF-bchCXYZ-puf), and the last
five organisms form type III (forward crtF-bchCXYZ-puf plus forward
bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puh). The last possible arrangement (type IV,
reverse bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puh plus forward crtF-bchCXYZ-puf) has
not been yet found in AAP (or AAP candidates) bacterial genomes
(Fig. S1), however it is present in the purple non-sulfur anaerobic
bacteria Rba. sphaeroides and Rba. capsulatus (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2). The
distribution of PGC types does not correspond to their phylogenetic
affiliation. For example, the Roseobacter clade shows all three PGC
arrangement types observed in AAP genomes. This suggests that
complex operon recombination in PGC occurred after phylogenetic
divergence of AAP bacterial genera.
There are four conserved regions in PGCs for BChl a expressing
of AAP bacteria: bchFNBHLM, bchCXYZ, bchIDO and bchOP. Gene
bchEJ, which exists in most Rhodobacter, was found in Cb. litoralis
KT71 (Fig. 2). There are carotenoid genes between bchCXYZ and
bchIDO, except in D. shibae DLF 12 and Jannaschia sp. CCS1. The
region between bchOP and bchFNBHLM is of variable sequences in
different AAP bacteria clades. In Roseobacter clade and Sphingomonadales, there are two regulators (ppsR and ppaA) which are sensitive
to light intensity and oxygen concentration [24]. In NOR5/OM60
clade, a crtJ gene was found, which controls aerobic repression of
BChl, carotenoid, and LH2 gene expression [25,26].
Four structural types of puf gene organization were observed in
the ten PGCs: pufQBALMC, pufQBALM, pufBALM and pufLMCBA.
Unlike the purple non-sulfur species Rba. sphaeroides and Rba.
capsulatus, all the AAP strains studied lack the pufX gene in the
PGC. The pufQ gene, is absent in the puf operon of NOR5/OM60
and Sphingomonadales clades. In addition, Sphingomonadales and L.
vestfoldensis SKA53 do not have a pufC gene. The gene encoding 1deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) is always located
downstream of puf genes in the Roseobacter clade. DXPS is part of a
mevalonate-independent pathway for isopentenylpyrophosphate
(iPP) biosynthesis, a precursor for carotenoid and bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis [27]. Interestingly, a switch of order in the puf
gene cluster is observed in NOR5/OM60 clade (pufLMC-BA)
compared to the other two AAP clades (pufBA-LMC).

The composition and organization of carotenoid genes
in PGC
The main difference among analyzed PGCs was found in the
genes encoding the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. The
standard set of crt genes identified in Rba. capsulatus contains
crtAIBKCDEFJ (Table 2). A slightly reduced set of genes
(crtAIBCDEF) was also found in some Roseobacter species (Table 2).
However, the organization of the crt operon in Roseobacter clade is
most variable among PGCs (Fig. 2). The almost complete structure
crtAIBK-hyp-crtCDEF is present in the genera Roseobacter and
Dinoroseobacter (Fig. 2), while in D. shibae, crtA and crtIBK are
separated. Homologous recombination occurred between crtAIB

and crtCDEF in Jannaschia sp. CCS1. Comparably, crtICDEF and
crtCDF are missing in NOR5/OM60 clade and order Sphingomonadales, respectively. The re-arrangement of crt genes may result from
events of gene duplication and loss, accounting for the absence of
crtA gene in Sphingomonadales and NOR5 clade (Table 2), and
duplication of some of the crt genes, such as the crtE and crtIB
found outside the PGC in Bradyrhizobium sp. ORS278 [31].

organisms such as Rba. sphaeroides or Rhodovulum. marinum when
grown under aerobic conditions [37,38]. This is consistent with the
closer phylogenetic relationship of these two organisms to
Roseobacter related photoheterotrophic species (Fig. 1 and Fig.
S2). This indicates the presence of the same carotenoid
biosynthetic pathway in all Rhodobacterales. The central biosynthetic
pathway for carotenoids in the Roseobacter clade is the spheroidene
pathway (Fig. 3, Table S1), and all the necessary genes (crtAIBCDF)
for it are located in the PGCs (Fig. 2 and Table 2).
In most studied Erythrobacter species, erythroxanthin sulfate was
shown to be the main carotenoid [7,39] (Table S1), however, it does
not participate in the photosynthetic processes [39]. Light is
harvested by other pigments such as bacteriorubixanthinal,
zeaxanthin and b-carotene [39]. The main carotenoid identified
in Citromicrobium sp. JL354 was nostoxanthin (Table S1). We assume
that both species share similar carotenoid biosynthetic pathways
(Fig. 3). First, b-carotene is produced from lycopene by the action of
lycopene cyclase (crtY gene product). Zeaxanthin is obtained by two

The biosynthetic pathway for carotenoids in AAP
bacterial strains
A typical feature of AAP bacteria is their pigmentation due to
abundant carotenoids, which spans from yellow/orange to brown
or from pink/red to purple. While some of the carotenoids serve as
harvesting pigments, most of them do not participate in the light
harvesting likely having a photoprotection function [32,33]. As
suggested earlier, spheroidenone is the main light harvesting
carotenoid in Roseobacters [34–36] (Table S1). Spheroidenone is
also produced by anaerobic purple non-sulfur photoautotrophic

step hydroxylation of b-carotene catalyzed by b-carotene hydroxylase (crtZ gene product). Interestingly, the key genes (crtY and crtZ)
for zeaxanthin pathway are not organized in the PGCs, but are
spread throughout the chromosome (Table 2). Zeaxanthin is then a
starting intermediade for synthesis of both nostoxanthin (in genus
Citromicrobium) and erythroxanthin (in genus Erythrobacter) (Fig. 3).
The major carotenoids in Cb. litoralis KT71 is spirilloxanthin,
the same as in Rhodospirillum rubrum DSM 467T [10] (Table S1).
There are two possible options for spirilloxanthin biosynthesis:
typical-spirilloxanthin biosynthestic pathway and unusual-spirilloxanthin pathway (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the gene crtD was found
to be out of PGC in Cb. litoralis KT71 (Table 2), indicating that Cb.
litoralis KT71 might use the shorter unusual-spirilloxanthin
pathway.
In summary, this study showed that most of the photosynthetic
genes in AAP species were organized in the PGC. Two conserved
regions bchFNBHLM-LhaA-puhABC and crtF-bchCXYZ, were identified in all studied PGC. Based on their orientation we can divide
the studied strains into four different groups. The composition of
bch, puf and puh genes in the analyzed PGCs was relatively similar,
and the main difference was found among crt genes. Such
variability was mainly connected with different carotenoid
biosynthetic pathways present in AAP groups: spheroidenone
biosynthetic pathway in Roseobacters, zeaxanthin pathway in
Sphingomonadales and spirilloxanthin pathway in gammaproteobacterial NOR5/OM60 clade. Our investigation shed light on the
evolution and functional implications of PGCs of marine aerobic
anoxygenic phototrophs.

Six strains were used for pigment analyses: Rsb. denitrificans OCh
114 (DSM 7001), Rsb. litoralis Och 149 (DSM 6996) and Erb. longus
DSM 6997 were purchased from the DSMZ culture collections. D.
shibae JL1447, Cmi. bathyomarinum JL354 and Erythrobacter sp. JL475
were isolated and maintained in the laboratory [22]. The strains
were grown in Erlenmayer flasks with organic rich medium [8] at
room temperature (25uC) using a light-dark cycle. The grown cells
were harvested by centrifugation and extracted using 100%
methanol (in the case of Sphingomonadales species) or 7:2 (vol:vol)
acetone-methanol (in the case of Roseobacter species). The pigment
extract and analysis were done by high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) as described previously [41]. Briefly, the
chromatography was performed using the Agilent 1100 Series
system (Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). Pigments
were separated on a heated (35uC) Phenomenex Luna 3 m C8(2)
100 Å column with binary solvent system (0 min 100% A, 20 min
100% B, 25 min 100% B, 27 min 100% A, 30 min 100% A; A:

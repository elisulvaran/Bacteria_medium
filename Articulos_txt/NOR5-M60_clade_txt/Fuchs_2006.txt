Members of the gammaproteobacterial clade NOR5/OM60 regularly form an abundant part, up to 11%, of the bacterioplankton
community in coastal systems during the summer months. Here,
we report the nearly complete genome sequence of one cultured
representative, Congregibacter litoralis strain KT71, isolated from
North Sea surface water. Unexpectedly, a complete photosynthesis
superoperon, including genes for accessory pigments, was discovered. It has a high sequence similarity to BAC clones from Monterey
Bay [Beja O, Suzuki MT, Heidelberg JF, Nelson WC, Preston CM, et
al. (2002) Nature 415:630 – 633], which also share a nearly identical
gene arrangement. Although cultures of KT71 show no obvious
pigmentation, bacteriochlorophyll a and spirilloxanthin-like carotenoids could be detected by HPLC analysis in cell extracts. The
presence of two potential BLUF (blue light using flavin adenine
dinucleotide sensors), one of which was found adjacent to the
photosynthesis operon in the genome, indicates a light- and
redox-dependent regulation of gene expression. Like other aerobic
anoxygenic phototrophs (AAnPs), KT71 is able to grow neither
anaerobically nor photoautotrophically. Cultivation experiments
and genomic evidence show that KT71 needs organic substrates
like carboxylic acids, oligopeptides, or fatty acids for growth. The
strain grows optimally under microaerobic conditions and actively
places itself in a zone of ⬇10% oxygen saturation. The genome
analysis of C. litoralis strain KT71 identifies the gammaproteobacterial marine AAnPs, postulated based on BAC sequences, as
members of the NOR5/OM60 clade. KT71 enables future experiments investigating the importance of this group of gammaproteobacterial AAnPs in coastal environments.

n 1999, Eilers et al. (1) isolated a bacterial strain designated KT71
from a surface water sample taken near the North Sea island
Helgoland, by direct plating on complex low-nutrient media. Phylogenetic analysis showed that KT71 was the first cultured representative of a cosmopolitan gammaproteobacterial lineage, which
we in the following refer to as the NOR5/OM60 clade (Fig. 1). The
first indication for this clade dates back to 1997, when Rappe et al.
retrieved two 16S rRNA clones, OM60 and OM241, from the
continental shelf off Cape Hatteras, NC (2). In the following years,
many sequences have been retrieved that were related to the clone
OM60 (e.g., refs. 3–8). By the end of 2005, ⬎180 partial and full
length 16S rRNA sequences available within the public databases
were related to KT71 and OM60.
KT71 is a Gram-negative, pleomorphic, strictly aerobic, and
motile bacterium. It is of an average size of 2 ⫻ 0.5 ␮m, has a
generation time of 4.5 h, and often grows in flocs. Based on this
conspicuous trait and the site of isolation, the name Congregibacter litoralis has been proposed. A full taxonomic description
of strain KT71 is currently ongoing (B.M.F., S.S., and R.A.,
unpublished work). Several more strains belonging to the NOR5/
OM60 clade were isolated off the coast of Oregon, in sterilized
seawater, using a high-throughput dilution-to-extinction techwww.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0608046104

nique (9, 10). Meanwhile, representatives of the NOR5/OM60
clade were also isolated from Arctic sea ice (11) and coastal
sediments (12, 13).
FISH with rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes for NOR5/
OM60 confirmed this clade as an abundant component of the
bacterioplankton community in the North Sea around the island
Helgoland (1). By the end of July 1998, up to 8% of the total
bacterioplankton community comprised members of the NOR5/
OM60 clade (1). A second peak of NOR5/OM60 cells was visible
in mid-June (6%). However, NOR5/OM60 was not detected by
FISH during the winter months, October to March, suggesting a
marked seasonality. The fraction of DNA-synthesizing NOR5/
OM60 cells seems to be quite variable. Active DNA synthesis
could be detected in August but not in May 2002, even though
NOR5/OM60 was present in high numbers in both samples (6%
and 11% of total bacterioplankton cell, respectively) (14).
In 2004, KT71 was selected for whole-genome sequencing as part
of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation (GBMF) Marine
Microbiology Initiative. Here, we present data derived from the
analysis of the genome of strain KT71 and from ecophysiological
experiments addressing some of the predictions derived from
genome annotation.
Results and Discussion
Structure and Phylogenetic Analysis of the Photosynthesis (PS)
Operon. The genome annotation of KT71 revealed the presence of

a full PS superoperon (15) (KT71㛭19323–19518) on the smaller of
the two large scaffolds [supporting information (SI) Fig. 4]. Both a
smooth tetranucleotide signature (SI Fig. 5) (16) and the absence
of transposons in the vicinity make it highly unlikely that the PS
operon has been obtained by a recent lateral gene transfer. The
operon consists of the typical subclusters crtEF-bchCXYZ-puf and
bchFNBHLM (Fig. 2) but differs in the global and local arrangement from cultured alpha- and betaproteobacterial anoxygenic
phototrophs (17). In these, the puf gene cluster coding for the
light-harvesting complex I (LHC I) and the photosynthetic reaction
center are usually arranged in the order of pufBA-LMC (18). In

Further analysis also revealed identical arrangement for the crt and
bch genes on both the BAC clones and KT71. A third BAC clone
(EBAC69B03, GenBank accession no. AY458648) shares an identical arrangement of the bchP-pucC-bchG-crtJ-bchFNBHLM-pucCpuhH region with KT71. Based on comparative sequence analyses,
these BAC clones were postulated to originate from Gammaproteobacteria (17). A gene-by-gene comparison of the BAC clones
EBAC65D09, EBAC29C02, and EBAC69B03 with KT71 showed
a high average sequence identity on the amino acid level of 56%,
55%, and 62%, respectively (Fig. 2; SI Table 1). We conclude that
the three BAC clones 65D09, 69B03, and 29C02 indeed originate
from Gammaproteobacteria, more precisely from members of the
NOR5/OM60 clade.
Genes coding for a LHC II and a pucC-like transcriptional
regulator were found clustered together on scaffold 1 (pucBAC:
KT71㛭03072, KT71㛭03077, and KT71㛭03082). The LHC II complex
proteins were most closely related to those of Rhodopseudomonas
palustris (65% and 69% sequence identity in amino acids; best
blast hit).

could not be unambiguously resolved based on the currently available dataset, which is indicated by a multifurcation (73). (*), AY212565, DQ015838,

KT71, it is switched to pufLMC-BA. Interestingly, this gene arrangement is identical to that in two BAC clones, EBAC65D09
(AE008919) and EBAC29C02 (AE008920), retrieved from coastal
bacterioplankton sampled at Moss Landing, CA (Fig. 2) (17).

Pigment Analysis. Cell extracts of KT71 were subjected to spectrochromatographic analysis. Pigments found after consecutive acetone and methanol extractions followed by HPLC analysis showed
the typical profiles for bacteriochlorophyll a (Bchla) with the main
peaks at 360, 580, and 776 nm (Fig. 3A) and a carotenoid-like
compound with absorption maxima at 470, 494, and 532 nm,
respectively (Fig. 3B). The latter absorption maxima are almost
identical to those described for spirilloxanthin detected in Roseateles
depolymerans (19). Significant amounts of Bchla were detected only
in cultures of KT71 growing with light on the oligotrophic MPM-m
(1) medium for an extended time (bacteriochlorophyll concentration of 680 ␮g䡠liter⫺1 after 4 mo). In contrast, Bchla was never found
in cultures grown to stationary phase in the nutrient-rich SYPG
medium or in MPM-m medium without illumination. Genomic
analysis showed that indeed all genes for the synthesis of spirilloxanthin are present. They are clustered together in the PS operon
(crtJ and cluster crtFECBI), except for the crtD gene coding for a
methoxyneurosporene dehydrogenase, which is found 300 kb separated on the first scaffold (KT71㛭07854).
Photoautotrophy vs. Photoheterotrophy. KT71 has all the components necessary for a fully functional photosystem typical of anoxygenic phototrophs: the LHC I and II, a reaction center, and
carotenoid pigments. Physiological tests indicated that KT71 is not
able to grow autotrophically. None of the key genes for autotropic
carbon fixation, like ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate-carboxylase/
oxygenase (Calvin-cycle), ATP-citrate-lyase (reductive citrate cycle), or CO-dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA-synthase (reductive acetylCoA pathway), were found in the genome, which is typical for
aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAnPs) (20). Most likely, KT71
is able to gain energy from light by a light-dependent cyclic electron
transport through the photosystem and the generation of a proton

gradient (20). A proton-driven ATP synthase complex was annotated (KT71㛭04845–04885). Alternatively, the proton gradient
might be converted into a sodium gradient by proton/sodium
antiporters, five of which have been found in the KT71 genome
(e.g., KT71㛭06212 and KT71㛭09322). The sodium gradient in turn
may drive a sodium-dependent ATPase (KT71㛭09367) or may be
directly used by the flagella motor (KT71㛭00645).
First-growth experiments with KT71 suggest an enhanced cell
yield with light. Two flasks containing 960 ml of minimal MPM-m
medium were inoculated with 4 ml of a stationary-phase culture and
incubated for 4 wk at room temperature. From the culture grown
with light from a 60-W light bulb, 32.4 mg of cell mass (dry weight)
could be harvested, whereas from the parallel culture grown in the
dark, only 17.6 mg of cell mass (dry weight) could be obtained.
These experiments have to be regarded as preliminary, because no
parallel experiments were done. Future experiments should also
address starvation survival, because Breznak et al. (21) could show
that the survival half-time of the facultative anaerobic anoxygenic
phototroph Rhodospirillum rubrum (Alphaproteobacteria) was ⬇29fold longer if grown with ambient-light intensities than without
light.
Putative Regulation of PS. Annotation identified two genes containing a member of the sensor family BLUF (blue light using flavin
adenine dinucleotide). One of the BLUF sensors was detected
directly upstream of the PS superoperon. It contains the BLUF
domain at the N terminus of the ORF KT71㛭19323. In Rhodobacter
sphaeroides BLUF forms part of the AppA protein, which regulates
the expression of the PS cluster by sensing and integrating both the
light and redox regimes (22). BAC clone EBAC29C02 also contains
a BLUF sensor with a similar structure directly upstream of the PS
operon suggesting an involvement of the BLUF sensor in the light
regulation of the PS operon. Interestingly, in direct vicinity to the
second BLUF sensor (KT71㛭09447), a two component response
regulator (KT71㛭09452) could be found, suggesting, that this BLUF
sensor forms part of a two component system (SI Table 2).
Microaerophily. KT71 is a strictly aerobic organism with a clear

preference for low-oxygen niches. Typical enzymes necessary for
the detoxification of oxygen, a bifunctional catalase-peroxidase
(KT71㛭02962) and a superoxide dismutase (KT71㛭19732), could be
annotated in the genome. It did not grow with nitrate as sole
electron acceptor, nor was it able to ferment. No gene encoding a
dissimilatory nitrate reductase was found in the genome. A putative
sulfite/nitrite reductase-like enzyme (KT71㛭15541) was annotated
but is most likely involved in the assimilatory nitrate or sulfate
reduction.
In deep-agar cultures, KT71 forms distinct bands several
millimeters below the surface. The position of the visible cell
layer depended on the substrate concentration in the medium
and was closer to the surface at higher substrate concentrations.
To determine the exact oxygen concentration for optimal growth
Fuchs et al.

of KT71, oxygen profiles were measured in cultures grown in
SYPG medium with 0.15% (wt/vol) agar (soft agar). An oxygen
profile measured with microsensors from the surface of the soft
agar down to a depth of 8 mm is shown in SI Fig. 6. The highest
cell density was visible at an oxygen saturation of ⬇10% (30 ␮M
O2). Experiments with varying substrate concentrations showed
that KT71 exhibits an excellent chemotaxis for suboxic oxygen
conditions. KT71 is motile and possesses a complete flagellum
operon (gene loci KT71㛭00565–00780). Next to the aa3-type
terminal cytochrome c oxidase (KT71㛭04625–04640), KT71 harbors a cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidase (fixNOQP, KT71㛭16991–
17006). Such terminal cytochrome c oxidases with high oxygen
affinity are expressed only under reduced oxygen conditions in
Bradyrhizobium japonicum (23). In R. sphaeroides, the same
enzyme complex was shown to be involved in the signal transduction and functions as a redox sensor (24) (SI Table 2), which
might be also the case in KT71.
Substrate Spectrum. Substrate utilization tests indicate that KT71

prefers complex substrate mixture for growth (e.g., yeast extract or
Trypticase peptone), whereas many monomeric substrates given as
sole source of carbon and energy are used a little or not at all. As
an exception, KT71 can grow well with carbon sources such as
glutamate, pyruvate, and fatty acids, most likely due to the fact they
play central roles in the metabolism of this organism. Glutamate is
a central metabolite and is presumably taken up by a proton/
sodium-glutamate symport protein (KT71㛭01885). It is further fed
by two glutamate dehydrogenases into the trichloroacetic acid cycle
(KT71㛭16246 and KT71㛭18661) or into the proline synthesis pathway (glutamate-5-kinase, KT71㛭02697). Pyruvate is presumably
being metabolized by a pyruvate-dehydrogenase (KT71㛭00115) and
further metabolized by the citric acid cycle.
Annotation identified all genes necessary to perform the complete pentose phosphate pathway. This pathway plays a central role
in the anabolism of nucleotides and amino acids as well as the
generation of reducing power by NADPH synthesis. Laboratory
experiments have shown that KT71 is not able to use glucose as sole
source of carbon and energy. Alonso and Pernthaler (25) could not
detect any glucose uptake of NOR5/OM60 in situ under both oxic
and anoxic conditions in the North Sea for the entire NOR5/OM60
clade. In the genome, all genes for glycolysis are present, except for
the initial activating enzymes. Neither a glucose phosphorylating
glucokinase nor an intact phosphotransferase system (PTS) was
found. For the latter, only the specific phosphorcarrier HPr
(KT71㛭10197) and a single-chain EIIA of the PTS could be
annotated (KT71㛭10207).
The genome contains several genes coding for putative lipase/
esterases and proteases/peptidases that might be involved in the
breakdown of lipids and peptides. In the laboratory, no hydrolysis
of the polysaccharides starch, cellulose, or chitin by KT71 could be
detected, in line with the annotation of the genome. A lipase/
esterase activity could be confirmed by the hydrolysis of the

artificial substrates Tween 80 (Polyoxyethylenesorbitan monooleate) and Tween 20 (Polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate).
Gelatin and casein were tested negatively as potential substrates for
proteases and peptidases. Although proteases can have a high
specificity for distinct substrates, this finding points to a preferred
utilization of oligopeptides or partly degraded proteins by KT71.
Two transporters for oligopeptides with up to five amino acids were
found, oppABC (KT71㛭06839–06854) and oppF (KT71㛭00435).
Culture experiments show that KT71 is able to synthesize all
essential amino acids and most of the vitamins, except for biotin,
thiamin, and vitamin B12. Two TonB-dependent vitamin B12
sensors (KT71㛭17391 and KT71㛭18621) and an ABC vitamin B12
transporter system btuCDF (KT71㛭17396–17411) were found in the
genome. The annotation is consistent with this auxotrophy and the
inability to use many substrates (e.g., glucose) as single sources of
carbon and energy.
Storage Compounds. Two highly similar genes coding for cyanophy-

cin synthetases were found in tandem (KT71㛭18591 and
KT71㛭18596; 38% identical amino acids). Cyanophycin synthetase
is described as a homodimer but was also considered to form
heterodimers of the type CphA and CphA⬘ (26). Both genes have
high similarity to the cphA genes in the Gammaproteobacteria
Colwellia psychoerythraea 34H and Francisella tularensis (59% and
56% identity for the long CphA and 33% and 30% amino acid
identity for the short CphA⬘, respectively). Cyanophycin is a polymer of aspartic acid and arginine. It was first found as a storage
compound in cyanobacteria and subsequently detected in many
heterotrophic bacteria. The polymer forms insoluble granula inside
the cell that can be extracted with diluted acids (27). Cells containing highly refractile granulas could be mainly observed in
stationary cultures of KT71 grown under conditions of a high ratio
of nitrogen to carbon. Cyanophycin was identified in these granula
by a negative reaction with the lipophilic stain, Nile blue A, and
dissolution in diluted HCl (see SI Fig. 7). A cyanophycinase was not
annotated, but most likely the polypeptide is degraded by an
unknown peptidase. The formation of polyphosphate is not yet
confirmed by physiological tests but two enzymes, an inorganic
polyphosphate/ATP-NAD kinase (KT71㛭14354) and a polyphosphate kinase (KT71㛭16696), were found in the genome.
Formation of Aggregates and Polysaccharide Production. In pure

cultures of KT71, the formation of large flocs was observed (SI Fig.
8A). There is microscopic evidence that members of the NOR5/
OM60 clade attaches also in nature to macroscopic particles (SI Fig.
8B). Genome analyses revealed several features consistent with
aggregation. Several loci in the KT71 genome code for the synthesis
of type IV pili or fimbriae (28). The formation of pili seems to be
regulated by a sensory mechanism encoded by the genes pilS
(KT71㛭19657) and pilR (KT71㛭19662; SI Table 2). In addition, two
operons were found containing exopolymer producing proteins
(KT71㛭09752–09807 and KT71㛭06404–06469). These operons
comprised genes for polysaccharide length-determinant proteins
[KT71㛭09767 and KT71㛭06439), (exo)-polysaccharide biosynthesis
protein (KT71㛭09772 and KT㛭066454), polysaccharide polymerases
(KT71㛭009807), polysaccharide export proteins (KT71㛭09762 and
KT71㛭06444)], and some glycosyltransferases (e.g., KT71㛭06459,
KT71㛭06434, KT71㛭09787, and KT71㛭06429). Interestingly, each of
the operons contains a two-component sensor kinases/response
regulator (SI Table 2). Based on the current annotation, it is not
clear to which stimuli they respond.
Sulfur Metabolism. KT71 most likely uses the APS/PAPS pathway
to obtain reduced sulfur compounds. Three genes coding for the
key enzymes of that pathway were annotated in KT71, a sulfate
adenylyltransferase (KT71㛭10572), an adenylylsulfate kinase
(KT71㛭10567), and a phosphoadenosine phosphosulfate reductase
(KT71㛭06329). Genome annotation revealed that the gene cluster
2894 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0608046104

soxH-RCDXYZA-B is potentially involved in the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (KT71㛭03447–03482 and KT71㛭03497).
This cluster contains the core gene set soxXYZAB, which is found
in many species capable of oxidizing reduced sulfur compounds
(29). A comparison with other sulfur-oxidizing organisms shows
that the gene arrangement soxH-RCDXYZA-B is unique to KT71
and has not been found in any of the species described to date.
Unlike in Silicibacter pomeryoi (30), the supplementation of media
with the inorganic sulfur compounds thiosulfate or sulfur did not
significantly promote growth of KT71 in cultivation experiments
using different carbon sources. The inability to gain additional
energy by the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds
may be due to the lack of several sox genes compared with the
exemplary cluster of sox genes found in the genome of Paracoccus
pantotrophus or S. pomeroyi (30). Of special interest is the lack of
the gene soxV that codes in P. pantotrophus GB17 for a membrane
protein that is predicted to transfer electrons from the cytoplasma
to the periplasmic thioredoxin soxW (31). It was shown that
inactivation of SoxV in P. pantotrophus and the phototrophic
bacterium Rhodovulum sulfidophilum leads to a phenotype that is
unable to use thiosulfate for energy conservation (32, 33). Despite
this finding, the possibility exists that KT71 can use alternative
sulfur compounds like dimethylsulfoniopropionate or dimethylsulfide that were not tested yet. These compounds are present in high
amounts after algal blooms and are metabolized by Roseobacter
species (34, 35).
C. litoralis: A Typical Shelf Bacterium? KT71 was isolated from

coastal surface water in the rather shallow German Bight. There,
the water column is close to oxygen saturation during most of the
year. It came as a surprise that KT71 avoids sites with oxygen
saturation and grows optimally under microaerobic conditions. In
coastal areas, suboxic conditions are found, temporarily, in large
macroscopic aggregates (36), and permanently a few millimeters
below the sediment surface (37). Therefore, we hypothesize that the
habitat range of KT71 includes particles and sediment surfaces.
Shallow shelf areas are characterized by extensive mixing of the
water, sediment interface by tides, or wind stress. Resuspension of
sediment particles into the water column is followed by periods of
sedimentation. Thereby, in temperate coastal systems like the
German Bight, marine microorganisms are faced with pronounced
fluctuations of multiple parameters such as substrate, nutrient, and
oxygen concentrations, as well as light levels on a daily and seasonal
scale. Based on our genomic and ecophysiological data, KT71
seems well adapted to such a dynamic shallow shelf environment.
Organic particles are nutrient-rich hotspots in the otherwise
oligotrophic water column (38). By attaching to their surfaces,
KT71 may directly use mono- and oligomeric substrates or may
benefit, as a commensal, from the exoenzymatic activities of
polymer-degrading bacteria such as Rhodopirellula baltica (39) and
Gramella forsetii (40). The possibility that KT71 is actively shaping
its environment by facilitating the formation of ‘‘marine snow’’ by
polysaccharide production needs to be addressed in future studies.
Particle association also serves as a transport mechanism to the
sediment surface. There, KT71 may thrive on low-molecular-weight
substrates like peptides or lipids that accumulate on the sea
floor (41).
The presence of a complete mercury-resistance operon
(KT71㛭16196–16226) in the genome of KT71 is consistent with a
prevalence of this strain in the suboxic zone of sediments. It is
known that low-redox potentials and the degradation of complex
organic matter in upper sediment layers lead to the mobilization of
active mercury species in the form of inorganic ions (Hg2⫹) or weak
inorganic complexes (see, e.g., ref. 42). In a recent study, depth
profiles of reactive mercury species were determined in North Sea
sediment, and it was found that peak values are reached at the
sediment water interface (43). Hence, genes that confer resistance
to toxic mercury ions may be much more important for bacteria
Fuchs et al.

Significance of the NOR5/OM60 Clade Represented by KT71. It has

been estimated that AAnPs account for ⱖ10% of the bacterioplankton community in the oligotrophic open ocean (45–47). More
recent studies have shown that AAnPs may be less important in the
open ocean (⬇1%) (48) but can reach up to 15% abundance in
eutrophic and mesotrophic coastal areas (49, 50). Currently, the
alphaproteobacterial Roseobacter clade is considered to be the
dominant group of marine AAnPs (35, 51, 52). The discovery of
BAC clones with PS operons showing best BLAST hits to Gammaproteobacteria (17) clearly suggested the existence of a second
group of AAnPs. The genome analysis of C. litoralis strain KT71
identifies this microorganism as a cultured representative of
the gammaproteobacterial marine AAnPs, enabling future experiments investigating the importance of gammaproteobacterial
AAnPs in coastal environments by using KT71 as a model
organism.
Materials and Methods
Sequencing and Assembly. Sequencing of KT71 was done in a

conventional whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach. Two
genomic libraries with insert sizes of 4 and 40 kb were made as
described in Goldberg et al. (53). The prepared plasmid and fosmid
clones were sequenced from both ends to provide paired-end reads
at the J. Craig Venter Science Foundation Joint Technology Center
on Applied Biosystems 3730XL DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Whole-genome random shotgun sequencing produced 38,544 good reads averaging 892 bp in length, for a
total of ⬇34.38 Mbp of microbial DNA sequence (⫽7.53 ⫻
coverage).
The genome of KT71 contains ⬇4.36 Mb with an average GC
content of 57.7% and is deposited under GenBank accession no.
AAOA00000000. Successful reads for each organism were used as
input for the Celera Assembler (54). Data are released to the
GBMF Marine Microbial Genome Sequencing Project web site
(https://research.venterinstitute.org/moore) and GenBank. A genome report compliant with the ‘‘Minimum Information about a
Genome Sequence specification’’ is available from the Genome
Catalog at www.genomics.ceh.ac.uk/genomecatalogue.
Analysis of the Genome Architecture. The cumulative GC-skew

([G⫺C]/[G⫹C]) was computed with a custom PERL script (SI
Fig. 9). Genome-wide fluctuations of the GC-skew, AT-skew,
GC-content, DNA curvature and DNA bending, (SI Fig. 4) were
computed with custom PERL scripts and the programs banana and
btwisted from the EMBOSS suite (55), respectively, and visualized
with GeneWiz (56). The positions of all genes and subsets of related

genes (SI Fig. 4) were visualized with the program GenomePlot
(57). Genome-wide fluctuations in tetranucleotide composition (SI
Fig. 5) were calculated and plotted with the program TETRA (16).
Gene Prediction and Annotation of the Genome Sequence. Potential

protein-coding genes were identified by the Prokaryotic Genomes
Automatic Annotation Pipeline (PGAAP) of the National Center
for Biotechnology Information. PGAAP combines three distinct
gene finders, GenMark (58), GenMark.hmm (59), and Glimmer2
(60), and parses the individual results using a conflict-resolving
strategy. BLAST analysis of the intergenic regions resulted in
finding one additional short ORF (pufB, KT71㛭19424). Transfer
RNA genes were identified by using tRNAScan-SE (61), and
ribosomal RNA genes were detected by standard BLAST similarity
searches (62) against public nucleotide databases.
Annotation of the genome sequence was performed with the
GenDB v2.2 annotation system (63). For each ORF, similarity
searches against various sequence databases (NCBI nr, NCBI nt,
and SwissProt) and protein family databases (Pfam, Prosite, InterPro, and COG) were performed. In addition, potential signal
peptides were predicted with SignalP Ver. 2.0 (64), and potential
transmembrane helices were predicted with TMHMM Ver. 2.0
(65). Based on this information, all ORFs were automatically
annotated in a fuzzy logic-based approach (66). This automatic
annotation was extensively manually checked and refined for each
ORF. Predicted protein-coding genes were functionally classified
according to COG Ver. 3 (67) (see SI Text).
Comparative Sequence Analyses. 16S rRNA gene sequences related
to KT71 were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information and imported into a 16S rRNA database.
Phylogenetic reconstructions were done with the ARB package
(www.arb-home.de) (68) by using maximum parsimony, maximum
likelihood, and neighbor-joining methods with different filters and
matrices (see SI Text).
Physiological Tests. KT71 was routinely grown and maintained
either in the oligotrophic MPM-m medium described by ref. 1 (see
SI Tables 3–7 for details) or in the complex medium SYPG
containing the following compounds per liter of distilled water:
35.0 g of sea salts, 0.5 g of yeast extract, 0.25 g of Trypticase peptone,
and 0.1 g of sodium L-glutamate. Utilization of substrates was tested
in a mineral medium containing (per liter) 35.0 g of sea salts, 0.1 g
of NH4Cl, 0.05 g of K2HPO4, and 10 ml of a vitamin solution (see
DSMZ medium 141, www.dsmz.de). Standard tests for the detection of enzymes like catalase, oxidase, lipase/esterase, and proteases
were done according to the protocols given in ref. 69. Oxygen
measurements in soft-agar medium were done with a Clark-type
oxygen microelectrode, as described (70).
HPLC Analysis of Photosynthetic Pigments. Pigments from cell pellets

of KT71 were obtained by freeze drying and consecutive acetone
and methanol extraction with sonication. HPLC analyses of cell
extracts were done on a Waters 2690 Separation Modul (Waters,
Eschborn, Germany) with a 250 ⫻ 4.6-mm vortex column packed
with Eurospher-100 C 18 (particle size, 5 ␮m; Knauer, Berlin,
Germany) and a Waters 996 Photodiode Array Detector. The
mobile phase was chosen after Wright and Jeffrey (71). Bchla was
identified by retention-time coinjection of a Bchla standard from
Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides (Sigma–Aldrich, Taufkirchen,
Germany) and spectrography at 384 nm. The quantity of Bchla was
estimated from the areas under the peaks, which were calibrated
with the Bchla standard. No standard was available for the spirilloxanthin-like compound, but the carotenoid was identified by
comparison with similar spectra at similar retention times from, e.g.,
ref. 72.

MICROBIOLOGY

dwelling in the surface sediment than for bacteria indigenous to the
water column.
A specific highlight of KT71 is the presence of a PS superoperon.
It is becoming more clear that photoheterotrophy is widespread
among marine microorganisms (17, 44). By the light-driven generation of a proton gradient, KT71 might be able to survive extended
periods of starvation, e.g., during the winter period. The storage
compounds cyanophycin and polyphosphate are yet another adaptation to famine situations. Interestingly, in contrast to all other
AAnPs known to date, KT71 produces only trace amounts of
carotenoids and shows no obvious pigmentation (SI Fig. 8c).
Because a major function of carotenoids is the protection of cells
from damage by UV radiation, this may reflect an adaptation to
low-light zones, i.e., depths of several meters in the water column
or subsurface sediment layers in shallow water. Recently, strongly
pigmented strains closely related to KT71 were isolated from
surface sediments in the Wadden Sea, suggesting the ability of
members of the NOR5/OM60 clade to adapt also to high light
conditions (J. Harder, personal communication). These strains will
also allow us to determine whether PS is a general feature of the
NOR5/OM60 clade.

Jakob Pernthaler initially suggested sequencing KT71 in the framework of the Marine Microbiology Sequencing Initiative of the GBMF.
Sequencing, assembly, and annotation efforts were supported by the
GBMF as part of its Marine Microbial Sequencing Project
(www.moore.org/marinemicro). We thank Granger Sutton and his
team for the ongoing development and maintenance of the Celera
Assembler and related tools and Aaron Sutton for help with specific
analysis issues. The JCVI software team, under the leadership of Saul
A. Kravitz, manages assembly, annotation, and Web delivery of data
for the GBMF-funded project (http://research.venterinstitute.org/
moore). We thank Robert Friedman for his leadership of the GBMFfunded project. Many thanks for help with pigment extraction and
HPLC analysis to Gabriele Klockgether and Raphaela Shoon. Armin

Gieseke is acknowledged for help with the microsensor measurements.

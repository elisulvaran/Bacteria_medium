Abstract
The phylogeny, abundance, and biogeography of the NOR5/OM60 clade was investigated. This clade includes
‘‘Congregibacter litoralis’’ strain KT71, the ﬁrst cultured representative of marine aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic
Gammaproteobacteria. More than 500 16S rRNA sequences afﬁliated with this clade were retrieved from public
databases. By comparative sequence analysis, 13 subclades could be identiﬁed, some of which are currently restricted
to discrete habitat types. Almost all sequences in the largest subclade NOR5-1 and related subclade NOR5-4
originated from marine surface water samples. Overall, most of the NOR5/OM60 sequences were retrieved from
marine coastal settings, whereas there were fewer from open-ocean surface waters, deep-sea sediment, freshwater,
saline lakes and soil.
The abundance of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade in various marine sites was determined by ﬂuorescence in situ
hybridization using a newly designed and optimized probe set. Relative abundances in coastal marine waters off
Namibia and the Yangtze estuary were up to 3% of the total 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) counts, and in the
German Bight off Helgoland the abundance was even up to 7%. In an open-ocean North Atlantic transect, between
Iceland and the Azores, the NOR5/OM60 group was much less abundant (0.1–0.5%). Interestingly, the surface layer
of North Sea intertidal sediments was very rich in NOR5/OM60, with absolute numbers 4108 cells cm3 (or 4% of the
total DAPI). An analysis of the frequencies of NOR5/OM60 16S rRNA genes in the Global Ocean Survey datasets
provided further support for a marine cosmopolitan occurrence of NOR5/OM60, and a clear preference for coastal
marine waters.

important role in marine carbon cycling [33,34]. They
also seem to be highly abundant in the oceans. Recent
studies based on infrared microscopy showed abundances of 4.572.4% with a maximum of 13.5% in
coastal waters, while in oceanic water the frequency was
lower at 1.571.3% [30,56,62]. For a long time, all
cultured representatives of marine AAnP belonged to

ARTICLE IN PRESS

the class Alphaproteobacteria. This recently changed
when genome analyses of marine gammaproteobacterial
isolates revealed the presence of complete photosynthesis superoperons [22]. The North Sea isolate KT71 was
identiﬁed as AAnP based on the expression of photosynthetic pigments [22]. In parallel, HTCC2080, one of
three gammaproteobacterial strains obtained by highthroughput cultivation from coastal Paciﬁc surface
water off Oregon, was shown to grow faster and to
have higher cell yield with light rather than in the dark
[12]. All four isolates are from one monophyletic
gammaproteobacterial clade that had been predicted
based on metagenomics [8,58].
The history of this clade dates back to 1995, when a
284 bp gammaproteobacterial 16S rRNA sequence
retrieved from Sargasso Sea surface water was referred
to as SAR125 (L35466) [47]. In 1997, two almost fulllength sequences were found to be closely related to
SAR125; clones OM60 (U70696) and OM241 (U70702)
were from a marine coastal site off North Carolina,
USA [51]. In 1999, strain KT71 (AY007676) was
isolated from marine surface water at the ‘‘Kabeltonne’’
station off the island of Helgoland, North Sea [19].
Strain KT71 was placed in a group named NOR5, and
recently the binominal name ‘‘Congregibacter litoralis’’
has been suggested for this isolate [22]. Several related
strains isolated by a novel high-throughput culturing
method, including HTCC2080, were placed in the
OM60/OM241 clade [14], which was later referred to
as the OM60 clade [11]. Since all these clade names
are now largely redundant, we refer to it here as the
NOR5/OM60 clade [22] and, currently, many more
related sequences can be found in various databases.
Based on comparative 16S rRNA sequence analysis,
the NOR5/OM60 clade is most closely related to the
genera Endobugula, Microbulbifer, Teredinibacter
(all Alteromonadales), Cellvibrio (Pseudomonadales)
and several other groups of oligotrophic marine
Gammaproteobacteria, including the clades BD1-7,
KI89A, OM182 and SAR92 [11]. A sequence retrieved
from deep-sea sediment, BD2-7 (AB015537) [37],
was considered to represent a sister clade to the
NOR5/OM60 clade.
Data on the biogeography of the NOR5/OM60 clade
are so far sparse. Besides the mostly qualitative evidence
from sequence retrieval there is also some quantiﬁcation
by ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The probe
NOR5-730 has yielded counts in North Sea surface
water of up to 8% [19], and even 11% [48] of all
DAPI-stained cells. With the same probe, an abundance
of 3.471.1% was detected in a Paciﬁc coastal transect
along the Newport Hydroline [12], where maximum
numbers of up to 1  105 cells ml1 were linked to the
chlorophyll maximum.
The goals of this study were to provide a more
detailed description of the phylogeny of the

125

NOR5/OM60 clade and to analyze its geographic
distribution, as well as abundance, in the marine
environment. Therefore, all available NOR5/OM60
16S rRNA sequences from public databases were
mapped. This information originated mostly from
PCR-based clone libraries, but also encompassed
isolates and the metagenomic Global Ocean Survey
(GOS) [52]. Based on this comprehensive dataset the
speciﬁcity of published 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes was checked, and new ones were designed.
A probe mixture was optimized for a catalyzed reporter
deposition FISH (CARD-FISH) assay. With this, the
abundance of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade was
quantiﬁed in coastal marine sites off China, Namibia,
Spain, and Germany, as well as in an open-ocean
transect in the North Atlantic.

Materials and methods
Sequence retrieval
NOR5/OM60-related 16S rRNA sequences were
initially retrieved with the ARB program (http://
www.arb-home.de/) [43] from the SILVA database
(Version 91) [50] (http://www.arb-silva.de/) by targeting
group-speciﬁc signatures (e.g. complement to probe
NOR5-730 with 0–2 mismatches). Highly related sequences were also identiﬁed using Blastn (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), and imported into
the database. Additionally, the 16S rRNA subset of
the Camera GOS Cruise, a metagenomic project that
sampled various environments, including pelagic and
coastal seawater, fresh water or hypersalinic environments [52], was downloaded (http://web.camera.calit2.
net/) and analyzed in a similar way.
In total, more than 500 16S rRNA sequences
including 147 almost full-length sequences with a length
of 41400 nucleotides were collected. Sequences were
manually checked for sequence quality and chimera,
using the pintail value [5] provided with the SILVA 16S
rRNA gene database and using the program ‘‘chimera
check’’ at the website of the ribosomal database project
(http://rdp8.cme.msu.edu/cgis/chimera.cgi?su=SSU)
[13]. Twenty-eight probably chimeric NOR5/OM60
sequences were used only for biogeographic studies,
but not for phylogenetic analysis or probe design. The
sequences were aligned using the ARB aligner, and
added to the universal parsimony tree using ‘‘ARB
parsimony’’ with a ‘‘positional variability by parsimony’’ ﬁlter for Bacteria [50].
The 16S rRNA sequences from 22 newly isolated
strains from sediment off the North Sea island Sylt
(55.011N, 8.261E) were determined by standard
molecular techniques (PCR, sequencing) and submitted

structed. Subsequently, the trees obtained using the
three ﬁltered sets and four methods were compared
manually. Groups that were stable in all or most of the
trees were named as subclades. Whenever the branching
patterns varied in many of the trees, a multifurcation
was introduced at that position [42].

Phylogeny
All the qualiﬁed, almost full-length sequences
(41400 nt) that belonged to the NOR5/OM60 clade,
as well as several closely related outgroup sequences
(in total around 150 sequences), were selected for
phylogenetic reconstructions. Three column ﬁlters were
made in ARB and were used for selecting the columns
with certain conservative levels for calculation. Each
ﬁlter kept 1493, 1450 and 1393 bases, respectively. The
sequences were ﬁltered into different datasets, and each
was then used as input for four different algorithms:
‘‘ARB neighbor joining’’ (Felsenstein correction),
‘‘ARB parsimony interactive’’, Maximum likelihood
using AxML, and the posterior possibility algorithm
using MrBayes (Version 3.1, http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/)
[27]. The MrBayes trees were built according to the
manual (http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/manual.php) with
settings of a likelihood model in two parallel runs, each
containing four chains. The program ran until the
‘‘average standard deviation of split frequencies’’
became less than 0.1. Then, the ﬁrst thousand trees of
the unstable generations were ‘‘burnt in’’ using ‘‘halfcompat’’, and MrBayes consensus trees were con-

Table 1.

Probe design, check and optimization
The ‘‘probe check’’ module in the ARB program was
used to check probes NOR5-730 and NOR5-130 [19] for
coverage and speciﬁcity, but also to design new probes
for NOR5/OM60 subclades. Only sequences with
41400 nt were used for probe design. Candidate probes
were also checked against the 16S rRNA sequence
databases, including the partial sequences. Helper and
competitor nucleotides were designed and tested as
described before [21,46] (Table 1). The probes
were optimized by performing hybridization with all
the relevant helpers and competitors at varying formamide concentrations [23]. Optimizations were carried
out at 46 1C on pure cultures with a fully complementary
16S rRNA.

Biogeographic analysis
For each of the NOR5/OM60 sequences retrieved
from the databases, the geographic and environmental
data were manually collected, either directly from

Vision cruise
The Vision cruise was conducted in the period
September 20–October 3, 2006. Sampling was carried
out along the transect 301W, from Iceland to the south
of the Azores Islands, from surface waters (mostly at a
depth of 10 m, SI Table 1). All water samples were ﬁxed,
ﬁltered and stored as described for the Yangtze estuary.

Data included longitude, latitude, depth or altitude, and
habitat information in categories such as marine water,
hypersaline water or fresh water. The resulting table
(SI Table 3) was the basis for creating the biogeographic
map shown in Fig. 3. Results of the CARD-FISH with
probe NOR5-730 and NOR5-1238 were also included in
the map.

Sampling sites and procedures

Samples were taken from a depth of 1 m at station
‘‘Kabeltonne’’, Helgoland (54.181N, 7.901E), German
Bight, on seven separate days from May to July 2007
(see Table 2 for details) and from Cuxhaven in July
2007. The water samples from Helgoland were ﬁrst preﬁltered at 10 mm to remove large particles and then ﬁxed,
ﬁltered and stored as described for the Yangtze estuary.
The water samples from Cuxhaven were treated
identically but they were not pre-ﬁltered.

North Sea sediment
The sediment samples were sampled from a sandy
intertidal ﬂat at Janssand (53.721N, 7.681E), German
North Sea coast, in March and August 2007. Each time
two adjacent cores were sampled for duplicates,
and subsampled for each 1 cm range. The subsamples
were ﬁxed and sonicated, then the supernatant was
ﬁltered onto polycarbonate ﬁlters, as described previously [41,49].

Yangtze River estuary

Small sampling campaigns

On September 6–8, 2006, a small cruise was undertaken in the Yangtze River estuary (Fig. 1). Samples
were taken from surface water, and immediately ﬁxed
with 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h, ﬁltered onto
polycarbonate ﬁlters (Millipore, 47 mm in diameter,
0.2 mm pore size) and stored frozen at 20 1C.

A summary of all additional sampling stations is
given in Table 2. Surface water samples from Xiamen,
China were taken in September 2006 at the Xiamen ferry
port, and in July 2007 from a sandy coast near Xiamen
University. Other marine water samples were obtained
from Southampton dock water, UK, and coastal water
near Barcelona, Spain. Fresh water samples from the
river Weser and freshwater ponds in Bremen were also
checked for comparison. All the water samples were
treated as described above for the Yangtze River
sample. Other sediment samples were taken from
intertidal sandy surface sediment from Sylt on the
German North Sea coast. The samples were ﬁxed,
sonicated and processed as described above for North
Sea sediment samples.

Namibian upwelling region
The cruise took place on March 22–23, 2003, along
231S near Walvis Bay, from the coast into the Atlantic
Ocean (14.4–12.01E), through the Benguela Current.
Surface water samples (10 m) from 13 stations, as well as
three depth proﬁles, were collected and immediately
ﬁxed in 1% PFA for 1 h at room temperature or for 24 h
at 4 1C. Subsequently, samples were kept frozen at
80 1C. For FISH, samples were carefully thawed,
ﬁltered onto polycarbonate ﬁlters (Millipore, 47 mm in
diameter, 0.2 mm pore size) and further processed for
FISH (see below).

CARD-FISH
CARD-FISH was undertaken according to Pernthaler et al. [49] with the following modiﬁcations: agaroseembedded ﬁlters were permeabilized with 10 mg ml1

performed at 46 1C for 3 h, and washing was carried
out at 48 1C for 15 min. For the quantiﬁcation of most
of the members of the NOR5/OM60 groups, a
combination of NOR5-730 and NOR5-1238 with all
four helpers was used (Table 1). Signal ampliﬁcation
was carried out for 15 min with a ﬂuorescein-labeled
tyramide. All CARD-FISH preparations were counterstained with DAPI. The relative abundance of hybridized cells was estimated as a ratio of hybridized cell
counts to counts of DAPI-stained cells using epiﬂuorescence microscopy. At least 500 DAPI-stained cells
were counted. To check for autoﬂuorescence or un-

speciﬁc binding of the probe or tyramide, all samples
were checked with the non-binding probe NON. The
speciﬁcity of the NOR5-speciﬁc probes was checked
with CARD-FISH on PFA-ﬁxed cultures of Congregibacter litoralis KT71.

Outgroup

Fig. 2. Consensus tree reconstructed based on almost full-length (41400 nt) 16S rRNA sequences of members of the NOR5/OM60
clade. Underlined names are cultured isolates and subclades that include cultured isolates. The black and grey bars on the left of the
branches show the clades that can be targeted by probes NOR5-730 and NOR5-1238, respectively, and the dashed lines for partly
targeted subclades.

on more than 150 almost full-length NOR5/OM60 and
closely related 16S rRNA gene sequences, a new
consensus tree was calculated (Fig. 2). With all treeing
methods, the NOR5/OM60 clade formed a monophyletic group within Gammaproteobacteria. In contrast to
earlier trees based on less sequences [11,22] the current
reconstruction of the NOR5/OM60 clade now also
includes, besides the sequences from strain KT71 and
clones OM60 and OM241, a cluster of freshwater clones
and BD2-7, a clone retrieved from the deep sea. Another
deep-sea sequence, BD1-7, was still excluded from the

NOR5/OM60 clade. Sequence identities within
NOR5/OM60 were typically 492%, whereas identities
to outgroup sequences were usually below 92%.
However, exceptions did occur (e.g. due to imperfect
sequence quality) and therefore sequence identity alone
was insufﬁcient to include or exclude a new sequence
from the NOR5/OM60 clade.
The exact branching within the NOR5/OM60 clade
depended on the algorithms and ﬁlters used for
reconstruction. There were stable subclades in which
the same sequences always clustered together. However,

sequence in the terrestrial subclade NOR5-13, which
also included 13 partial sequences recovered from fresh
water, fresh water sediment or soil. Five more partial
sequences retrieved from fresh water studies (EF192914,
EF192886, EF192904, AY214643 and AY214720)
[18,40] did not group in the NOR5-13 subclade.
About 30% of NOR5/OM60 sequences could not be
grouped into any of the above-mentioned subclades,
and most of these were partial sequences. The representatives of each subclade and closely related outgroups are listed in SI Table 2 as hallmarks for
categorizing further sequences. The full list of all
NOR5/OM60 sequences retrieved in this study, either
full-length or partial, is shown in SI Table 3.

the relationship between the subclades was unstable.
The largest subclade was labeled as NOR5-1, and it
comprised more than one-third of all the available fulllength sequences, as well as many partial sequences.
NOR5-1 showed two stable subgroups. The largest was
NOR5-1A with more than 90 full and partial sequences
(50% of NOR5-1). NOR5-1C also seemed to be
monophyletic, which did not apply to the other
sequences
of
NOR5-1
(‘‘NOR5-1B’’),
which
included strain HTCC2080 and several North Sea
strains, such as Ivo14. Another stable subclade was
NOR5-4, which was the sister group of NOR5-1 in
most of the trees.
Subclade NOR5-3 included the 16S rRNA sequence
of ‘‘Congregibacter litoralis’’ KT71, as well as that of 17
other NOR5/OM60 strains which have all been recently
isolated from the oxic layer of marine surface sediment
of the German island Sylt. However, only a few
environmental clone sequences fell into this subclade.
Subclades NOR5-2 and NOR5-7 were close to NOR5-3
in most phylogenetic reconstructions. They currently
comprise only a few sequences, including those of the
NEP isolates obtained from Japanese marine coastal
sediments [45], and an isolate from coastal marine water
sampled off Banyuls-sur-Mer [1,2].
Subclades NOR5-5, NOR5-6, NOR5-8, NOR5-9 and
NOR5-11 together contained one-ﬁfth of all the
NOR5/OM60 sequences. Subgroups NOR5-10 and
NOR5-12 were deeply branched in most of the trees
and they were dominated by sequences obtained from
the deep sea. BD2-7 was the only full-length sequence of

Biogeography
The geographic information was compiled for all
identiﬁcations of members of the NOR5/OM60 clade
(Fig. 3). This included identiﬁcation by isolation, 16S
rRNA gene libraries, metagenomic studies, and by
ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). So far, only
14 isolates have been reported from marine water or
coastal marine sediment (SI Table 4). Here, we report 22
more NOR5/OM60 strains isolated from surface sediments of an intertidal sandﬂat from the North Sea island

The numbers in the table give the number of 16S rRNA sequences retrieved from the public databases for a certain environment. The environmental
conditions of several sequences could not be categorized; therefore the total number of a subclade can be higher than the sum of the listed numbers
from different environments.

of Sylt, Germany, which belonged either to subclades
NOR5-3 (17 strains) or to NOR5-1B (5 strains).
Table 3 lists the habitat preferences for each subclade
according to source materials. The large subclades
NOR5-1 and NOR5-4 appeared almost exclusively in
the marine water column. Subclades NOR5-10 and
NOR5-12 contained mainly identiﬁcations reported
from deep-sea samples, and NOR5-13 was a freshwater
clade. Sequences of the other NOR5/OM60 subclades
were retrieved from marine sediment and the water
column.
The NOR5/OM60 clade is cosmopolitan in the
marine realm. Identiﬁcations have been reported from
almost all oceans and at many coastal sites. In this
respect, the American, European and East Asian coasts
are particularly well covered with 16S rRNA gene
libraries. There seems to be no latitudinal preference
since NOR5/OM60 clones have been reported from
mangrove [38,39] and coral reef [6,20,35], as well as seaice habitats [10].
NOR5/OM60 sequences were also reported in
deep-sea sediments sampled near Antarctica [9] and
Japan [4,28,37], as well as in the northeast Paciﬁc [26]
and the Atlantic (Schauer, unpublished). Additional
reports on NOR5/OM60 sequences come from environments with different salinity: freshwater rivers [54,57], a
rice paddy (DQ830363), freshwater sediments [44,61],
activated sludge [32], soil [25,40], and also from

hypersaline environments [24,36,52]. In addition, there
are some sequences that cannot be placed on a
world map since they are, for instance, from
human plasma (clone NF37-A2; AY886614) [59].
Unlike the alphaproteobacterial RCA-1 cluster [55], it
was still not possible in this study to detect biogeographic patterns for the various NOR5/OM60 subclades, neither latitudinal nor with respect to certain
oceanic provinces.

NOR5/OM60 afﬁliated 16S rRNA genes in the
GOS metagenomics dataset
The GOS dataset [52] contains 3728 16S rRNA gene
sequences with lengths 4300 nt. By comparative sequence analysis, 30 of these sequences (0.8%) could be
unambiguously grouped within the NOR5/OM60 clade.
Therein, 28 belonged to subclade NOR5-1, which is
typical of marine surface water, and two belonged to its
sister subclade NOR5-4. The sequences were found in 21
out of a total of 44 sampling stations. Except for station
GS-04 (Atlantic, Canadian coast, salinity 28.3 psu), in
which four out of a total of 31 16S rRNA gene
sequences afﬁliated with the NOR5/OM60 clade,
all the other libraries contained at most two NOR5/
OM60 sequences. No sequences were found at low
salinity stations (GS-12, salinity 3.5 psu, and GS-20,

freshwater). NOR5/OM60 16S rRNA sequences were
clearly more frequent in coastal (20/1471; 1.4%) than in
open-ocean samples (5/1516; 0.3%).

Design and optimization of probes for the
quantiﬁcation of the NOR5/OM60 clade
Our comprehensive collection of 16S rRNA sequences
of the NOR5/OM60 clade facilitated a re-evaluation of
oligonucleotide probes targeting this group. Probe
NOR5-730 (Table 1) has been used in several studies
for FISH-based quantiﬁcation of members of the
NOR5/OM60 clade [19]. This probe covered 131 out
of 155 (84%) high-quality, almost full-length 16S rRNA
sequences of the NOR5/OM60 clade included in the
SILVA Ref dataset (Version 91) [50]. The probe design
function of ARB [43] was used in an attempt to
design new probes with an improved coverage of the
NOR5/OM50 clade. However, it was not possible to
design a single probe that perfectly matched all the
NOR5/OM60 sequences without targeting outgroup
sequences. The new probe NOR5-1238 (Table 1)
targeted 46% of all high-quality NOR5/OM60 sequences, excluding the two major subclades NOR5-1
and NOR5-4. A combination of the probes NOR5-730
and NOR5-1238 increased the current coverage of the
NOR5/OM60 clade to 92%, without any outgroup hits
(Fig. 2). The combination failed to detect part of
NOR5-1C, NOR5-2, NOR5-10, and all sequences in the
NOR5-12 subclade.
Helper oligonucleotides were designed for all the
above probes in an attempt to improve their
hybridization efﬁciency (Table 1) [21]. Helpers are
unlabeled oligonucleotides that bind in the vicinity of
the probe, thereby presumably opening the secondary
structure of the rRNA. The application of two
helpers per probe signiﬁcantly increased the intensity
of monolabeled and CARD-FISH signals. Fixed
cells of Congregibacter litoralis KT71 were used to
determine the optimal formamide concentration for
hybridization of probes NOR5-730 and NOR-1238 as
50%. These two probes were subsequently used at this
formamide concentration in combination with helpers
NOR5-659h, NOR5-709h, NOR5-1217h and NOR51287h for a speciﬁc and sensitive identiﬁcation of
members of the NOR5/OM60 clade in environmental
samples.

Quantiﬁcation of members of the NOR5/OM60
clade by CARD-FISH
The cells detected by CARD-FISH with the probe
mixture NOR5-730/NOR5-1238 in marine plankton
and benthos samples were pleomorphic (Fig. 4), often
from coccoid to rod-shaped, sometimes were also bent

in a vibrio shape. The length of the cells was between 0.5
and 3 mm, with a diameter between 0.5 and 1 mm. In
plankton samples, single cells were mostly detected,
suggesting that they were free-living. However, as
described before [22] cells were also detected that were
attached to microaggregates. In sediment samples, cells
detected as NOR5/OM60 were also arranged in rosettes
(Fig. 4f).
The optimized NOR5-730/NOR5-1238 probe/helper
mixture was subsequently used for CARD-FISH-based
quantiﬁcations in various marine samples. In
the brackish to marine Yangtze River estuary
(salinities of 22–32 psu), between 0% and 2.3%
of all DAPI-stained cells were detected. Absolute
numbers went up to 1.2  105 cells ml1 (Table 4).
No NOR5/OM60 cells were detected further up
the Yangtze River at a freshwater reference site with
0.2 psu salinity.
Counts in surface waters obtained during an openocean North Atlantic transect in September 2006
(Vision cruise) were between 0.1% and 0.5%
(3  103–1  104 cells ml1). NOR5/OM60 cells were
present in all the samples, with no obvious trend from
high to low latitude. The counts were only higher, at
0.9%, in a coastal sample taken during the same cruise
off Iceland (SI Table 1).
In a transect in the Namibian coastal upwelling region
along 23.001S, the NOR5/OM60 counts at depths
10–15 m decreased with ﬂuctuation from 3.0%
(2.0  105 cells ml1) near the coast to 0.5%
(1.3  104 cells ml1) in the open ocean (Fig. 5). Three
depth proﬁles made at coastal (14.361E), mid-shelf
(13.151E) and open-ocean stations (12.001E) all clearly
showed a steep decrease of the NOR5/OM60 abundances with depth. Below 70 m, the counts became
marginal (o0.05%), and NOR5/OM60 cells were not
detected below 300 m. With a number of
3.3  105 cells ml1 (3.3% of DAPI) the counts were
highest at the station closest to the coast (14.361E) at a
water depth of 5 m.
The highest relative abundance of NOR5/OM60
cells encountered in this study was recorded near
the North Sea island Helgoland at station ‘‘Kabeltonne’’
(54.181N 7.901E). In surface water samples
retrieved during May–July 2007, which were preﬁltered
through a 10 mm ﬁlter, members of the NOR5/OM60
clade ranged from 1.7% to 6.6% (8.2  103–
1.2  105 cells ml1).
Counts were also high in sandy intertidal sediments
taken at Janssand (53.721N, 7.681E), in the back-barrier
region of the island of Spiekeroog close to the German
North Sea coast. At this sample point, a range of
2.5–4.0% was detected in the top 3 cm of the sediment,
and 1.4–3.1% at a depth of 3–12 cm (Fig. 6). Counts in
March 2007 were generally lower than in August. The
absolute number of NOR5/OM60 was in the order of

Further quantiﬁcations of the NOR5/OM60
clade, either from this study or from former studies,
are summarized in Table 3. A few preliminary
quantiﬁcations of NOR5/OM60 in freshwater samples

Discussion
The interest in the NOR5/OM60 clade has signiﬁcantly increased with the discovery that this clade
encompasses the elusive marine gammaproteobacterial
branch of AAnPs [12,22]. The data obtained in this
study clearly support the hypothesis of a cosmopolitan

distribution of the NOR5/OM60 clade in marine surface
waters. The presence of NOR5/OM60 is now conﬁrmed
for all oceans except the Indian Ocean, which has still
not yet been examined in this regard. Several lines of
evidence suggest that members of the NOR5/OM60
clade are generally more abundant in coastal areas than
in open-ocean settings. CARD-FISH counts in coastal
surface waters (N ¼ 30) showed an average of
2.171.5%, whereas open-ocean surface water samples
(N ¼ 36) had an average of 0.570.4%. Fully independent support for this ﬁnding comes from the GOS
dataset [52] in which the frequency of NOR5/OM60 16S
rRNA gene sequences was signiﬁcantly higher in coastal
stations (1.4%) than in open-ocean stations (0.3%).
Nevertheless, these data cannot be directly translated
into cell frequencies since the number of rRNA operons
per genome is quite different in marine bacteria [31]. The
two fully sequenced strains of the NOR5/OM60 clade,
‘‘Congregibacter litoralis’’ KT71 and HTCC2080 contain two and one ribosomal operon, respectively. When
the copy number of the NOR5/OM60 group members is
less than the average, the frequency of 16S rRNA genes
in the metagenomic library might underestimate the
relative abundance of cells, and vice versa.
Our large CARD-FISH dataset also provides convincing support for a preference of members of the
NOR5/OM60 clade for the euphotic zone, which had
been reported for the coastal Paciﬁc Newport Hydroline
station [12]. Once again, support for this conspicuous
depth distribution comes from metagenomics. In fosmid
libraries constructed from bacterioplankton samples
at Aloha Station, Hawaii, 16S rRNA genes of the
NOR5/OM60 clade were detected at depths of 10 m and
70 m, but not at 130 m or deeper [17]. However, since the
absence of NOR5/OM60 sequences is not valid proof of
their absence per se, other methods, such as quantitative
PCR, need to be applied to quantify NOR5/OM60 in
these deep water layers.
There are indications for strong seasonal ﬂuctuation
of the NOR5/OM60 abundance in coastal waters. Three

135

studies on North Sea surface water had reported
NOR5/OM60 blooms up to 13% co-occurring with,
for example, a dinoﬂagellate bloom [7,19,48]. Similar
observations were recently reported for northwest
Mediterranean coastal waters [3]. In our study, the
samples from Xiamen, Barcelona and Helgoland
showed the same trend, with high counts of
NOR5/OM60 co-occurring with algal blooms. The
photoheterotrophic members of the NOR5/OM60 clade
beneﬁt from algal photosynthesis, yet it is too early to
speculate on a speciﬁc link to particular algal species.
We hope that the more sensitive and speciﬁc probes and
protocols developed in this study will facilitate more
detailed investigations on the seasonality of NOR5/
OM60 abundance in the future.
Besides season, water depth, and distance to the coast,
we also searched for other parameters that might
inﬂuence the distribution of NOR5/OM60 in the water
column. Consequently, linear regression analysis was
used to check for correlation between NOR5/OM60
abundance and other parameters. In the Namibian
transect, NOR5/OM60 abundance was highly correlated
to turbidity (r2 ¼ 0.79) (Fig. 7a). The NOR5/OM60
isolate Congregibacter litoralis KT71 is known to form
aggregates in pure culture. Also, in situ attachment of
NOR5/OM60 cells to aggregates has been demonstrated
before [22]. NOR5/OM60 was positively correlated
to chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (r2 ¼ 0.73) (Fig. 7b).
Similarly, in the surface waters of the Yangtze River
estuary, the NOR5/OM60 abundance showed a strong
positive correlation with chlorophyll concentration
(r2 ¼ 0.74) (Fig. 7c). Algae are a source of fresh organic
material, which in turn could serve as a substrate for
NOR5/OM60. Indeed, the cultured strain KT71 prefers
short oligomers and amino acids as substrates [22],
which are generally rapidly consumed in the water
column [63]. So, it might be advantageous to stay close
to the site of production of these substrates. No other
signiﬁcant correlation of NOR5/OM60 abundance was
detected with temperature, salinity or total bacterio-

plankton cell counts at either site. Also, during the
North Atlantic Vision cruise, the NOR5/OM60 proportion in the surface water (10 m) showed no obvious
correlation with any detected parameters (latitude,
temperature, total DAPI cell count or chlorophyll
ﬂuorescence).
The NOR5/OM60 group and the AAnPs showed
some common features for distribution, at least in some
regions: they both occurred at a higher percentage in
coastal water compared to the open ocean, and they
were more abundant in summer or autumn than in
winter or spring. Most of them appear in the
euphotic zone in the marine water column and they
are positively related to high chlorophyll concentrations
[15,30,53,56,62]. It seems that many members of
NOR5/OM60 may indeed be AAnPs. However, considering the rather high 16S rRNA sequence diversity
within the NOR5/OM60 clade and its broad habitat
range, it cannot be taken for granted that all members of
NOR5/OM60 are AAnPs. The four strains isolated from
marine surface waters KT71 (NOR5-3), HTCC2080
(NOR5-1B), HTCC2246 (not grouped) and HTCC2148
(NOR5-8) were shown to contain genes pufL and pufM
coding for light-harvesting complex I (LHC I). However, pufL and pufM trees lacked congruence with the
16S rRNA phylogeny [12]. The pufM gene of
HTCC2080 belongs to pufM Group K, the sister group
of KT71, while the pufL and pufM genes of the
HTCC2246 and HTCC2148 groups belong to different
clusters of Alphaproteobacteria [62]. This suggests that
the loss and gain of photosynthesis operons might be
quite frequent in the NOR5/OM60 clade. For bacteria
with a dominantly heterotrophic metabolism, photosynthesis might just be an accessory energy source
that may not be required by all members of the
NOR5/OM60 clade. Further studies that might combine
the in situ identiﬁcation of NOR5/OM60 cells by
CARD-FISH with the direct identiﬁcation of AAnP
using infrared ﬂuorescence microscopy [29,53] are
therefore needed. Only then could we directly determine
how many NOR5/OM60 are AAnPs, and, vice versa,
how many of the AAnP are NOR5/OM60. In this
respect, Yutin and colleagues [62] have recently reported
on compositional changes within the AAnP between
coastal and open-ocean sites. They have assessed the
diversity of marine AAnPs based on comparative
analysis of pufM sequences retrieved from the metagenomic libraries of the GOS [52]. Only six out of 85
scaffolds identiﬁed to include pufM in the oxic samples
of the GOS dataset were highly similar to the pufM of
Congregibacter litoralis KT71 and therefore likely to be
from the NOR5/OM60 clade. These were from coastal
samples, whereas the pufM of the alphaproteobacterial
Roseobacter-type was found throughout the samples,
and, additionally, as yet unidentiﬁed groups of AAnP
seemed to dominate pelagic marine waters [62].

Abstract
Background: Aerobic gammaproteobacteria affiliated to the OM60/NOR5 clade are widespread in saline
environments and of ecological importance in several marine ecosystems, especially the euphotic zone of coastal
areas. Within this group a close relationship between aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophs and non-phototrophic
members has been found.
Results: Several strains of aerobic red-pigmented bacteria affiliated to the OM60/NOR5 clade were obtained from
tidal flat sediment samples at the island of Sylt (North Sea, Germany). Two of the novel isolates, Rap1red and Ivo14T,
were chosen for an analysis in detail. Strain Rap1red shared a 16S rRNA sequence identity of 99% with the type
strain of Congregibacter litoralis and was genome-sequenced to reveal the extent of genetic microheterogeneity
among closely related strains within this clade. In addition, a draft genome sequence was obtained from the isolate
Ivo14T, which belongs to the environmental important NOR5-1 lineage that contains so far no cultured
representative with a comprehensive description. Strain Ivo14T was characterized using a polyphasic approach and
compared with other red-pigmented members of the OM60/NOR5 clade, including Congregibacter litoralis DSM
17192T, Haliea rubra DSM 19751T and Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T. All analyzed strains contained
bacteriochlorophyll a and spirilloxanthin as photosynthetic pigments. Besides a detailed phenotypic characterization
including physiological and chemotaxonomic traits, sequence information based on protein-coding genes and a
comparison of draft genome data sets were used to identify possible features characteristic for distinct taxa within
this clade.

Conclusions: Comparative sequence analyses of the pufLM genes of genome-sequenced representatives of the
OM60/NOR5 clade indicated that the photosynthetic apparatus of these species was derived from a common
ancestor and not acquired by multiple horizontal gene transfer from phylogenetically distant species. An affiliation
of the characterized bacteriochlorophyll a-containing strains to different genera was indicated by significant
phenotypic differences and pufLM nucleotide sequence identity values below 82%. The revealed high genotypic
and phenotypic diversity of closely related strains within this phylogenetic group reflects a rapid evolution and
frequent niche separation in the OM60/NOR5 clade, which is possibly driven by the necessities of an adaptation to
oligotrophic marine habitats.

Background
Aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic bacteria use
light as additional energy source for mixotrophic growth
and play a significant role in the microbial ecology of
marine environments [1,2]. Members of this physiological group belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria have
been intensively studied (for review see e.g. [3,4]), but so
far little is known on the phenotypic diversity of representatives belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria. The
existence of aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic
gammaproteobacteria in marine environments was first
postulated in a study by Béjà et al. [5], who could identify photosynthesis genes in partial genome sequences of
gammaproteobacteria retrieved from seawater off the
coast of California (USA). A few years later the two marine isolates HTCC2080 and KT71T were independently
identified as aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic
gammaproteobacteria by proteomic analyses [6] and
genome sequencing [7], respectively. Strain KT71T was
subsequently characterized in detail and described as
Congregibacter litoralis (C. litoralis) by Spring et al. [8],
thereby representing the first photoheterotrophic bacterium of this group with a validly published name. Phylogenetically, C. litoralis is affiliated to a large coherent
cluster of 16S rRNA gene sequences, which were mainly
retrieved by cultivation-independent methods from
marine habitats around the world. This sequence cluster was recognized as a distinct lineage within the
class Gammaproteobacteria and designated as OM60
[9,10] or NOR5 clade [11]. Metabolic active bacteria
representing this clade could be detected in numerous
environmental samples by using fluorescence in situ
hybridization experiments [12,13]. Based on these findings it is assumed that the OM60/NOR5 clade of
Gammaproteobacteria is of significant ecological importance due to its widespread occurrence in the euphotic zone of saline ecosystems and high abundance
especially in coastal waters [6,13,14]. A phylogenetic
lineage closely related to the OM60/NOR5 cluster was
originally defined by a 16S rRNA gene sequence

retrieved from deep sea sediment and designated BD1-7
[13]. In recent years reports about the isolation of additional strains belonging to the OM60/NOR5 group have
accumulated. Some of these strains were described as
mixotrophs containing photosynthetic pigments [6,15]
or proteorhodopsin (PR) [16]. In contrast, no photosynthetic pigments were reported in members of the genus
Haliea [17-19] or Halioglobus [20]. The recently described non-pigmented species Dasania marina [21]
and “Oceanicoccus sagamiensis” [22] are most likely affiliated to the BD1-7 lineage, whereas representatives of
the more distantly related genera Spongiibacter [23] and
Zhongshania [24] form a third phylogenetic branch. In
this study, a comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic
characterization of the novel isolate Ivo14T was
performed that allowed a detailed comparison to other
bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a-containing members of the
OM60/NOR5 clade, so that a profound knowledge of
the metabolic plasticity and taxonomic relationships encountered in this ecologically important group of marine
gammaproteobacteria could be obtained.

Results and discussion
Isolation and identification of mixotrophic representatives
of the OM60/NOR5 clade

An isolation strategy originally designed for the retrieval
of strains belonging to the genus Rhodopirellula within
the Planctomycetales resulted in the isolation of numerous representatives of the OM60/NOR5 clade of marine
gammaproteobacteria [13,25]. The isolation strategy included the use of antibiotics and a screening of redpigmented strains, so that all retrieved OM60/NOR5
isolates were pigmented. Strains belonging to this phylogenetic group represented about 10% of all redpigmented colonies and could be affiliated either to the
NOR5-3 or NOR5-1 lineage within this clade based on
analyses of their 16S rRNA gene sequences [13]. Strains
belonging to the OM60/NOR5 clade were further examined for the presence of pufL and pufM genes encoding
proteins of the photosynthetic reaction center. From 18

Spring et al. BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:118
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118

out of 22 isolated strains fragments of pufLM genes could
be amplified by PCR using specific primers. Probably, the
strategy of Winkelmann and Harder [25] was such an effective method for the isolation of mixotrophic members
of the OM60/NOR5 clade, because it selected for
pigmented and slowly growing bacteria adapted to oligotrophic habitats. Two of the isolated strains, Rap1red (=
NOR5-3) and Ivo14T (= NOR5-1BT), representing two different lineages of the OM60/NOR5 clade were selected
for a further analysis using genome sequencing. Strain
Ivo14T representing the highly diverse and environmentally important NOR5-1 lineage was chosen for an additional detailed phenotypic characterization.
Noteworthy, Haliea rubra (H. rubra), which is closely
related to C. litoralis was also reported to form redpigmented colonies on Marine Agar 2216 [18], but in the
original species description the formation of photosynthetic pigments was not reported. To exclude the possibility that a phototrophic phenotype has escaped attention in
described strains of the genus Haliea, type strains belonging to this genus were cultured in SYPHC medium, which
allowed expression of pigments in all photoheterotrophic
strains belonging to the OM60/NOR5 clade tested so far.
In fact, photosynthetic pigments could be extracted from
cells of H. rubra, which showed a pinkish to red pigmentation upon growth in SYPHC medium, whereas no pigments could be extracted from the cream-colored cells of
H. mediterranea and H. salexigens. In order to determine
if additional described strains belonging to this clade have
unrecognized phototrophic capabilities, extracted DNAs
of species that show no visible pigmentation under conditions of laboratory cultivation were used for a PCR screening with specific primers to detect pufLM genes. BChl acontaining species belonging to the OM60/NOR5 clade
were used as positive control. In addition, primers for the
detection of soxB (representative for a periplasmic enzyme
complex oxidizing thiosulfate) and pop (gene encoding the
opsin subunit of proteorhodopsin) were used to identify
alternative potential mixotrophic pathways in described
chemoheterotrophic species of the OM60/NOR5 clade
and neighboring phylogenetic groups. Results obtained
with the pufLM and soxB primers are depicted in the
phylogenetic tree shown in Figure 1. It turned out that the
genomic DNA of all species described as non-pigmented
(H. salexigens, H. mediterranea, “Oceanicoccus sagamiensis”, Dasania marina, Spongiibacter tropicus and
Spongiibacter marinus) was negative in the amplification
of pufLM genes, whereas a PCR product of the correct
size was obtained from all strains supposed to encode
genes for a photosynthetic apparatus, except H. rubra. It
should be noted that application of the published primers
pufLF1 und pufMR1 [5] failed to amplify pufLM genes
from strain Rap1red, so that we designed the primers
pufLF2 und pufMR2, which have a slightly modified

Page 3 of 21

sequence optimized for members of the OM60/NOR5
clade. Application of the latter primer set allowed the
amplification of the pufLM genes of Rap1red and all other
available photoheterotrophic members of the OM60/
NOR5 clade, but not from H. rubra and species described
as non-pigmented. However, the pufLM nucleotide sequence of H. rubra could be finally obtained by the determination of a draft genome sequence (unpublished data).
It turned out that at least two mismatches at the binding
site of the forward primer prevented a successful amplification of the pufL and pufM genes from this species.
It was not possible to amplify genes encoding
proteorhodopsin or the sulfate thiol esterase SoxB from
the non-phototrophic species shown in Figure 1. For the
PCR screening with the proteorhodopsin primer set PR13 [26] we used genomic DNA from Dokdonia sp. PRO95
[27] as well as total DNA isolated from the North Sea as
positive control. However, a proteorhodopsin-positive
control strain belonging to this phylogenetic group was
not available and the pop gene sequence of strain
IMCC3088 revealed some mismatches to the used
proteorhodopsin oligonucleotide primers. Thus, either the
tested strains do not encode pop genes, or the genes are
such different at the primer binding sites that no PCR
amplification was possible.
Phenotypic characterization
Morphology of cells and colonies

Size and shape of cells of the newly isolated strain
Ivo14T were determined upon growth in SYPHC
medium, which was optimal for cultivation of this strain
and the related species C. litoralis, H. rubra and
Chromatocurvus halotolerans. Cells of Ivo14T were non
motile and appeared coccoid or as short straight-to-bent
rods. Occurrence of pleomorphic cells was observed in
all four BChl a-containing strains and depended to some
extent on the composition of the growth medium, which
makes it important to use the same medium for comparison of size and shape. Especially, growth on the
nutrient-rich medium Marine Broth 2216 led in cultures of H. rubra, C. litoralis and Chromatocurvus
halotolerans to cells with irregular shapes, swelling of
cells and accumulation of highly refractile storage compounds, whereas these effects were less pronounced in
cultures of Ivo14T. The storage compound cyanophycin,
which is a characteristic of C. litoralis was not detected
in cells of Ivo14T or Chromatocurvus halotolerans,
which both accumulate polyhydroxyalkanoates in
addition to polyphosphates. The intracellular carbon
storage compound of H. rubra could be distinguished
from cyanophycin or polyhydroxyalkanoates by a positive reaction of the acidified cell extract with the
anthrone reagent, which detects carbohydrates. This indicates most likely the presence of glycogen as reserve

Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree based on almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences showing the position of BChl a-containing strains
within the OM60/NOR5 clade. The dendrogram was reconstructed with a neighbor-joining distance matrix program as implemented in the
ARB package using phylogenetic distances calculated with the algorithm of Jukes and Cantor. No filter or weighting masks were used to
constrain the used positions of the alignment. In addition, trees were reconstructed using the PHYLIP maximum parsimony program of ARB and
the RAxML maximum likelihood program. Bootstrap values (as percentages of 1000 resamplings) are shown in front of each node, if at least with
one reconstruction method a value of 80% or above was obtained. From left to right the numbers indicate results of the neighbor-joining,
maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses. A hyphen indicates that the branch was not obtained with the respective reconstruction
method. Nucleotide sequence accession numbers are given in parentheses. The affiliation of strains to subclades of the OM60/NOR5 group is
based on [13]. The sequence of Alcanivorax borkumensis [GenBank:Y12579] was used as outgroup (not shown). Designations given in red color
indicate that the respective strains produce BChl a and/or encode genes for a photosynthetic apparatus; names in blue indicate the presence of
proteorhodopsin encoding genes. Strains that were tested with specific PCR primers for the presence of pufLM and soxB genes are labeled with

polymer, because a coherent cluster of glycogen synthesis genes was found in the draft genome sequence of H.
rubra DSM 19751T (unpublished data).
Under conditions of carbon starvation, cells of C.
litoralis had a strong tendency to aggregate and to form
flocs in liquid medium. Floc formation in this strain is
promoted probably by the production and excretion of
pili, which can be recognized as meshwork between cells
in transmission electron micrographs of cell aggregates
(Lünsdorf H., personal communication). A similar
phenomenon was reported previously for the oligotrophic marine alphaproteobacterium Candidatus
Pelagibacter ubique [28]. The formation of flocs was also
regularly observed in H. rubra under conditions of nutrient deprivation and occasionally in Chromatocurvus
halotolerans, but totally absent in Ivo14T.
Colonies of Ivo14T appeared on Marine Agar 2216
after an incubation time of approx. 7 days at 28°C and
were dark red, round, concave, smooth and reached a
diameter of 1 mm. In contrast, colonies of C. litoralis
and Chromatocurvus halotolerans reached a diameter of

approx. 2 mm and appeared already after 3 days. Growth
of H. rubra on Marine Agar 2216 was strongly inhibited
compared to SYPHC agar, so that pin point colonies
were only visible after an incubation period of 10 to
14 days. A diffusible brownish pigment produced by
strain Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T was
not observed in the strains Ivo14T, H. rubra DSM
19751T and C. litoralis DSM 17192T.
Photosynthetic apparatus and cytochrome composition

In vivo absorption spectra of pigmented cells of strain
Ivo14T revealed near-infrared peaks at 801 and 871 nm,
indicating presence of a reaction center embedded in a
light-harvesting complex 1 (LH1). No indication of a
peripheral LH2 complex was detected in whole-cells absorption spectra (Figure 2A). The near-infrared band of
the BChl a incorporated in the LH1 complex of Ivo14T
was significantly blue–shifted compared to the related
species Chromatocurvus halotolerans and C. litoralis,
which displayed peaks at 877 and 876 nm in the respective spectra. Interestingly, the whole-cells spectrum of H.

rubra showed a clearly distinct profile with major peaks
at 804 and 821 nm and only a small peak at 871 nm
(Figure 2A). The observed spectrum indicates the presence of a peripheral LH3 complex accompanied by a
small amount of the supposed LH1 complex. Lightharvesting complexes of the LH3 type were first described in the purple non-sulfur bacterium Rhodoblastus
acidophilus incubated under low-light and/or low
temperature conditions [29,30]. To the best of our
knowledge this is the first report of a LH3 complex in
an obligately aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium. In contrast to Rhodoblastus acidophilus the LH3
complex in H. rubra was apparently expressed constitutively, because its formation was independent of variations in illumination (light/darkness) or oxygen

concentration (6 - 21% (v/v) O2 in the headspace gas
atmosphere).
UV/visible spectroscopy of acetone/methanol extracts of
pigmented Ivo14T cells resulted in peaks that are typical
for BChl a (363, 600 and 771 nm) and spirilloxanthin
(465, 495 and 529 nm). Additional pigments were not observed in this strain. Similar results were obtained for
Chromatocurvus halotolerans [31] and H. rubra DSM
19751T (Figure 2B). Thus, the pigment composition of the
photosynthetic apparatus in all obligately aerobic
gammaproteobacteria studied so far seems to be identical
(Table 1). Maximal levels of pigment expression in Ivo14T
were obtained upon incubation in SYMHC medium under
air atmosphere. Abundance of the LH1 complex in living
cells, estimated by determination of A870 nm/A660 nm ratios, reached maximal values of 0.80 to 0.83. This expression level of the LH1 complex corresponded to a
measured BChl a concentration of around 1.2 nmol/mg
cellular dry weight. The obtained results are comparable
to values reported for Chromatocurvus halotolerans [31],
but significantly lower than found in C. litoralis which can
produce up to 3.5 nmol BChl a/mg dry weight under optimal conditions for photoheterotrophic growth [8]. The
highest concentration of photosynthetic pigments was
however found in H. rubra, which could produce up to
4.4 nmol BChl a/mg dry weight.
The dominant cytochrome types in pigmented cells of
the strains Ivo14T, Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM
23344T and H. rubra DSM 19751T grown under fully aerobic conditions were determined by redox difference spectroscopy of extracts from whole cells solubilized with the
detergent N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide (LDAO).
In dithionite-reduced minus ferricyanide-oxidized redox
difference spectra a Soret peak at 421-422 nm and an
alpha peak at 553-554 nm indicates that c-type cytochromes were dominating. Additional b-type cytochromes
could be identified by a shoulder of the Soret band around
434 nm in spectra of cell-free extracts of strain Ivo14T and
Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T, whereas a
shoulder around 445 nm suggests the presence of cytochromes containing heme a in Ivo14T and H. rubra DSM
19751T. A further analysis of the cytochrome composition
in these strains is given in [32].
Growth characteristics

Growth of strain Ivo14T was observed in the range of
pH 7.0 to 9.0 and 12 to 32°C, with an optimum at pH
8.0 and 28°C. The NaCl concentration suitable for
growth was 1 - 9% (w/v), the optimum at 3% (w/v).
These values were quite similar to that of C. litoralis and
H. rubra, but clearly distinct to Chromatocurvus
halotolerans (Table 1), which has a higher temperature
optimum and is more halotolerant probably due to the
adaptation to growth conditions within the microbial

All strains were positive in the utilization of acetate, L-alanine, fumarate, DL-3-hydroxybutyrate, DL-malate, oxaloacetate, pyruvate, succinate, and L-threonine. The
following compounds were not utilized by all tested strains: citrate, ethanol, formate, D-fructose, D-glucose, glycolate, and methanol. Degradation of starch and
gelatin, reduction of nitrate to nitrite and stimulation of growth by thiosulfate were negative in all strains, as well as diagnostic tests for the enzymes
tryptophanase and arginine dihydrolase. Data marked with an asterisk were taken from the literature [18,31]. Published data that disagree with our results are

mats in a hypersaline spring [31]. Under optimal growth
conditions in SYPHC medium the generation time of
strain Ivo14T was 13 h and thus quite long compared to
the related type strains of Chromatocurvus halotolerans,
C. litoralis and H. rubra, which have mean doubling
times of 8.7, 4.5 and 3.4 h, respectively. As a peculiarity
the requirements of Ivo14T for growth in defined
medium were more complex than that of C. litoralis, H.
rubra or Chromatocurvus halotolerans. In respect to
mineral composition Ivo14T required in addition to sodium chloride, magnesium and calcium ions, whereas C.
litoralis required besides NaCl only either Mg2+ or Ca2+.
In addition, there seems to be a requirement for certain
amino acids. In defined media L-histidine was found to
be an essential nutrient for growth of Ivo14T. No growth
was detected below 40 μmol/l L-histidine in the
medium. The growth-stimulating effect was not concentration dependent within the tested range of up to
500 μmol/l. It was also found that L-histidine could be
replaced with either L-threonine or L-aspartate, which
have completely different pathways of biosynthesis.
Interestingly, all three amino acids are common substrates for enzymatic phosphorylation reactions. Consequently, this rather indicates a defect in the global
regulation of amino acid synthesis, e.g. the stringent response [33,34], than an auxotrophy for certain amino
acids. In subsequent experiments a combination of Lhistidine and L-cysteine, each in a concentration of
250 μM, was shown to be optimal for growth and expression of photosynthetic pigments in strain Ivo14T. Lhistidine stimulated also the growth of H. rubra in defined media by shortening the observed lag-phase, but it
was not an essential compound for growth.
There was no difference in the requirement of vitamins among the four related BChl a-containing strains,
which all needed biotin, thiamine and B-12. However,
some variation in the sensitivity to antibiotics was found.
In contrast to C. litoralis, strain Ivo14T was resistant to

cefalotin, but sensitive to bacitracin and doxycycline. H.
rubra and Chromatocurvus halotolerans could be distinguished from the former two strains by their resistance
to imipenem. H. rubra was clearly distinct to all strains,
because it was only sensitive to chloramphenicol, bacitracin and gentamicin in the applied disk diffusion test
encompassing a total of 13 different antibiotics.
Substrate utilization pattern and enzyme activities

The utilization of carbon sources and enzyme activities
were determined for the novel strain Ivo14T and type
strains of the related pigmented species Chromatocurvus
halotolerans and H. rubra. The three strains of BChl acontaining aerobic gammaproteobacteria analyzed in this
study and C. litoralis were markedly different in their
substrate utilization patterns, thus enabling their differentiation (see Table 1 and the species descriptions
below). Distinguishing characteristics of Ivo14T were the
utilization of L-phenylalanine as sole carbon source,
whereas L-glutamate and glutathione could not be used.
On the other hand, Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM
23344T was unique in the inability to use 2-oxoglutarate
and butanol, whereas H. rubra DSM 19751T was the
only strain expressing the enzyme aesculinase (β-glucosidase). The absence of cytochrome c oxidase activity in
Chromatocurvus halotolerans, which was previously postulated as a distinctive trait [31], however could not be
confirmed. Based on the comparison of substrate
utilization patterns it appears that C. litoralis is the
metabolic most versatile species being able to utilize a
variety of sugars, carboxylic acids and alcohols, probably
reflecting frequent changes of the encountered environmental conditions. All four strains were not able to grow
under anaerobic or autotrophic conditions in the light,
thus confirming their definition as aerobic anoxygenic
photoheterotrophic gammaproteobacteria.
It has to be noted that the substrate utilization pattern
obtained for H. rubra DSM 19751T was significantly

different from the one reported previously [18]. The substrates citrate, glucose and lactose could not be utilized
(although reported as positive), whereas the substrates
acetate, alanine, glutamate, glycerol, lactate, propionate,
pyruvate, serine and succinate could be utilized (although reported as negative). In our hands the BIOLOG
assay used by Urios et al. [18] for the physiological
characterization of H. rubra was not satisfactory for
photoheterotrophic members of the OM60/NOR5 clade,
because neither H. rubra DSM 19751T nor C. litoralis
DSM 17192T or Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM
23344T showed a clear response in BIOLOG plates, at
least after an incubation period of 1 - 2 weeks. Thus, it
is possible that the deviant results reported elsewhere
[18] were caused by using an inappropriate analysis
method.

Chemotaxonomy

Unsaturated fatty acids

The DNA G + C contents of the strains Ivo14T and
Rap1red were deduced from the draft genome sequences
as 56.7 and 56.3 mol%, respectively. Both values are close
to the determined DNA G + C content of C. litoralis
(57.7 mol% [8]), but significantly lower than in
Chromatocurvus halotolerans (63 mol% [31]) and H. rubra
(66.1 mol% determined by genome sequence analysis (this
study)). All three strains analyzed in this study possess
ubiquinone 8 (Q8) as predominating respiratory lipoquinone, which is typical for obligately aerobic gammaproteobacteria. However, some differences became apparent in the polar lipid pattern. The composition in C.
litoralis was dominated by phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified phospholipid [8].
The same pattern was found in H. rubra DSM 19751T,
whereas in Ivo14T an unidentified aminophospholipid instead of the phospholipid was detected. The pattern of
Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T was characterized by an aminophospholipid and an unidentified phospolipid in addition to the dominating polar
lipids phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine
(Table 1), so that it could be distinguished from the profiles of Ivo14T, H. rubra and C. litoralis. However, the profile of Chromatocurvus halotolerans did match the polar
lipid patterns of type strains of the chemoheterotrophic
species H. salexigens and H. mediterranea that were
obtained in this study and differed slightly from results
published elsewhere [17,19]. The whole-cell fatty acid patterns of the strains Ivo14T, Chromatocurvus halotolerans
DSM 23344T and H. rubra DSM 19751T were determined
upon growth on Marine Agar 2216 plates. The results
were compared with the cellular fatty acid profiles of the
type strains of C. litoralis and two related chemoheterotrophic Haliea species (Table 2). The fatty acid pattern
of H. rubra DSM 19751T could be distinguished from all
other type strains by the low content of 17:0, 17:1 and 10:0

to different genera. Further analyses of the cellular fatty
acid profiles of the four BChl a-containing strains were
performed upon cultivation in SYPHC liquid medium
with different oxygen concentrations in the head space gas

atmosphere (see Additional file 1). In a previous study it
was found that in C. litoralis the position of the double
bond in the unsaturated fatty acids 16:1 and 18:1 depends
on the oxygen saturation and was shifted from the ω7 to
the ω6 position under conditions of oxygen limitation [8].
It is known that several pathways for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids exist in proteobacteria. An oxygendependent pathway is based on desaturases that introduce
double bonds in membrane-bound fatty acids by oxidation with molecular oxygen. An alternative oxygenindependent pathway introduces double bonds during
elongation of the fatty acid chain [35]. Hence, we propose
that C. litoralis expresses two distinct desaturases for the
fatty acids 16:1 ω7 (Δ9 desaturase, encoded by the proposed gene KT71_07544) and 18:1 ω7 (Δ11 desaturase,
probably encoded by KT71_03222), whereas the ω6 unsaturated fatty acids are produced by an oxygen-independent
pathway. A similar effect could not be detected in the
strains Ivo14T, Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T
and H. rubra DSM 19751T (Additional file 1). While in
the analyzed fatty acid patterns of strain Ivo14T neither
the abundance of the unsaturated fatty acids 18:1 ω7 nor
16:1 ω7 correlated with the oxygen saturation, in
Chromatocurvus halotolerans a decrease of the portion of
18:1 ω7 from 36.6% to 25.8% under conditions of oxygen
limitation was detected, which indicates involvement of an
oxygen-dependent desaturase. However, in this strain the
reduced amount of 18:1 ω7 was not compensated by the
formation of 18:1 ω6. The absence of genes encoding putative desaturases in the Ivo14T draft genome suggests that
this strain relies completely on an oxygen-independent
pathway for the de novo synthesis of unsaturated fatty
acids. Likewise, H. rubra either does not use desaturases
for the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids or the oxygenindependent de novo synthesis leads to the common 18:1
ω7 and 16:1 ω7 fatty acids. It should be noted that fatty
acid desaturases also can have a function in the cellular
defense against oxidative stress. In this way harmful reactive oxygen species are inactivated by the directed oxidation of saturated fatty acid chains within the cytoplasmic
membrane. Thus, strains like C. litoralis DSM 17192T or
Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T may be better
adapted to oxidative stress than Ivo14T, which would explain that the negative effect of light on pigment production is most pronounced in strain Ivo14T [32]. In a recent
study it was shown that in Dinoroseobacter shibae the repression of pigment synthesis is mainly caused by oxidative stress [36].
Phylogeny and evolution of the photosynthetic apparatus

Based on 16S rRNA gene identity values the newly isolated strain Ivo14T is only distantly related to described
type strains of the OM60/NOR5 clade, including
Halioglobus pacificus S1-27T (94.6%), H. rubra

Page 9 of 21

CM41_15aT (94.6%), C. litoralis KT71T (94.6%), H.
mediterranea 7SM29T (94.4%) and Chromatocurvus
halotolerans EG19T (93.7%). On the other hand, strain
Rap1red shows a close phylogenetic relationship with C.
litoralis KT71T (99.0%) and H. rubra CM41_15aT
(96.8%), comprising together the NOR5-3 line of descent. In reconstructed phylogenetic trees based on almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences the genus
Haliea is currently paraphyletic, because H. rubra intermixes with representatives of photoheterotrophic species
belonging to the genera Chromatocurvus and Congregibacter, while it is only distantly related to the type species H. salexigens (Figure 1). The type strains of H. rubra
and C. litoralis share a 16S rRNA sequence identity
value of 97%, which indicates a close phylogenetic relationship. In several reconstructed phylogenetic trees
Chromatocurvus halotolerans is positioned adjacent to
C. litoralis and H. rubra, but this affiliation is not supported by significant bootstrap values (Figure 1). Therefore, Chromatocurvus halotolerans should not be
included in the genus Congregibacter or NOR5-3
lineage, which is in line with the suggestion made in a
previous work [13].
In Figure 3A a phylogenetic tree based on pufLM gene
sequences belonging to several distinct groups of
Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria is shown. In this tree sequences of
Chromatocurvus halotolerans and all genome-sequenced
representatives of the OM60/NOR5 clade form a monophyletic group together with several cloned pufLM gene
sequences retrieved from environmental samples thereby
indicating that the photosynthetic reaction center genes
within this group were derived from a common ancestor. The topology of pufLM gene sequences within the
OM60/NOR5 clade is roughly in accordance with the
phylogeny derived from 16S rRNA gene data, showing
two main branches comprising representatives of the
NOR5-1 and NOR5-3 lineages and a third branch represented by Chromatocurvus halotolerans. Only the clustering of H. rubra with Chromatocurvus halotolerans in
the pufLM based tree represents a discrepancy with the
16S rRNA phylogeny. However, no indications of a horizontal gene transfer of puf genes from distant phylogenetic lineages to members of the OM60/NOR5 clade were
found, which is in line with results obtained with representatives of the order Chromatiales, a group of purple
sulfur bacteria belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria
[37]. This is in contrast to the Alphaproteobacteria and
Betaproteobacteria, in which apparently horizontal gene
transfer of pufL and pufM genes among phototrophic
members has occurred (Figure 3A). One possible explanation for this divergence could be the variable genome
structure in some members of the Alphaproteobacteria,
especially the Roseobacter clade [38]. However, a

subsequent loss of photosynthesis genes or horizontal
transfer of photosynthesis genes within the OM60/NOR5
clade is still possible, thereby explaining the close relationship of phototrophic and non-phototrophic species within
this group. Nevertheless, our results contradict a previous
report postulating a polyphyletic origin of photosynthetic

reaction center genes in members of the OM60/NOR5
clade based on results obtained with the strains
HTCC2148 and HTCC2246 [6]. In the meanwhile, a draft
genome sequence of HTCC2148 has been determined
[39], but pufLM gene fragments identified by PCR in a
previous report [6] were missing. Currently, no genome

Spring et al. BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:118
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118

sequence of strain HTCC2246 is available, but it belongs
like HTCC2148 to the NOR5-8 branch within the OM60/
NOR5 clade, which does not contain any known phototrophic representatives so far (Figure 1). In addition, we
found in our analysis a high similarity of the pufLM genes
of HTCC2246 with the Bradyrhizobium sp. strain S23321
(Figure 3A). Bradyrhizobium species are found in the
rhizosphere of plants where they form root nodules.
Hence, the pufLM genes of strain HTCC2246 must have
been recently transferred from a nitrogen-fixing, soil bacterium forming root-nodules. However, this would be
highly unlikely, because strain HTCC2246 like most other
known members of the OM60/NOR5 clade is a marine
bacterium, which was isolated from the open sea water
and not from soil. Consequently, we speculate that the results reported by Cho et al. [6] may have been caused by a
contamination of the analyzed samples with cells or DNA
of phototrophic alpha- or betaproteobacteria inhabiting
freshwater or soil, but not marine environments.
In terms of evolution, the acquisition of genes for
anoxygenic photosynthesis in aerobic gammaproteobacteria could have occurred in members of the
NOR5-3 lineage, which still contain genes encoding a
peripheral LH2 complex (see Tables 1 and 3) and possess

Page 11 of 21

an intracytoplasmic membrane system [8] which is typically found in facultative anaerobic photosynthetic purple bacteria, but is otherwise quite uncommon in
aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic bacteria [4]. Possibly, a further adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus to the conditions of aerobic marine environments
in members of the NOR5-1 lineage led to a rapid diversification and speciation process in this subclade,
reflected by a high number of microdiverse 16S rRNA
gene sequences retrieved from marine surface waters.
Probably, the optimization of anoxygenic photophosphorylation under aerobic conditions gave representatives of the NOR5-1 lineage a selective advantage, which
enabled them to play a significant role in the euphotic
zone of coastal marine environments. An evolving
specialization to a distinct type of metabolism could be
also reflected in the observed reduction of the genome
size among photoheterotrophic members of the OM60/
NOR5 clade: The genomes of C. litoralis and Rap1red
have an estimated size of 4.3 and 4.2 million base pairs
(Mb), whereas in the strains HTCC2080, Ivo14T and
Himb55, which all belong to the NOR5-1 lineage considerably smaller genome sizes of 3.6, 3.3 and 2.7 Mb, respectively, were found. Previously, it was claimed that

reductive genome evolution in the genera Prochlorococcus and Candidatus Pelagibacter is driven by an
adaptation to the oligotrophic growth conditions in open
ocean waters [40,41].
On the other hand, the known closely related nonphototrophic species do not represent large coherent
clusters of environmental 16S rRNA gene sequences, but
rather belong to lineages comprising 16S rRNA gene sequences that are less frequently found in the environment. Possible reasons could be that they remained
either dependent on nutrient-rich sites for successful
proliferation or are specialized on recalcitrant carbon
sources [42] resulting in a more restricted distribution
and lower frequency in sea water. Furthermore, it can be
concluded that the acquisition of sox (thiosulfate oxidation) or pop (proteorhodopsin) genes had not the same
effect on the diversification and expansion of the respective strains as the acquisition of photosynthesis
genes. No growth stimulating effect was detected upon
supplementation of media with thiosulfate, so that sox
genes in these species may have a different function that
does not correlate with mixotrophy. The situation for
proteorhodopsin is more complicated, because no data
about the effect of light on the growth response of PRharboring strains belonging to the OM60/NOR5 clade
(e.g. IMCC3088) are currently available. However, it can
be assumed that unlike BChl a-dependent photophosphorylation that allows an increase of growth yield by
the utilization of light [8,32], light-driven proton
pumping by membrane-embedded proteorhodopsin does
not have this effect, at least in the marine alpha- and
gammaproteobacteria studied so far [43,44]. According
to current knowledge proteorhodopsin in marine
proteobacteria only helps to survive periods of starvation, i.e. in the absence of a suitable carbon source or essential nutrients like iron or phosphorous, but does not
promote proliferation in cases when the amount of an
available carbon source limits growth [28,45]. This could
also explain, why the proteorhodopsin-containing
alphaproteobacterium Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique is
dominating in extreme oligotrophic nutrient depleted
surface waters in the middle of the oceans [46], whereas
aerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophic gammaproteobacteria prevail in coastal surface waters [14,47,48],
where in most cases the amount of the carbon source is
the growth limiting factor.
A taxonomic framework for the OM60/NOR5 clade based
on phylogenomic data
Delineation of species

An established approach for the delineation of species is
the comparison of whole genome data, for example by
calculating the overall similarity using high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs). The HSP method is implemented in

Page 12 of 21

the Genome-to-Genome Distance Calculator (GGDC),
which infers distances from the comparison of a set of
HSPs using three distinct formulas. The obtained distances can then be transformed to values analogous to
experimentally obtained DNA-DNA similarity values,
which still represent a widely accepted gold standard for
the delineation of species in bacterial taxonomy [49].
According to the GGDC the estimated DNA-DNA similarity value between the two most closely related strains
C. litoralis DSM 17192T and Rap1red was only 19.8% (±
8.1%) and thus clearly below 70%, which is the widely
accepted threshold value for assigning strains to the
same species. The low calculated overall genome similarity is in good agreement with the observed high sequence divergence of protein-coding genes, which
exclude an affiliation of both strains to the same species
despite the high 16S rRNA gene identity value of 99%.
Although, the 16S RNA gene identity value between the
type strains of C. litoralis and H. rubra is only 97%, it is
close to the traditionally used threshold value above
which the affiliation of strains to the same species
should be tested by DNA-DNA similarity experiments
[50]. We determined the level of DNA-DNA relatedness
between C. litoralis and H. rubra in a wet lab DNADNA reassociation experiment. The obtained result was
21.3% (average of two measurements) and hence as
expected below the threshold value of 70%.
Delineation of genera

In bacterial taxonomy the definition of genera is more
complicated than the classification of species, because universal applicable threshold values still do not exist. The
16S rRNA gene identity values observed among cultured
members of the OM60/NOR5 clade range from 91 to 99%
with low divergence values between chemoheterotrophic
and photoheterotrophic representatives. In some phylogenetic groups, like Mycoplasmatales (e.g., [51]) or
Spirochaetales (e.g., [52]) such values are typically found
among members of a single genus, which may be due to
the restricted number of suitable phenotypic traits available for classification among the members of these phylogenetic groups. On the other hand, in families that are
phenotypically well studied, like Chromatiaceae (e.g., [53])
or Enterobacteriaceae [54] the delineation of genera is
often based on 16S rRNA gene divergence values of
around 3% or less. However, the determined significant
phenotypic differences among closely related strains
within the OM60/NOR5 clade indicate that comparative
16S rRNA sequence analyses alone do not allow a reliable
dissection of taxa in this phylogenetic group. In such
cases, comparative sequence analyses of housekeeping
genes is often used as alternative to 16S rRNA gene analyses to obtain a more reliable discrimination of taxa, because protein-coding genes are less conserved in evolution

Spring et al. BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:118
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118

than the 16S rRNA gene, so that a better resolution of
closely related species can be obtained. In addition, a comparison of protein-coding genes avoids the bias of arbitrarily selected phenotypic traits often used for the
characterization of species. Previously, sequences of pufL
and pufM genes encoding subunits of the photosynthetic
reaction center were successfully used to deduce phylogenetic relationships among phototrophic purple sulfur
bacteria (Chromatiales) [37]. It was found that a classification to the genus level is possible based on partial nucleotide sequences of pufL and pufM genes. In that study
pufLM nucleotide sequence identity values below 86% and
81% correlated with membership to different genera in
Chromatiaceae and Ectothiorhodospiraceae, respectively
[37]. Applying the lower threshold value to the OM60/
NOR5 clade, it turns out that only the closely related
strains C. litoralis DSM17192T and Rap1red belong to the
same genus, sharing a pufLM nucleotide sequence identity
value of 82.7%. The pufLM genes of the two strains
H. rubra DSM 19751T [GenBank:KC253226] and
Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T [GenBank:
JX311416] have a sequence identity of 80.7%, but an affiliation of both strains to the same genus would be in
contradiction to phenotypic and 16S rRNA sequence data.
Among all other photoheterotrophic representatives of
this clade the pufLM sequence identity values are in the
range between 69.3 and 76.6% and hence clearly below the
genus level. For instance, the identity level of the pufLM
genes of the two strains Ivo14T and HTCC2080 is only
73.6%, despite a close relationship at the 16S rRNA gene
sequence level (96.1%).
The high divergence values of the pufLM genes could
either indicate a rapid evolution of the photosynthetic
apparatus alone or of the total genome. In order to determine representative levels of genome divergence, we
have selected the housekeeping gene rpoB encoding the
RNA polymerase β-subunit as an additional phylogenetic
marker. It is assumed that the rpoB gene is representative for the total genome and thus can be used for the
delineation of species and genera [55]. Despite some
minor variations depending on the analyzed phylogenetic group, the proposed value for the rpoB gene sequence identity level of strains belonging to the same
species is above 98% and for species of a single genus
above approx. 85% [54,56]. Accordingly, the rpoB nucleotide sequence identity between the strains C. litoralis
DSM 17192T and Rap1red (84.9%) would indicate an affiliation to the same genus, whereas all other values determined among genome sequenced members of the
OM60/NOR5 clade were below 80% (72.2-77.8%), which
is in good agreement with conclusions deduced from the
pufLM sequence identity values. Furthermore, partial
rpoB nucleotide sequences of type strains of the species
H. salexigens [GenBank:JX311417], H. mediterranea

Page 13 of 21

[GenBank:KC253225] and Chromatocurvus halotolerans
[GenBank:JX311416] were determined upon retrieval by
PCR amplification, while a complete rpoB gene sequence
was extracted from the unpublished draft genome of H.
rubra DSM 19751T [GenBank:KC253224]. A comparison
of the determined sequences with the available rpoB data
set revealed that all identity values were below 85%,
except between H. rubra and Chromatocurvus
halotolerans, which share an rpoB gene sequence identity value of 86.5%. This value is unusually high compared to an rpoB sequence identity value of 80.1%
between H. rubra and C. litoralis, which even share a
higher 16S rRNA gene identity of 97.0%. A phylogenetic
diagram based on the partial rpoB nucleotide sequences
(Figure 3B) confirms with high bootstrap support the existence of two main lineages (NOR5-1 and NOR5-3) of
BChl a-containing strains within the OM60/NOR5
clade. The clustering of H. rubra with Chromatocurvus
halotolerans confirms the results obtained by comparison of the pufLM genes, but is in conflict with the 16S
rRNA based phylogenetic tree. Probably, the observed
highly divergent pufLM and rpoB nucleotide sequences
among closely related members of the OM60/NOR5
clade indicate that the genomes of these bacteria
undergo rapid evolution, which may not be reflected in
corresponding changes of the highly conserved 16S
rRNA gene sequences.
With the exception of C. litoralis DSM 17192T and
Ivo14T all other genome sequenced isolates belonging to
the OM60/NOR5 and BD1-7 clades have not yet been
characterized phenotypically in detail. However, distinguishing phenotypic features are still a requirement for the
formal description of novel taxa. Therefore, we analyzed
the available genome data for the presence of genes with a
potential taxonomic significance, i.e. encoding traits that
could be useful for the description of species and genera.
The results of our analyses are shown in Table 3 and it
turned out that both strains Rap1red and C. litoralis DSM
17192T can be distinguished from other members of the
analyzed phylogenetic group based on traits that are not
strain or species specific. Among members of the OM60/
NOR5 clade genes for urease and cyanophycin synthetase
are so far only found in the latter two strains and can
therefore be used for the delineation of the genus
Congregibacter from other BChl a-containing taxa.

Conclusions
In summary, molecular and phenotypic data support the
affiliation of the photoheterotrophic strains Ivo14T,
Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T, H. rubra
DSM 19751T and C. litoralis DSM 17192T to different
genera within the OM60/NOR5 clade. In addition, the
detection of a photosynthetic apparatus in H. rubra suggests its separation from the non-phototrophic genus

Methods
Source of sample and isolation procedure

The general isolation procedure has been already described in a previous report [25], which was however focused mainly on the isolation of Rhodopirellula strains.

Spring et al. BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:118
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118

In brief, the OM60/NOR5 isolates were obtained as follows: In October 2005 sediment samples were collected
from a tidal flat area at Königshafen bay, near the town
of List on the German Island of Sylt. The approx. geographic coordinates of the sampling site were 55.04°
North and 8.42° East. Most samples were obtained from
the top oxic layer of muddy or sandy intertidal sediments. After transportation to the laboratory additional
1:10 and 1:100 dilutions of the original sediment samples
were prepared in artificial seawater, then 50 or 200 μl aliquots of each sample were spread on agar plates of Plarich medium supplemented with the antibiotics ampicillin and cycloheximide added in a concentration of 2.0 g/l
each. The exact composition of Pla-rich medium has
already been described elsewhere [25]; essentially it
is composed of artificial seawater supplemented with
vitamins and trace elements that contains 0.25 g/l each of
yeast extract, peptone and glucose as substrates. Colonies
displaying a pinkish to red-violet pigmentation appeared
after several weeks of incubation at 24°C. Pigmented
colonies were further purified by subsequent transfers on
Pla-rich agar plates without antibiotics. To determine purity and the phylogenetic affiliation of isolated strains the
16S rRNA genes were PCR-amplified from whole cells
and then directly sequenced using an ABI 3130xl DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems; Darmstadt, Germany). A
total of 240 red-pigmented colonies were obtained, of
which 22 could be affiliated to the OM60/NOR5 clade by
phylogenetic analyses of their partial 16S rRNA gene
sequences.
Used strains, media and cultivation conditions

In addition to the newly isolated strains Rap1red and
Ivo14T the following reference strains were taken from the
DSMZ culture collection and used for comparison:
Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM 23344T (= EG19T),
Congregibacter litoralis DSM 17192T (= KT71T), Cronobacter muytjensii DSM 21870T (= ATCC 51329T),
Dasania marina DSM 21967T (= KOPRI 20902T), Haliea
mediterranea DSM 21924T (= 7SM29T), Haliea rubra
DSM 19751T (= CM41_15aT), Haliea salexigens DSM
19537T (= 3x/A02/235T), “Oceanicoccus sagamiensis”
DSM 25275T (= PZ-5T), Spongiibacter marinus DSM
17750T (= HAL40bT) and Spongiibacter tropicus DSM
19543T (= CL-CB221T). Haliea rubra CM41_15aT was deposited in the DSMZ by the Laboratoire Arago, Université
Pierre et Marie Curie (Banyuls-sur-mer, France) under the
conditions of a Material Transfer Agreement. The authenticity of the used strains has been confirmed by the Identification Service of the DSMZ by sequencing of the
respective 16S rRNA genes.
For routine cultivation all strains were grown on Marine Broth or Agar 2216. The BChl a-containing strains
Ivo14T, DSM 17192T, DSM 19751T and DSM 23344T

Page 16 of 21

were also grown in a complex medium that was less
nutrient-rich and more suitable for the expression of
photosynthetic pigments in these strains. It was designated SYPHC medium and has the following composition (per liter demineralized water): 35.00 g sea
salts, 0.10 g NH4Cl, 0.05 g KH2PO4, 2.50 g HEPES
(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid),
1.00 g yeast extract, 1.10 g sodium pyruvate, 0.04 g
L-histidine, 0.04 g L-cysteine-HCl × H2O, 1.00 ml
Wolfe’s mineral elixir (see DSMZ medium 792) [58],
and 1.00 ml vitamins solution (see DSMZ medium
503) [58]. All ingredients were dissolved in water except NH4Cl and KH2PO4, which were added after
autoclaving from a sterile stock solution. The pH of
the medium was adjusted to 7.5 – 7.7 prior to autoclaving. For incubation of cultures in closed serum
vials under defined gas atmospheres the SYPHC
medium was slightly modified: All compounds, except the HEPES buffer which was omitted, were
dissolved in water and then the solution was sparged
with a 80% N2 and 20% CO2 gas mixture for 45 min
to remove dissolved oxygen. Various concentrations
of oxygen in the headspace gas atmosphere were
obtained by filling serum vials with anoxic medium
to certain levels as described previously [8]. The pH
of the medium was adjusted to 7.3 – 7.5 after autoclaving by adding Na2CO3 from a sterile and anoxic stock
solution (5% w/v) that was prepared under a 80% N2
and 20% CO2 gas atmosphere. In some experiments the
sodium pyruvate in SYPHC medium was replaced with
sodium DL-malate and the resulting medium was designated SYMHC or SYM, if the amino acids L-histidine
and L-cysteine were omitted.
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Taufkirchen, Germany) and complex nutrients from
DIFCO BBL (Becton Dickinson; Heidelberg, Germany).
Determination of growth and phenotypic traits

The absorbance values of growing cultures were determined in a Thermo Scientific BioMate 6 split beam UV/
visible spectrophotometer using 1 cm light path disposable cuvettes and water as blank. The A660nm reading
was used to estimate the cell density. Expression of the
light-harvesting complex in strain Ivo14T was estimated
by determining the A870nm to A660nm ratio, whereas for
cultures of C. litoralis and Chromatocurvus halotolerans
a ratio of A880nm to A660nm was used and for H. rubra a
ratio of A820nm to A660nm. The cellular dry weight of
grown cultures was determined by overnight freezedrying of cell pellets harvested by centrifugation. A comparison of the determined cellular dry weights with corresponding absorbance values revealed similar ratios for
the strains Ivo14T, Chromatocurvus halotolerans DSM
23344T and H. rubra DSM 19751T grown in defined

Spring et al. BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:118
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/118

medium with pyruvate as carbon source (0.59, 0.59 and
0.58 mg dry weight per absorbance unit (A) at 660 nm,
respectively). Significantly higher ratios were obtained
upon cultivation of these strains in complex media
containing malate and yeast extract, which may be due
to the storage of reserve polymers. The corresponding
values for strains Ivo14T, DSM 23344T and DSM 19751T
were 0.68, 0.74 and 0.85 mg dry weight per A660nm.
The substrate utilization patterns of strains Ivo14T and
H. rubra DSM 19751T were determined in SYPHC
medium that was modified by omitting yeast extract and
pyruvate. Without additional carbon source no growth
took place in this medium. The defined medium described by Spring et al. [8] for testing carbon source
utilization in C. litoralis was also used to test growth of
Chromatocurvus halotolerans on single carbon sources.
Carbon sources were added in various concentrations
that depended on the approximate size of the respective
molecule: 20 mM (1-2 carbon atoms), 10 mM (3-4 carbon atoms), 5 mM (5-6 carbon atoms), 2.5 mM (7-8 carbon atoms) and 1 mM (>9 carbon atoms). Growth on a
carbon source was verified by measurements of the optical
density in aliquots of the culture in intervals of two or
three days until stationary phase was reached. At least one
subsequent transfer in medium with the same carbon
source was done to exclude a carryover of remaining substrates along with the inoculum in the first transfer. The
growth response on a single carbon source was designated
as negative, if the obtained OD660 value was below 0.05; as
weak, if the maximal OD660 value was between 0.05 and
0.10; and positive, if it was above 0.10.
Sensitivity to antibiotics was determined by disk diffusion assays (Kirby-Bauer method) using the antimicrobial
susceptibility disks offered by Oxoid (Wesel, Germany).
The following antibiotics and concentrations were used:
cephalotin (30 μg), imipenem (10 μg), chloramphenicol
(10 μg), gentamicin (10 μg), neomycin (30 μg), colistin
(10 μg), polymyxin B (300 units), oxacillin (5 μg), tetracycline (30 μg), doxycycline (30 μg), vancomycin (30 μg), lincomycin (15 μg), and bacitracin (10 units).
Characterization of additional morphological traits and
diagnostic tests for enzymes and physiological activities
were carried out as described previously [8]. Carbohydrates as reserve compound were detected in wet cell
pellets by reaction with the anthrone reagent as reported
elsewhere [59]. Tests were performed in duplicate including respective positive and negative controls. Unless
noted otherwise all physiological tests were incubated at
28°C in dim light and at 12% (v/v) oxygen in the head
space gas atmosphere.
Analyses of pigments and cytochromes

Photosynthetic pigments were extracted from wet cell
pellets using a mixture of acetone/methanol (7:2) as

Page 17 of 21

described previously [8]. Spectra were recorded with a
Thermo Scientific BioMate 6 split beam UV/visible spectrophotometer. The concentrations of bacteriopheophytin
a, bacteriochlorophyll a and spirilloxanthin in the acetone/methanol extracts were determined from the absorbance values obtained at 747, 771 and 475 nm, respectively,
using the spectral reconstruction method of van der Rest
and Gingras [60].
The detection and identification of various cytochrome
types was done as reported previously [8].
Chemotaxonomical characterization

Cellular fatty acid patterns were determined from cells
grown to stationary phase in SYPHC liquid medium or
on Marine Agar 2216. The preparation and extraction of
fatty acid methyl esters from biomass and their subsequent separation and identification by gas chromatography was done as described elsewhere [61]. Respiratory
lipoquinone and polar lipid analyses were carried out by
the Identification Service and Dr. B.J. Tindall, DSMZ,
Braunschweig, Germany, according to the protocols
given by the DSMZ Identification Service [62].
Detection of specific genes using PCR

For the isolation of genomic DNA from strain Ivo14T
and further reference strains the MasterPure™ Gram
Positive DNA Purification Kit from Epicentre (Madison,
USA) was used according to the instructions provided
by the manufacturer. Extracted genomic DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer
(Peqlab; Erlangen, Germany).
PCR amplification of genomic DNA was carried out
using the HotMasterMix 2.5x from 5 PRIME (Hamburg,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol or the
Taq DNA polymerase from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) in
reaction buffer containing 200 μM (each) deoxynucleotide
triphosphates (dNTPs), 1 μM (each) oligonucleotide
primers and ca. 10 – 25 ng of genomic DNA in a final volume of 20 μl. PCR products were purified using the
HiYield Gel/PCR clean-up and Gel-Extraction Kit (SLG;
Gauting, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and visualized by gel electrophoresis (1% agarose). Finally, PCR products were sequenced using a BigDye
Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Life Technologies;
Darmstadt, Germany) and an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems; Darmstadt, Germany).
Amplification of pufLM genes

For detection of pufL and pufM genes in extracted DNA a
PCR amplification was performed with two sets of
degenerated primers (see Table 4). Sequences of the primer
set pufLF2/pufMR2 were optimized to match known sequences of BChl a-containing members of the OM60/
NOR5 clade. The amplification comprises the following

The IUPAC nucleotide code is used to indicate wobble positions in degenerate primer sequences. Ta indicates the annealing temperature used in the PCR reaction.

program: an initial step at 98°C for 3 min and then 35 cycles
at 98°C for 15 s, 56°C for 25 s and 72°C for 1.5 min. At the
end a postelongation at 72°C for 10 min was carried out.
Amplification of proteorhodopsin genes

For detection of proteorhodopsin genes in genomic DNA
samples the degenerate primers PR1, PR2, and PR3 (see
Table 4) targeted against most known proteorhodopsin
genes were used to perform a multiplex PCR analysis. The
amplification comprises the following program: an initial
step at 94°C for 1 min and then 35 cycles at 94°C for 10 s,
47°C for 30 s and 68°C for 50 s. At the end a
postelongation at 68°C for 1.5 min was carried out.
Amplification of soxB genes

For detection of the sulfate thiol esterase subunit (SoxB)
of the periplasmic sox enzyme complex the primers
soxB432F-2 and soxB1446B-2 were designed, which are
based on primers proposed previously [63], but with
some modifications to match known soxB gene sequences of representatives belonging to the OM60/
NOR5 clade. For amplification the protocol was carried
out as described for the pufLM primer except that an
annealing temperature of 54°C was used.
Amplification of rpoB genes

Primers used for the amplification of rpoB fragments
with an expected size of around 1000 nucleotides were
designed based on an alignment of complete rpoB sequences of strains belonging to the OM60/NOR5 clade
(Table 4). For amplification the protocol was carried out
as described for the pufLM primers except that an
annealing temperature of 52°C was used.
Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses

As part of the Moore Foundation Microbial Genome Sequencing Project [64] the genomes of Rap1red and

Ivo14T were shotgun sequenced by the J. Craig Venter
Institute (JCVI). Two genomic libraries with insert sizes
of 1 - 4 kb and 10 - 12 kb were made and sequenced
from both ends to provide paired-end reads on ABI
3730xl DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) to approx. 8× coverage. The draft genomes
of Rap1red (= NOR5-3) and Ivo14T (= NOR5-1BT)
are deposited under GenBank accession numbers
ACCX01000000 and ACCY01000000, respectively. A
genome report compliant with the “Minimum Information about a Genome Sequence specification” is available
from the Genomes Online Database [65]. The genome
sequences were all automatically annotated by JCVI.
These sequences were imported into the GenDB gene
annotation system [66,67] and the genes were further
analyzed. Despite the automatic annotations, all the gene
findings in this study were based on manual gene comparison rather than automatic annotation, since in several cases the automated annotation was incorrect. In
order to determine whether a gene has homologs
existing in other genomes, we used the genomic BLAST
tool of the NCBI [68] with the tblastn (search translated
nucleotide database using a protein query) algorithm for
searching.
The Genome-To-Genome Distance Calculator [69]
was used for genome-based species delineation as described [70]. This system calculates DNA-DNA similarity values by comparing the genomes to obtain highscoring segment pairs (HSPs) and inferring distances
from a set of three formulas (1, HSP length/total length;
2, identities/HSP length; 3, identities/total length). Spectroscopic DNA-DNA reassociation experiments were
performed according to the protocol outlined by the
DSMZ Identification Service [62].
Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA, pufLM and
rpoB gene sequences were reconstructed using distance
matrix (neighbor-joining) and parsimony programs

included in the ARB package [71]. Maximum likelihood
trees were reconstructed with the program RAxML (version 7.2.8) using raxmlGUI [72] and the GTRGAMMA
option with 1000 rounds of bootstrap replicates [73].
The dataset of aligned and almost complete 16S rRNA
gene sequences was based on the ARB SILVA database
release 108 (September 2011) [74], whereas DNA sequences of pufL, pufM and rpoB genes were obtained
from GenBank and aligned using the ClustalW algorithm implemented in the ARB package. The generated
alignments of pufLM and rpoB nucleotide sequences in
PHYLIP format are available as Additional file 2 and
Additional file 3, respectively. Identity values of aligned
nucleotide sequences were determined by using the
similarity option of the neighbor-joining program included in the ARB package.

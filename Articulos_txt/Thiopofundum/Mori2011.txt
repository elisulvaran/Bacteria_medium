A novel mesophilic, facultatively anaerobic, sulfur-oxidizing bacterial strain, designated gps61T,
was isolated from a surface rock sample collected from the hydrothermal field of Suiyo Seamount
on the Izu-Bonin Arc in the Western Pacific Ocean. Cells of the isolate were rod-shaped with a
single sheathed polar flagellum. Neither extensive internal membranes nor storage materials were
present in the cells. In a 20 % CO2 atmosphere, strain gps61T grew using thiosulfate, sulfur or
tetrathionate as electron donors and oxygen or nitrate as electron acceptors. Other substrates,
including organic acids and sugars, did not support growth, indicating that strain gps61T was an
obligate chemolithoautotroph. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain gps61T was
closely related to Thioprofundum lithotrophicum 106T (98.5 % sequence similarity) in the order
Chromatiales. Phylogenetic trees grouped strain gps61T and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum in
the same cluster along with Thioalkalispira microaerophila and Thiohalophilus thiocyanoxidans,
but it was apparent from the analysis that the novel strain had definitely departed from the family
lineage. On the basis of its phylogenetic position along with its morphological and physiological
characteristics, strain gps61T (5NBRC 101261T 5DSM 18546T) represents a novel species of
the genus Thioprofundum, for which the name Thioprofundum hispidum sp. nov. is proposed. In
addition, we propose a novel family name, Thioalkalispiraceae, in the order Chromatiales, to
accommodate the genera Thioalkalispira, Thiohalophilus and Thioprofundum.

Hydrothermal vents have been discovered worldwide and
host peculiar ecosystems that include chemolithoautotrophs
as primary producers. Culture-independent analyses, based
on 16S rRNA gene sequences, have revealed that various
micro-organisms inhabit such environments (Corre et al.,
2001; Marteinsson et al., 1995; Takai & Horikoshi, 1999;
Takai et al., 2001, 2003). To date, novel chemolithoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the phyla
The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene
sequence of strain gps61T is AB266389.

Aquificae and Proteobacteria have been found in hydrothermal vent systems. The class Gammaproteobacteria
contains many environmental strains derived from symbiotic
bacteria associated with invertebrates living in hydrothermal
vents and cold-seep systems. Such symbionts are considered
to be sulfur- or methane-oxidizing bacteria that supply
energy to their host invertebrates (Cavanaugh et al., 1981; Di
Meo et al., 2000; Distel et al., 1994; Felbeck, 1981; Feldman
et al., 1997). In addition, several environmental strains
belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria have been
retrieved from hydrothermal fields, cold-seep sediments
and marine crusts (Arakawa et al., 2006; Inagaki et al., 2004;
Li et al., 1999; Santelli et al., 2008), some of which have been

suggested as having sulfur-oxidizing metabolism (Hirayama
et al., 2007; Sunamura et al., 2004). As for cultivated
Gammaproteobacteria, some species of the genera Halothiobacillus and Thiomicrospira have been isolated from these
environments (Brinkhoff et al., 1999; Sievert et al., 2000;
Takai et al., 2004).
Some previously uncharacterized bacterial strains from
culture-independent analyses have been identified as
possible sulfur-oxidizers belonging to the order Chromatiales of the class Gammaproteobacteria. At the time of
writing, the order Chromatiales included three families,
namely, Chromatiaceae, Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Halothiobacillaceae. Almost all members of these families are
known to oxidize sulfur compounds, although there are
some exceptions. Species belonging to the families Chromatiaceae and Ectothiorhodospiraceae are mainly anoxygenic photolithoautotrophic bacteria, which are able to
oxidize sulfur compounds under anaerobic conditions by
using light (Imhoff, 2005a, b). On the other hand, the
family Halothiobacillaceae contains non-photosynthetic,
chemolithoautotrophic, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria isolated
from hypersaline, marine and terrestrial environments
containing hydrothermal vent systems; its members can
oxidize sulfur compounds under aerobic conditions
(Durand et al., 1993; Ito et al., 2005; Mori & Suzuki,
2008; Sievert et al., 2000). In this study, a group of
previously uncharacterized bacterial strains found in
hydrothermal fields and cold-seep sediments were found
to be phylogenetically distant from the above families but
formed a distinct clade within the order Chromatiales. This
suggested that the creation of a new family was necessary to
encompass these strains. To our knowledge, no such taxon
has previously been proposed despite the fact that these
isolates are clearly separate from recognized families
(Sorokin et al., 2007; Takai et al., 2009). This is likely to
be because of the highly complex nature of higher taxa in
the class Gammaproteobacteria.
In this study, an obligately chemolithoautotrophic, sulfuroxidizing bacterium, designated strain gps61T, was isolated
from a rock sample collected from the hydrothermal field
on Suiyo Seamount. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence
analysis, the isolate belonged to the genus Thioprofundum
of the order Chromatiales. Data from phylogenetic and
phenotypic analyses suggested that strain gps61T warrants
classification as a novel species. On the basis of our
phylogenetic analysis, it is also proposed that a new family
be created to encompass the novel strain and its closest
relatives.
Strain gps61T was isolated from Suiyo Seamount, located
in the Izu-Bonin Arc in the Western Pacific Ocean (28u 349
N 140u 399 E). The region has a submarine caldera with
numerous hydrothermal vents at a depth of 1390 m
(Glasby et al., 2000). Rock samples were collected from
the site, from July 19–23, 2002, using the benthic multicoring system (BMS; Metal Mining Agency of Japan), a
tethered marine rock drill, to obtain cores from under the
http://ijs.sgmjournals.org

seafloor. The rock core samples were collected near the
black smoker hydrothermal vents (~300 uC). For microbial
cultivation, surface layers of the rock core were selected,
crushed immediately with a vice in an anaerobic chamber
(COY Laboratory Products) and resuspended in basal
medium under an N2/CO2 (4 : 1, v/v) atmosphere. The
basal medium was composed of (l21) 0.60 g KH2PO4,
0.11 g K2HPO4, 3.05 g MgCl2 . 6H2O, 0.15 g CaCl2 . 2H2O,
0.66 g (NH4)2SO4, 30 g NaCl, 2.52 g NaHCO3, and 2 ml
each of trace element and vitamin solutions of NBRC
medium 377 (NBRC, 2010). For the enrichment of sulfuroxidizing micro-organisms, AP8SO1 medium, comprising
basal medium supplemented with 5 mM Na2S2O3, was
used under an atmosphere of N2/CO2/O2 (75 : 20 : 5, v/v/v;
150 kPa) in a vial sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and an
aluminium cap; the enrichment was performed at 50 uC.
After incubation for 1 week, thiosulfate was partly
converted into elemental sulfur in the enrichment culture.
The presence of elemental sulfur was determined during
each transfer to fresh AP8SO1 medium and rod-shaped
micro-organisms were observed in the culture using a light
microscope (Olympus model AX70). These phenomena
suggested that the small, but significant, production of
elemental sulfur was due to biotic oxidation of thiosulfate
by the rod-shaped micro-organisms present in the vials.
Sulfur precipitation was observed in an enrichment culture
incubated at 37 uC using AP8SO1 medium supplemented
with 20 mM Na2S2O3 (AP8SO2) under an atmosphere of
N2/CO2/O2 (60 : 20 : 20, 150 kPa). These culture conditions
were used for the isolation of the thiosulfate-oxidizer by
serial dilution. After multiple dilutions, incubation and
transfer of the culture, a micro-organism exhibiting
oxidation of sulfur compounds was successfully isolated
as a pure culture and was designated strain gps61T. The
purity of the isolate was verified by microscopic observation, inoculation into media containing various heterotrophic substrates and determination of the 16S rRNA gene
sequence, which was amplified using various primer sets
(Mori & Suzuki, 2008).
Cells of strain gps61T were rod-shaped, ~0.361.5–2.0 mm,
and had single sheathed polar flagella (Fig. 1); however,
motility was not observed under any growth conditions
tested. Observation using electron microscopy revealed
that the cells had neither storage compounds nor extensive
internal membranes. Gram-staining was negative and
oxidase and catalase activities (Tamaki et al., 2003) were
positive and negative, respectively.
Fatty acid methyl ester analysis was performed using the
GC/MS method (Hanada et al., 2002) and the MIDI
microbial identification system. The major cellular fatty
acids were C16 : 0 (50 % of the total fatty acids) and
branched C17 : 0 (29 %). The branched C17 : 0 could be
distinguished from both the iso- and anteiso-branched
fatty acids, although the binding position of the methyl
group could not be precisely determined. The strain also
contained C16 : 1v7c (16 %), C18 : 1v7c (6 %), C15 : 0 (5 %)
and C14 : 0 (2 %) as minor fatty acid components. The

substitute for oxygen was tested by microscopic observation after 1 week of cultivation at 37 uC. Under anaerobic
conditions (N2/CO2, 80 : 20, v/v; 150 kPa), strain gps61T
was able to use nitrate (10 mM) as an electron acceptor in
the presence of thiosulfate or elemental sulfur. Nitrite was
not detected in the culture on nitrate using a colorimetric
assay (Hewitt & Nicholas, 1964). The following electron
acceptors (mM) were not used, even in the presence of
thiosulfate or elemental sulfur: nitrite (2.5 and 5), fumarate
(10), iron(III) citrate (5) (Heising et al., 1999), manganese
(5), selenate (2.5 and 5), selenite (2.5 and 5) and arsenate
(2.5 and 5). In the presence of thiosulfate under an
atmosphere of N2/CO2 (80 : 20, v/v; 150 kPa), exposure to
light from a halogen lamp did not induce growth of strain
gps61T; therefore, the isolate was not capable of anoxygenic
photosynthesis. Because strain gps61T was unable to use
electron donors other than thiosulfate, elemental sulfur
and tetrathionate, strain gps61T was considered to be an
obligate chemolithoautotroph that uses sulfur oxidation
and carbon dioxide fixation.

and ultrathin section of strain gps61T observed with a transmission
electron microscope (model H-7600; Hitachi) (d). The cells have a
single thick polar flagellum (~20 nm in diameter) and a concealing
core was observed at the tip. Bars, 5 mm (a), 0.5 mm (b, d) and 100

genomic DNA G+C content (Mori et al., 2000) of strain
gps61T was 62.9 mol%. An isoprenoid quinone was
extracted from the cells according to the protocol outlined
by Nakagawa & Yamasato (1993) and analysed using an
LCMS-QP 8000 alpha spectrometer (Shimadzu). The
isolate contained menaquinone but we were unable to
determine the isoprenoid side chain length due to the low
extraction amount.
Utilization of electron acceptors and donors was determined by measuring OD660 (spectrophotometer model U2800; Hitachi), thiosulfate and sulfate concentration
(HPLC model 2695 with conductivity detector model 432
and IC-Pak Anion column; Waters) (Mori et al., 2008) and
cell density via microscopic observation. Strain gps61T
grew using thiosulfate, elemental sulfur and tetrathionate
as sole electron donors. However, the following substrates
did not support growth (mM): sulfide (2 and 5), CH4, H2,
H2+acetate (10), methanol (2 and 5), formate (10 and 30),
acetate (10 and 30), butyrate (10), citrate (10), fumarate
(10), glutamate (10), lactate (10), pyruvate (10), malate
(10), succinate (10), L-arginine (10), L-asparagine (10), Lcysteine (10), L-histidine (10), L-leucine (10), L-methionine
(10), arabinose (5), fructose (5), galactose (5), glucose (5),
inositol (5), mannose (5), raffinose (5), sucrose (5) and
xylose (10). The utilization of electron acceptors as a

Temperature and pH ranges for growth were determined
using a temperature gradient incubator (model TN-2612;
ADVANTEC). The pH of the AP8SO2 medium was
adjusted by the addition of 10 % (w/v) Na2CO3 or 0.2 M
HCl. The temperature range for growth of strain gps61T
was 29–43 uC (optimum 39 uC). Although slight growth
was observed at 50 uC during the first enrichment process,
microbial activity was not detected at that temperature.
The initial pH range for growth at 37 uC was pH 6–8
(optimum pH 7). The NaCl concentration for growth
ranged from 1–4 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 2 %).
Cell density and concentration of thiosulfate and sulfate
over time on either thiosulfate or elemental sulfur were
determined (Supplementary Fig. S1, available in IJSEM
Online). The maximum cell numbers of strain gps61T
grown on thiosulfate and elemental sulfur were almost
identical (8.706106 and 7.776106 cells ml21, respectively). The doubling times on thiosulfate and elemental
sulfur were 14.9 and 26.2 h, respectively. Cells grown on
thiosulfate converted 13.3 mM thiosulfate into 19.2 mM
sulfate and an undetermined amount of elemental sulfur.
The nearly complete sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of
strain gps61T was determined following methods described
previously (Hattori et al., 2000). After alignment of
sequences using the ARB program (Ludwig et al., 2004),
phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using three methods:
the neighbour-joining method using the CLUSTAL_X program (Saitou & Nei, 1987; Thompson et al., 1997), the
maximum-likelihood method with the NucML program in
the MOLPHY software package (Adachi & Hasegawa, 1995;
Hasegawa et al., 1985; Mori et al., 2003) and the
maximum-parsimony method in PAUP version 4 using
parameters as described previously (Mori et al., 2003).
Environmental clone sequences were used for analysis after
screens for chimeras were performed using the Mallard
program (Ashelford et al., 2006). The phylogenetic analyses

indicated that strain gps61T was a member of the genus
Thioprofundum (Takai et al., 2009) in the order Chromatiales
in the class Gammaproteobacteria (Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Fig. S2). The sequence similarity between strain gps61T and
its closest neighbour, Thioprofundum lithotrophicum, was
98.5 %. Furthermore, the isolate was closely related to
environmental clone sequences (92.1–95.6 %) and uncharacterized marine denitrifying sulfur-oxidizing isolates found
in hydrothermal systems such as strains OAII2 and NDII.1
(96.3 % and 93.6 %, respectively) (Meyer et al., 2007).
Thioalkalispira microaerophila and Thiohalophilus thiocyanoxidans were members of the same cluster albeit with
somewhat lower similarity to the Thioprofundum strains
(~93–94 %). This cluster was recovered in all phylogenetic
trees reconstructed using different analytical methods,
despite the fact that the bootstrap score at the node obtained
from the neighbour-joining method was not particularly
high. The phylogenetic analyses also suggested that the
cluster, which included gps61T, should be separated from
the environmental clone cluster that included invertebrate
symbionts. The genera Nitrosococcus and Rheinheimera were
obviously separated from the families of the order

Chromatiales in our analyses (Supplementary Fig. S2),
which suggests the need for reclassification of this group.
Characteristics of strain gps61T and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum are summarized in Table 1. Thioprofundum
lithotrophicum is a moderately thermophilic, piezophilic,
sulfur-oxidizing bacterium isolated from a black smoker
chimney in the Mid Atlantic Ridge (Takai et al., 2009) whose
16S rRNA gene sequence was very similar to that of strain
gps61T, as were some of its phenotypic features. However,
strain gps61T clearly differed from Thioprofundum lithotrophicum in the following characteristics. Optimum growth of
Thioprofundum lithotrophicum was observed at 50 uC,
whereas strain gps61T grew optimally at 39 uC and could
not grow at 50 uC. Strain gps61T was able to grow in the
presence of 20 % oxygen, whereas Thioprofundum lithotrophicum was unable to grow at oxygen concentrations .5 %.
Thioprofundum lithotrophicum used sulfite as an electron
donor, unlike strain gps61T. The genomic DNA G+C
content differed between strain gps61T (63 mol%) and
Thioprofundum lithotrophicum (66 mol%). Furthermore,

between strain gps61T and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum
showed relatedness values of only 11–21 %, strongly
suggesting that they should be classified as different species.
Based on its phylogenetic position as well as its phenotypic
and chemotaxonomic properties, strain gps61T represents a
novel species, for which the name Thioprofundum hispidum
sp. nov. is proposed.
Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences
revealed that strain gps61T and Thioprofundum lithotrophicum
could be clearly distinguished from the families Chromatiaceae,
Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Halothiobacillaceae of the order
Chromatiales in the class Gammaproteobacteria (Fig. 2).
Furthermore, this lineage contained Thioalkalispira microaerophila and Thiohalophilus thiocyanoxidans. Sorokin et al. (2002)
reported that Thioalkalispira microaerophila is an alkaliphilic
sulfur-oxidizing bacterium and the phylogenetic position
was deeply branched and obscured in the class Gammaproteobacteria; subsequently, it was tentatively classed as a
member of the family Ectothiorhodospiraceae based on the
taxonomic outlines of Bergey’s Manual of Systematic
Bacteriology (http://www.bergeys.org/outlines.html). The
phylogenetic position of Thiohalophilus thiocyanoxidans, a
halophilic sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, was only indicated as a
member of the class Gammaproteobacteria (Sorokin et al.,
2007). In our phylogenetic analyses, however, Thioalkalispira
microaerophila and Thiohalophilus thiocyanoxidans were part of
the same lineage, along with strain gps61T and Thioprofundum
lithotrophicum. Some phenotypic features of Thioalkalispira
microaerophila and Thiohalophilus thiocyanoxidans, such as
chemolithoautotrophy, sulfur-oxidation and moderately
halophily, were similar to those of strain gps61T and
Thioprofundum lithotrophicum (Table 1). Accordingly, we
propose the new family name Thioalkalispiraceae fam. nov.
2416

in the order Chromatiales to accommodate the genera
Thioalkalispira, Thiohalophilus and Thioprofundum. In the
order Chromatiales, the phylogenetic distances of members of
the novel family and those of the families Chromatiaceae,
Ectothiorhodospiraceae and Halothiobacillaceae, based on 16S
rRNA gene sequences, were 93.1 %, 92.9 % and 90.2 %,
respectively.

growth is 6–8 (optimum pH 7). The NaCl concentration for
growth ranges from 1 to 4 % (optimum 2 %). Either oxygen
or nitrate is used as an electron acceptor but nitrite,

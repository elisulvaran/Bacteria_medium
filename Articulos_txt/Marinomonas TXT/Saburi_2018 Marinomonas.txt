Isomerization

isomerase (MI) reversibly isomerizes D-mannose to D-fructose, and is attractive for producing
from inexpensive D-fructose. It belongs to the N-acylglucosamine 2-epimerase (AGE) superfamily along with AGE, cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE), and aldose-ketose isomerase (AKI). In this study,
Marinomonas mediterranea Marme_2490, showing low sequence identity with any known enzymes, was
found to isomerize D-mannose as its primary substrate. Marme_2490 also isomerized D-lyxose and 4-OH
D-mannose derivatives (D-talose and 4-O-monosaccharyl-D-mannose). Its activity for D-lyxose is known
in other D-mannose isomerizing enzymes, such as MI and AKI, but we identiﬁed, for the ﬁrst time, its
activity for 4-OH D-mannose derivatives. Marme_2490 did not isomerize D-glucose, as known MIs do not,
while AKI isomerizes both D-mannose and D-glucose. Thus, Marme_2490 was concluded to be an MI.
The initial and equilibrium reaction products were analyzed by NMR to illuminate mechanistic information regarding the Marme_2490 reaction. The analysis of the initial reaction product revealed that
b-D-mannose was formed. In the analysis of the equilibrated reaction products in D2O, signals of 2-H of Dmannose and 1-H of D-fructose were clearly detected. This indicates that these protons are not
substituted with deuterium from D2O and Marme_2490 catalyzes the intramolecular proton transfer
between 1-C and 2-C.
The crystal structure of Marme_2490 in a ligand-free form was determined and found that
Marme_2490 is formed by an (a/a)6-barrel, which is commonly observed in AGE superfamily enzymes.
Despite diverse reaction speciﬁcities, the orientations of residues involved in catalysis and substrate
binding by Marme_2490 were similar to those in both AKI (Salmonella enterica AKI) and epimerase
(Rhodothermus marinus CE). The Marme_2490 structure suggested that the a7/a8 and a11/a12 loops
of the catalytic domain participated in the formation of an open substrate-binding site to provide sufﬁcient space to bind 4-OH D-mannose derivatives.

Carbohydrate isomerases and epimerases catalyze the epimerization (interconversion of epimers) and isomerization (interconversion between aldose and ketose) of carbohydrates, respectively,
and are essential in carbohydrate metabolism processes, such as
glycolysis, the oxidative/reductive pentose phosphate pathways
and the Leloir pathway. These enzymes are very useful in enzymatic carbohydrate conversions in industry. D-Xylose isomerase (EC
5.3.1.5), isomerizing D-glucose to D-fructose, is widely used to

produce the D-fructose-rich syrup [1] and facilitates biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass [2]. Cellobiose 2-epimerase
(CE; EC 5.1.3.11) and D-tagatose 3-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.31) are useful for the efﬁcient productions of functional carbohydrates, epilactose [b-D-galactopyranosyl-(1/4)-D-mannose] and D-psicose,
respectively [3,4].
D-Mannose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.7, MI) is a carbohydrate isomerase catalyzing the reversible isomerization of D-mannose to Dfructose. This enzyme was ﬁrst found in Pseudomonas saccharophila
[5], and to date, enzymes from various bacterial species, including
Agrobacterium radiobacter [6], Mycobacterium smegmatis [7], Pseudomonas cepacia [8], Thermobiﬁda fusca [9], and Xanthomonas
rubrilineans [10], have been enzymatically characterized. MI converts inexpensive D-fructose to D-mannose at a conversion rate of
~30%, and has great potential in industrial D-mannose production.
Among the characterized MIs, only the amino acid sequence of
T. fusca MI (TfMI) is available [9], which shows high sequence
identity with YihS proteins, of the aldose-ketose isomerases (AKI),
from Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica at 41.5 and 42.8%,
respectively. AKI catalyzes the interconversion of D-mannose, Dglucose, and D-fructose [11]. MI is distinguishable from AKI, because
MI does not have detectable activity for D-glucose [5,6,9].
MI and AKI belong to the N-acylglucosamine 2-epimerase (AGE)
superfamily together with carbohydrate epimerases: AGE (EC
5.1.3.8), epimerizing N-acetyl-D-glucosamine to N-acetyl-D-mannosamine, and CE, catalyzing the interconversion between
reducing-end D-glucose and D-mannose residues of b-(1/4)-linked
disaccharides. AGE superfamily enzymes share the (a/a)6-barrel
catalytic domain and several residues involved in catalysis and
substrate binding (reducing-end sugar binding in CE) [11e15]. The
mechanism of isomerization has been predicted based on the
structure of S. enterica AKI (SeAKI) [11]; the catalytic His (His248 of
SeAKI) abstracts the 2-H of D-mannose, to generate a cis-enediolate
intermediate, and adds the proton to 1-C of the intermediate to
produce D-fructose (Fig. 1A) [5]. Upon isomerization, the 1-O and 2OH are protonated and deprotonated through an undetermined
process, respectively. In contrast, in epimerizations catalyzed by
AGE and CE, two catalytic His residues act as the general base and
acid catalysts (Fig. 1B). The ﬁrst catalytic His abstracts 2-H from the
substrate, to generate the cis-enediolate intermediate, and the
second catalytic His donates a proton to the intermediate, to produce the epimerized product [13e15].
The AGE superfamily includes many uncharacterized proteins

unclear. (B) Reaction mechanism of the epimerization. Amino acid numbering is for

that show low sequence similarity to any functionally known enzymes. Functional analysis of such uncharacterized proteins advances understanding the function-structure relationship of
superfamily members. A putative AGE, Marme_2490 (GenBank
number, ADZ91722.1) from a marine bacterium M. mediterranea,
has only 13.7e25.1% sequence identity with any characterized AGE
superfamily enzymes, and the function of this protein is as yet
unknown. In this study, the characteristics of recombinant
Marme_2490 produced in Escherichia coli were investigated and
the results showed that this protein was not an AGE but an MI.
Compared to other known MIs, Marme_2490 also possessed
isomerization activity towards 4-OH derivatives of D-mannose (Dtalose and 4-O-monosaccharyl-D-mannose). The three-dimensional
structure of Marme_2490 in free form was analyzed, and the molecular basis for its substrate speciﬁcity discussed in structural
comparison with other AGE superfamily enzymes.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Production of recombinant Marme_2490 in E. coli
The gene encoding Marme_2490 was ampliﬁed by PCR. The
genomic DNA of M. mediterranea NBRC 103028 (National Institute
of Technology and Evaluation Biological Resource Center, Chiba,
Japan) was used as the template. Primestar HS DNA polymerase
(Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan) was used. Primers used in the PCR are
as follows: 50 -AAAAAGAATTCATGTCTTACCCTGCATTTG-30 (sense
orientation, EcoRI site is underlined) and 50 -AAAAACTCGAGTAAGGTCAGTGTTTTCAAT-30 (antisense orientation, XhoI site is
underlined). The PCR product was cloned into pET23a (Novagen,
Darmstadt, Germany) using the restriction sites introduced. The
DNA sequence of the inserted DNA including its ﬂanking regions
was determined using an Applied Biosystems 3130 Genetic
Analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Using this expression plasmid, in recombinant Marme_2490 produced, 16 amino
acid residues (cloning artifact), Met-Ala-Ser-Met-Thr-Gly-Gly-GlnGln-Met-Gly-Arg-Gly-Ser-Glu-Phe, and 8 amino acid residues,
Leu-Glu-His-His-His-His-His-His, were attached to the N and Cterminals of the registered amino acid sequence, respectively.
E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformants harboring the expression
plasmid were cultured in 1 L of LB medium containing 50 mg/mL
ampicillin at 37  C. Protein expression was induced by the addition
of 0.1 M isopropyl b-thiogalactopyranoside to a ﬁnal concentration
of 0.1 mM when the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6. The induction culture was carried out at 16  C for 20 h. Bacterial cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 8400  g at 4  C for 10 min, and resuspended in 40 mL of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer containing
0.5 M NaCl (pH 7.0; buffer A). The cells were disrupted by sonication,
and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000  g at
4  C for 10 min. The cell-free extract obtained was applied onto a
Ni-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (3.0 cm i.d.  10.5 cm, GE
Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A containing 10 mM imidazole, and
the adsorbed protein was eluted by a linear gradient of imidazole
from 10 to 500 mM (total elution volume, 200 mL). The purity of the
fraction was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The fractions containing
highly puriﬁed protein were collected and dialyzed against 10 mM
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The sample was concentrated to
several mg/mL by ultraﬁltration using Vivaspin 20 centrifugal
concentrators (nominal molecular weight limit 30,000 Da; Sarto€ ttingen, Germany) and stored at 20  C in the presence of
rius, Go
50% glycerol. The concentration of the puriﬁed enzyme was
calculated from the amino acid concentrations after complete acid
hydrolysis using 6 M HCl. The amino acid concentrations were

W. Saburi et al. / Biochimie 144 (2018) 63e73

measured by the ninhydrin colorimetric method [16].
2.2. Screening of substrate
The reaction mixture (25 mL) containing 40 mM sugar, 40 mM
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.4 or 4.0 mM Marme_2490 was incubated at 30  C for 10 min or 16 h. Following sugars are tested as
candidate substrates: D-allose, 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol, D-glucose, Dlyxose, D-mannose, methyl a-D-glucoside, methyl b-D-glucoside, Dtagatose, D-xylose (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan);
D-altrose, cellobiose, 6-deoxy-D-glucose, D-mannose 6-phosphate,
L-rhamnose, D-talose, D-xylulose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA); Dfructose, D-galactose, D-glucitol, maltose, D-mannitol, N-acetyl-Dglucosamine (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan); 2-deoxy-D-glucose
(Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan); D-arabinose, lactose, sucrose (Kanto Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan), epilactose [3], lactulose [b-Dgalactopyranosyl-(1/4)-D-fructose;
Acros
Organics,
Geel,
Belgium], b-(1/4)-mannobiose [17], b-D-glucopyranosyl-(1/4)D-mannose (Glcb1-4Man) [18] and b-D-mannopyranosyl-(1/4)-Dglucose [17]. The reaction was terminated by heating at 100  C for
3 min. The sample (1 mL) was spotted onto a silica gel plate (TLC
Silica gel 60 F254 Aluminium sheet, 20 cm  20 cm, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and developed twice by 2-propanol/1-butanol/
water (2/2/1, v/v/v). Carbohydrates were detected by spraying a
detection reagent [acetic acid/sulfuric acid/anisaldehyde (100/2/1,
v/v/v)] onto the plate, followed by heating the plate.
2.3. Structural analysis of isomerized products from disaccharides
A reaction mixture (1 mL), containing 4.20e7.91 mM
Marme_2490, 100 mM disaccharide (b-(1/4)-mannobiose, Glcb14Man, or epilactose) and 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), was
incubated at 30  C for 24 h. The products were puriﬁed by TLC as
described in section 2.2. One hundred microliter of the sample was
applied per plate. The silica gel containing the product was scraped
and suspended in 1 mL of distilled water to elute the reaction
product. The gel was removed by centrifugation at 13,000  g at
4  C for 5 min. The supernatant was dried in vacuo at 40  C.
Chemical structures of the obtained products were analyzed by
electron spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR). ESI-MS was carried out with an Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc, San Jose, CA, USA). The
sample was subjected by ﬂow injection. Methanol was used as the
mobile phase solvent. The positive ion was detected under the
following conditions: spray voltage, 3.00 kV; capillary temperature,
300  C. NMR spectra were recorded in D2O (Sigma) at 27  C using a
Bruker AMX500 (500 MHz; Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA).
The chemical shifts in 13C-NMR for the products from Glcb1-4Man
and epilactose were compared with those for cellobiulose [b-Dglucopyranosyl-(1/4)-D-fructose] and lactulose [19], respectively.
A series of two-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear correlated
spectra [correlated spectroscopy, heteronuclear single quantum
correlation (HSQC), HSQC total correlation spectroscopy and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation correlated spectroscopy]
were acquired to determine the chemical structure of the reaction
product from b-(1/4)-mannobiose.
2.4. Enzyme assay
2.4.1. Standard enzyme assay
To determine isomerization activity against D-mannose, a reaction mixture (50 mL) containing 1e15 nM enzyme, 10 mM Dmannose, 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.02 mg/mL bovine
serum albumin was incubated at 30  C for 10 min. The reaction was
stopped by heating at 100  C for 3 min. The concentration of the

65

produced D-fructose was measured using a D-fructose assay reagent
(R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt, Germany). Authentic D-fructose
(0e2.5 mM) containing 10 mM D-mannose was used as the standard.
2.4.2. Effects of pH and temperature
The optimal pH was determined from the isomerization activity
toward 10 mM D-mannose at various pH values. The enzyme assay
was done under the conditions of the standard enzyme assay other
than the reaction buffer. Sodium acetate buffer (pH 3.2e6.1), MESNaOH buffer (pH 5.9e6.9), Tris-HCl buffer (pH 6.5e9.5) and BrittonRobinson buffer (pH 10.9e11.7) were used. The optimal temperature was examined by measuring enzyme activity at 10e50  C.
Stable ranges of pH and temperature were assessed by measuring
residual activity after pH and temperature treatments. For the pH
treatment, a mixture (50 mL) containing 20 mM Marme_2490 and
50 mM buffer described above (pH 3.2e11.7) was incubated at 4  C
for 24 h. For temperature treatment, a mixture (50 mL) containing
20 mM Marme_2490 and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) was incubated at
10e50  C for 30 min. The range, in which the enzyme retained over
90% of the original activity, was regarded as the stable range.
2.4.3. Kinetic parameters for the isomerization
Kinetic parameters for the isomerization of D-mannose, D-talose
and D-lyxose were determined from the reaction rates at various
substrate concentrations. A reaction mixture (350 mL) containing
4.0e746 nM Marme_2490, 1e35 mM substrate, 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.4) and 0.2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin was incubated at 30  C.
The reaction times for D-mannose, D-lyxose and D-talose were
15 min, 30 min and 6 h, respectively. Fifty micro-liters of the reaction mixture were taken every 3 min, 5 min and 1 h in the reaction with D-mannose, D-lyxose and D-talose, respectively. The
reaction was stopped by heating the sample at 100  C for 3 min. In
the reaction with D-mannose, D-fructose produced was measured as
described above. To determine the reaction rates for D-lyxose and Dtalose, D-xylulose and D-tagatose were quantiﬁed, respectively, according to the colorimetric quantiﬁcation method of ketoses [20]:
the sample (50 mL) was mixed with 75 mL of 0.5 mg/mL resorcinol in
ethanol and 75 mL of 0.216 g/L FeNH4(SO4)2$12H2O in HCl, and
incubated at 80  C for 40 min. The sample was cooled on ice, and
the absorbance values at 480 nm and 640 nm of the resulting solutions were measured to determine D-xylulose and D-tagatose,
respectively. As standards, 0e0.5 mM D-xylulose and 0e2.5 mM Dtagatose were used. Kinetic parameters were calculated by ﬁtting
the reaction velocities at various substrate concentrations to the
Michaelis-Menten equation using Graﬁt version 7.0.2 (Erithacus
Software, East Grinstead, UK).
2.4.4. Isomerization activity towards disaccharides
Isomerization activity to 100 mM b-(1/4)-mannobiose, epilactose, and Glcb1-4Man were measured. A reaction mixture
(1 mL), containing 5.12 mM Marme_2490, 100 mM substrate, 10 mM
Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), was incubated at 30  C for 4 h. Aliquots
(120 mL) were taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min, and
heated in boiling water for 3 min to stop the reaction. Ten microliter
of 130 mg/mL D-glucitol was added to the sample as internal
standard, and the concentrations of the reaction products were
determined by HPLC under following conditions: sample volume,
10 mL; column, HILIC Pak VG-50 4E (4.6 mm i.d.  250 mm; Shodex,
Tokyo, Japan); column temperature, 40  C; eluent, acetonitrile/
methanol/water (75/20/5, v/v/v); ﬂow rate, 1 mL/min; detection,
refractive index. Reaction velocity was calculated from the slope of
the progress curve for the disaccharide isomerization.
2.4.5. Inhibition kinetics of inorganic phosphate
Inhibition kinetics of inorganic phosphate were carried out by

66

W. Saburi et al. / Biochimie 144 (2018) 63e73

measuring the isomerization velocity to various concentrations of
D-mannose in the absence and presence of 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4). The reaction rates obtained were ﬁtted to the
competitive inhibition equation using Graﬁt version 7.0.2, and the
inhibition constant (Ki) of inorganic phosphate was determined.
2.5. Time course of the isomerization of D-mannose
A reaction mixture (375 mL) containing 1.28 mM Marme_2490,
10 mM D-mannose, and 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) was incubated at
30  C. Twenty-ﬁve mL samples were taken at indicated times and
the reaction was terminated at 100  C for 3 min. The D-fructose
concentration produced was measured as described in section 2.4.1.
2.6. NMR analysis of reaction products
1

H-NMR was used to monitor the isomerization of D-fructose to
D-mannose. H2O in the Marme_2490 solution was replaced with
D2O: the enzyme solution was diluted 10-fold with 10 mM HEPESNa buffer in D2O (pD 7.8), and concentrated to the original volume
by ultraﬁltration, as described above. These steps were repeated
three times in total. A reaction mixture (0.5 mL), containing 609 nM
Marme_2490, 250 mM D-fructose and 10 mM HEPES-Na buffer (pD
7.8), was placed into an NMR tube, and immediately 1H-NMR was
recorded at 35  C.
To obtain the reaction mixture that reached the equilibrium, the
reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 24 h. The
chemical structures of D-mannose and D-fructose in the mixture
were analyzed by two-dimensional NMR as described above.
2.7. Measurement of the molecular mass of Marme_2490 under
nondenaturing conditions
The molecular mass of Marme_2490 under nondenaturing
conditions was measured by gel-ﬁltration column chromatography
under the following conditions: column, Asahipac GF-510 HQ
(7.5 mm i.d.  300 mm, Shodex); buffer, 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer
containing 0.2 M NaCl (pH 7.0); ﬂow rate, 0.5 mL/min; detection,
absorbance at 280 nm. The Gel Filtration Standard (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) containing a standard set of proteins was used to
calibrate the gel-ﬁltration column.
2.8. Crystallization and data collection of Marme_2490
Initial crystallization screening was performed using a series of
crystallization kits from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) by the sittingdrop vapor-diffusion method, in which 0.75 mL of 10 mg/mL protein solution in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) was mixed with an
equal volume of the reservoir solutions. The appropriate crystals of
Marme_2490 were obtained within 1 month at 20  C under the
reservoir solution containing 80 mM sodium potassium phosphate,
0.1 M Bis Tris propane (pH 6.5) and 20% (w/v) PEG3350.
For X-ray diffraction experiments, the crystals of Marme_2490
were directly picked up from crystallization solution and ﬂash
cooled. Diffraction data were collected on beamline BL-44XU at
SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan), under a stream of liquid nitrogen at 100 K.
The data set was indexed, integrated, scaled and merged using the
XDS program suite [21]. The asymmetric unit of Marme_2490
contained two molecules corresponding to a Matthews coefﬁcient
[22] of 2.6 Å3 Da1 and an estimated solvent content of 52.8%. The
data collection and processing statistics are summarized in Table 3.
2.9. Structure solution and reﬁnement of Marme_2490
The structure of Marme_2490 was determined by the molecular

replacement method with the program AutoMR in the Phenix
program package [23,24], using the structure of acylglucosamine 2epimerase (PDB ID: 3GT5) as the search model. Several rounds of
reﬁnement were performed using the program Phenix.reﬁne in the
Phenix program suite, alternating with manual ﬁtting and
rebuilding, based on 2FoFc and FoFc electron density using
COOT [24,25]. The ﬁnal reﬁnement statistics and geometry deﬁned
by MolProbity [26] are shown in Table 3. All ﬁgures of structures
were generated by the PyMol molecular graphics system version
€dinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA).

3. Results
3.1. Substrate speciﬁcity
Recombinant Marme_2490 harboring a C-terminal His-tag was
produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. From the cell-free extract obtained from 1 L of the culture broth, recombinant Marme_2490
(19.4 mg) was puriﬁed to homogeneity by immobilized metal (Ni)
afﬁnity column chromatography. To screen substrates, the puriﬁed
enzyme was incubated with various carbohydrates. Recombinant
Marme_2490 (0.4 mM) converted D-mannose, D-fructose, D-lyxose
and D-xylulose to D-fructose, D-mannose, D-xylulose and D-lyxose,
respectively, in a 10 min reaction period (Fig. 2), indicating that
Marme_2490 reversibly isomerized D-mannose and D-lyxose to the
corresponding ketoses. In longer reaction (16 h) with a higher
concentration of enzyme (4.0 mM), D-talose and D-tagatose were
detected as the reaction products from D-tagatose and D-talose,
respectively. The reaction products from b-(1/4)-mannobiose,
epilactose, and Glcb1-4Man were also detected. The chemical
structures of the disaccharide products were analyzed by ESI-MS
and NMR. The masses of all these disaccharide-products were
365.11 m/z [M þ Na]þ. The chemical shifts in the 13C-NMR for the
products from epilactose and Glcb1-4Man coincided with the reported values for lactulose and cellobiulose [19], respectively. The
chemical structure of the reaction product from b-(1/4)-mannobiose was determined to be b-D-mannopyranosyl-(1/4)-Dfructose by two-dimensional NMR analysis (Table 1). The D-fructose
residue adopted the b-D-fructopyranose- and b-D-fructofuranoseforms as the major and minor species, respectively, as judged from
the signal intensity at 27  C. No product was detected in the longterm reactions with D-allose, D-altrose, 1,5-anhydro-D-glucitol, Darabinose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, 6-deoxy-D-glucose, D-galactose, Dglucose, methyl a-D-glucopyranoside, methyl b-D-glucopyranoside,
N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, L-rhamnose, sugar alcohols (D-glucitol and
D-mannitol), sugar phosphate (D-mannose 6-phosphate) and
following disaccharides: cellobiose, lactose, maltose, b-D-mannopyranosyl-(1/4)-D-glucose and sucrose.
3.2. Kinetic analysis of the isomerization catalyzed by Marme_2490
Marme_2490 showed the highest D-mannose-isomerizing activity at pH 7.3 and 30  C. This enzyme was stable at 35  C and lower
(at pH 7.0 for 30 min), and in a pH range of 6.0e9.4 (4  C for 24 h).
The kinetic parameters of Marme_2490 for D-mannose, D-lyxose
and D-talose were determined (Table 2). Marme_2490 showed the

mannose is determined as the primary substrate of Marme_2490.
The isomerization of 10 mM D-mannose by Marme_2490 was
monitored at 30  C (Fig. 3). At reaction 80 min, the reaction reached
the equilibrium, and D-fructose concentration was 6.98 mM, indicating 69.8% conversion of D-mannose. This result is consistent with
the previously reported conversion levels, 65%e75%, obtained using MIs from M. smegmatis, P. cepacia, T. fusca and X. rubrilineans
[7e10].

3.3. NMR analysis of the reaction product generated from Dfructose in D2O
The isomerization of D-fructose to D-mannose by Marme_2490
was monitored by 1H-NMR (Fig. 4A). During the initial stage of the
reaction, the 1-H signal of b-D-mannose (4.92 ppm) was higher
than that of a-D-mannose (5.18 ppm), which is more abundant than
b-D-mannose in the equilibrium aqueous solution of D-mannose.

After incubating the reaction mixture at room temperature for
24 h to prepare the equilibrated mixture, two-dimensional NMR
analysis of D-mannose and D-fructose in the sample was performed.
The signals from 2-H of D-mannose and 1-H of b-D-fructopyranose
and b-D-fructofuranose were clearly detected in the HSQC analysis
(Fig. 4B and C), despite the reaction being performed in D2O. Thus,
these protons were not substituted with deuterium from the reaction solvent upon isomerization.
3.4. Structural analysis of Marme_2490

Fig. 3. Time course of isomerization of D-mannose. Isomerization of 10 mM D-mannose
was monitored by measuring the concentration of D-fructose produced.

This result suggests that Marme_2490 produced b-D-mannose from
D-fructose. The signal representing a-D-mannose increased at a
later stage of the reaction.

The structure of Marme_2490 was determined at 2.6 Å resolution (Fig. 5A, Table 3). The overall structure of Marme_2490 is
nearly identical to that of a putative AGE from Xylella fastidiosa
(XfAGE, PDB ID: 3GT5) with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of
0.75 Å for 386 superimposed Ca atoms, and contains a typical (a/
a)6-barrel domain. Two molecules were observed in the asymmetric unit (molecule-A and molecule-B). The structures of these
two molecules were almost identical (RMSD for all Ca atoms was
0.26 Å). Since the electron density of molecule-B was seen more
clearly than that of molecule-A (residues Asp232eArg243 of the
a7/a8 loop, connecting the 7th and 8th a-helices, of molecule-A
were disorder), we describe the structure based on molecule-B.
The molecular mass of Marme_2490 under nondenaturing conditions was determined to be about 42 kDa by gel ﬁltration column
chromatography (Fig. 5). This molecular mass was close to the
calculated molecular mass of the monomeric protein from the
amino acid sequence (48.8 kDa), and thus, Marme_2490 was a

phosphate inhibited the D-mannose isomerization of Marme_2490
through a competitive inhibition process, because the lines obtained from the reaction rates in the absence and presence of
inorganic phosphate crossed on the y-axis in the Lineweaver-Burk
(double-reciprocal) plots (Fig. 7). The Ki value was determined to
be 31.5 ± 1.4 mM.
The structure of Marme_2490 was superimposed well onto
SeAKI in both the substrate-free form (PDB ID: 2AFA) and the
complex with D-mannose (H248A) [11] (Fig. 6B). The orientation of
the side chain of His251 of Marme_2490 was similar to that of
catalytic His248 of SeAKI in the apo-form, indicating that His251 of
Marme_2490 is the catalytic residue. The orientations of Arg57,
Asn174, His178, Glu254, Trp312, and His380 of Marme_2490 are
also almost identical with corresponding residues of SeAKI, which
are involved in the substrate binding. MI and CE catalyze reactions
differently from each other, but no obvious structural differences
were found in the catalytic sites of Marme_2490 and Rhodothermus
marinus CE (RmCE) in substrate-free (PDB ID: 3WKF) conditions
and in complex with Glcb1-4Man (PDB ID 3WKG; Fig. 6C) [15].

In the structure, a phosphate molecule, which is presumably
captured from the crystallization buffer, was observed at the catalytic center (Fig. 6A). All the oxygens of the phosphate were coordinated by surrounding residues which are predicted to be involved
in substrate binding. Superimposition of Marme_2490 and the
complex of SeAKI with D-mannose (H248A mutant; PDB ID: 2ZBL)
suggested that two oxygen atoms of the phosphate were positioned
at the equivalent positions of 1-O and 5-O of D-mannose. Inorganic

4. Discussion
Carbohydrate isomerases and epimerases have important
functions in various carbohydrate metabolisms, and are useful in
industrial carbohydrate enzymatic conversions. MI, a member of
the AGE superfamily, is an attractive enzyme that produces Dmannose from inexpensive D-fructose. In this study, Marme_2490,
registered as an AGE in the sequence database and showing low
sequence similarity with any known enzymes, was shown to not
epimerize N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, but instead isomerizes Dmannose as the primary substrate.
The amino acid sequence of Marme_2490 is 53.8%e62.4%
identical to uncharacterized orthologues from Marinomonas,
Pseudomanas, Xanthomonas and Xylella species: Marinomonas posidonica Mar181_2063 (GenBank ID, AEF55101.1), Marinomonas
profundimaris D104_03355 (GenBank ID, ETI61935.1), Marinomonas
ushuaiensis MUS1_08255 (GenBank ID, ETX11921.1), Pseudomonas
luteoviolacea JF50_16005, (GenBank ID, KID55850.1), Pseudomonas
oryzihabitans APT59_12760 (GenBank ID, ALZ85017.1), Pseudomonas psychrotolerans NS337_14990 (GenBank ID, KTT52847.1),
Xanthomonas axonopodis XAXN_18570 (GenBank ID, KPL47648.1),
and Xylella fastidiosa RA12_07325 (GenBank ID, KIA58312.1). No
genes predicted to be involved in carbohydrate metabolism were
present in the neighboring genes of Marme_2490, but the putative
fructokinase genes, JF50-16000 of P. luteoviolacea (GenBank number, KID55849.1) and RA12_07320 of X. fastidiosa (GenBank number,
KIA58311.1) were present. This implied that these orthologues
isomerized D-mannose to D-fructose. D-Fructose produced was
presumed to be phosphorylated by the fructokinase and metabolized through the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. The putative
fructokinase gene (Marme_4041; GenBank number, ADZ93249.1)
was also present in the M. mediterranea genome, and thus,
Marme_2490 was likely involved in D-mannose metabolism
together with the fructokinase.
In the kinetic analysis of D-mannose isomerization (Table 2),
Marme_2490 showed 2.9e113-fold higher kcat/Km than those of
E. coli AKI (EcAKI), SeAKI, and TfMI, even though the kinetic analysis
of Marme_2490 was conducted at a lower temperature (30  C) than
the compared enzymes (37e50  C). Among these four enzymes, the
kcat/Km values of EcAKI and SeAKI for D-mannose were considerably
low, although Itoh et al. have reported that D-mannose was the best
substrate of these enzymes among tested substrates [11]. Recently,
the isomerization activity of EcAKI to sulphoquinovose (6-deoxy-6sulphogulucose) to 6-deoxy-6-sulphofructose was described [27],
and EcAKI might use sulphoquionvose as a better substrate than D-

mannose.
MI and AKI are distinguishable based on their isomerization
activities for D-glucose: AKI has a weak but apparent D-glucose
isomerizing activity [11], while MI does not [5,6,9]. The isomerization activity of Marme_2490 toward D-glucose was not detectable
in substrate screening, which clearly indicated that Marme_2490
was not an AKI but an MI. As D-xylose was also not isomerized by
Marme_2490, the axial OH group at the D-aldose 2-C position was
essential for the catalytic activity of Marme_2490.
Marme_2490 possessed isomerization activity for D-lyxose, as
has been observed in other D-mannose-isomerizing enzymes, such
as MIs and AKIs [6,9,11]. In the complex of SeAKI and D-mannose

[11], the D-mannose 6-OH forms hydrogen bond with Arg55, which
is highly conserved in AGE superfamily members. The activity of
MIs and AKIs to D-lyxose indicated that this interaction was not
essential for catalysis.
In addition to isomerization activities to D-mannose and D-lyxose, Marme_2490 isomerized 4-OH derivatives of D-mannose, Dtalose, and b-(1/4)-disaccharides. Isomerization activity for these
sugars was ﬁrst reported in Marme_2490 and is useful as a biocatalyst for carbohydrate conversions.
The structural basis for Marme_2490's substrate speciﬁcity was
addressed by comparing the structure of Marme_2490 in free form
with SeAKI and RmCE. In SeAKI, the orientations of its a7/a8 and

a11/a12 loops are different in the substrate-free form and the
complex with D-mannose (Fig. 8A and B) [11]. The a7/a8 loop of
SeAKI is distal from the substrate-binding site in the substrate-free
form, but is situated near the D-mannose substrate in the complex.
Phe241 in this loop is in close proximity to the 4-C, 5-C, and 6-C of
D-mannose, and is predicted to cause severe steric hindrance when
the enzyme binds a disaccharide-substrate (Fig. 8B). Consistent
with this prediction, the a7/a8 loop of a disaccharide-acting CE is
clearly shorter than in monosaccharide speciﬁc enzymes and contributes to the formation of an open substrate-binding site to
accommodate disaccharide substrates (Fig. 8C) [15]. The SeAKI
a11/a12 loop is disordered in the apo-form (Fig. 8A), but is ordered when complexed with D-mannose (Fig. 8B). The Trp375 in
this loop forms a hydrophobic interaction with the D-mannose 6-C
and the Arg240 side chain in the a7/a8 loop (Fig. 8B). These loops
close the substrate-binding site entrance in the D-mannose
complex.
The a7/a8 loop of Marme_2490 in the apo-form also adopted
an open-form, as has been observed in the apo-form of SeAKI
(Fig. 8A) [11]. As this loop in molecule-A of Marme_2490 was
disordered (see above), this loop was hypothesized to be more
ﬂexible than the same loop in SeAKI. The a7/a8 loop of
Marme_2490 contained Phe242, corresponding to SeAKI Phe241
but had a Leu241 at the corresponding position of SeAKI Arg240.
The a11/a12 loop of Marme_2490 was ordered even in the
substrate-free form and assumed an open-orientation similar to
that of RmCE (Fig. 8C). In addition, the enzyme did not contain Trp
corresponding to Trp375 of SeAKI. Therefore, the a7/a8 and
a11/a12 loops of Marme_2490 were hypothesized not to interact
with each other. The entrance of Marme_2490's active pocket in the
substrate complex was presumably more open than SeAKI, and the
open substrate-binding site provided space for binding 4-OH derivatives of D-mannose. TfMI does not have Arg at the corresponding position of Arg240 of SeAKI (Pro241) but has Trp375
corresponding to Trp375 of SeAKI.
The isomerization mechanism of Marme_2490 was examined
and discussed by NMR analysis of the anomeric conﬁguration of Dmannose from D-fructose in the initial reaction and the presence of

deuterium in D-mannose and D-fructose in the equilibrated reaction
mixture. In the initial reaction, the signal of the b-D-mannose 1-H
was more strongly detected than that of a-D-mannose generated,
indicating that Marme_2490 produce b-D-mannose from D-fructose. Gradual formation of a-D-mannose observed in the later reaction was presumably because of nonenzymatic mutarotation. The
anomeric conﬁguration of the reaction product by Marme_2490
was consistent with ligands bound to SeAKI and RmCE [11,15]. As
lactose and cellobiose in the formation of the complexes of wildtype RmCE are epimerized in crystals [15], D-mannose residues in
the RmCE complex are considered the product form. Marme_2490
presumably formed b-D-mannose through a ring closure process, in
a manner postulated for SeAKI and RmCE [11,15].
In NMR analysis of equilibrated reaction products, the signals of
protons at the D-mannose 2-C and D-fructose 1-C were clearly

72

W. Saburi et al. / Biochimie 144 (2018) 63e73

detected, which suggested that the proton abstracted from Dfructose was not substituted with deuterium from D2O solvent. This
was essentially different from the proton abstraction/addition
mechanism postulated in CE and AGE [13,15]. MI is thought to abstract the proton from 1-C of D-fructose to form the cis-enediolate
intermediate and add the 2-C proton of the intermediate to produce D-mannose. This mechanism in D-fructose isomerization was
also postulated based on the structure of SeAKI [11]. The His
conserved at the N-terminus of the 8th a-helix of the catalytic
domain (His251 in Marme_2490 and His248 in SeAKI) was predicted to act as a general base and acid catalyst (Fig. 1A).
In D-fructose isomerization, deprotonation of 1-O and protonation of 2-O are also required (Fig. 1A), but their mechanisms
remain unclear. The essential His residue in the 6th a-helix (His176
in SeAKI) is predicted to form hydrogen bonds with both 1-OH and
2-OH of D-mannose [11] (Fig. 6B), and might transfer the proton
from 1-O to 2-O in D-mannose formation. This His is invariant not
only in AKI and MI but also in CE. In Ruminococcus albus CE, His184
has been shown to be essential for epimerization activity [14], and
the His in the 6th a-helix is essential for catalysis of both the
isomerase and epimerase reactions (e.g., stabilization of cis-enediolate intermediates through hydrogen-bonding interactions). The
proton transfer from 1-O to 2-O, which is not mediated by enzyme
amino acid residues, might be possible in MI, because no residues
are thought to be required for the proton transfer in the reaction of
phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9) [28].
MI and CE catalyze different reactions, but the superimposition
of the Marme_2490 structure on RmCE structures showed only
slight differences in the orientations of amino acid residues
involved in catalysis and substrate binding (Fig. 6C). Thus, the
molecular mechanism determining the reaction speciﬁcity of AGE
superfamily enzymes was unable to be explained by our present
knowledge. Further structural and functional analyses of AGE superfamily enzymes are necessary to understand the molecular basis
for their reaction speciﬁcity.

Three Gram-negative bacterial strains (Cmf 17.2T, Rd 20.33 and Cmf 18.22T) isolated from
reared clams in Galicia were subjected to a taxonomic study, based on genetic and phenotypic
characterization. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene allowed the identification of the strains as
members of the genus Marinomonas, sharing the highest similarity with Marinomonas aquimarina
CECT 5080T (97.8 %–98.5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). Phylogenetic analysis of the
sequences showed that the three isolates formed two different groups distantly related to their
closest relative, M. aquimarina. DNA–DNA hybridizations were performed to confirm the
taxonomic position and the results were below the recommended threshold for species
delimitation, specifically 44.5 % (Cmf 17.2T with M. aquimarina CECT 5080T) and 55 % (Cmf
18.22Twith M. aquimarina CECT 5080T). Furthermore, the average nucleotide identity (ANIb,
ANIm and OrthoANI) and in silico estimated DNA–DNA reassociation values among Cmf 17.2T,
Cmf 18.22T and M. aquimarina CECT 5080T were in all cases below the respective threshold
for species differentiation. The estimated G+C content of the genomic DNA was found to be
45.3 % (Cmf 17.2T) and 44.6 % (Cmf 18.22T). The principal fatty acids of the strains were found
to be summed feature 3 (C16 : 1 !7c/C16 : 1!6c), summed feature 8 (C18 : 1!7c/C18 : 1!6c),
C16 : 0, C12 : 0 and C10 : 0 3-OH. The results obtained on the characterization of the clam isolates
indicate that they represent two novel species of the genus Marinomonas, for which the names
Marinomonas gallaica sp. nov. (type strain Cmf 17.2T=CECT 9049T=LMG 29243T) and
Marinomonas atlantica sp. nov. (type strain Cmf 18.22T=CECT 9050T=LMG 29244T) are
proposed.

The genus Marinomonas, within the family Oceanospirillaceae, is composed of Gram-negative bacteria that are present in different marine environments such as the
Mediterranean sea (Solano & Sanchez-Amat, 1999; Macian

Ocean (Zhang et al., 2008). The genus was proposed by Van
Landschoot & De Ley (1983) to accommodate two unusual
species of the genus Alteromonas, Alteromonas communis
and Alteromonas vaga. In recent years, the number of
described species has increased and, at the time of writing,
the genus Marinomonas comprises 24 recognized species
(http://www.bacterio.net/marinomonas.html) after the
reclassification of Marinomonas basaltis as a later heterotypic synonym of Marinomonas communis (Chimetto et al.,
2011). In this study we report the characterization of three
strains belonging to the genus Marinomonas isolated from
reared clams in Galicia (Spain) and determine their taxonomic position within the genus.

Marinomonas aquimarina CECT 5080T was provided by the
Spanish Collection of Type Cultures (CECT) and included
in the study for taxonomic and phenotypic comparison. All
strains were cultured on marine agar (MA; Difco) at 24
±1  C for 24 h. Cultures were maintained frozen at 80  C
in marine broth (MB; Difco) supplemented with 15 % (v/v)
glycerol.
Genomic DNA was extracted from 24 h cultures on MA for
in vitro amplification of the 16S rRNA gene using the InstaGene Matrix (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequences for reference strains were retrieved from the
GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases. Sequence analyses were
performed using the DNASTAR Lasergene SEQMAN program. Sequence similarities of the 16S rRNA gene were
determined using the EzTaxon-e server (www.eztaxone.
ezbiocloud.net) (Kim et al., 2012) and the BLASTN program,
and checked with the Species Living Tree Project (LTP)
database (www.arb-silva.de/living-tree) that has frequently
been used for delineating bacterial species due to its high
quality sequences (Yarza et al., 2008, 2014). Sequences were
aligned using CLUSTALW tool (Larkin et al., 2007), and phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the neighbourjoining (NJ) and maximum-likelihood (ML) algorithms in
MEGA software package version 6.06 (Tamura et al., 2011).
Distance matrices were calculated by using Kimura’s twoparameter correction and stability of the groups was estimated by bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates) using MEGA
version 6.06 (Tamura et al., 2011).
Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the
three strains belonged to the genus Marinomonas, showing
the highest sequence similarity with the type strains of
M. aquimarina (97.8 %–98.5 %), Marinomonas ostreistagni
(97.3 %–97.4 %), Marinomonas fungiae (97.2 %–97.3 %),
and Marinomonas brasilensis (97.1 %–97.2 %). Similarity
between strains Cmf 17.2T and Rd 20.33 was 99.5 %, and
between Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T was 97.9 %. According
to the LTP database, sequence similarities ranging between
94.5 % and 98.7 % suggest that the microbial strain can be
classified as a member of a given genus, whereas higher similarities would be indicative of belonging to a given species
(Yarza et al., 2008). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S
rRNA gene sequences, made with NJ and ML approaches,
showed that the clam isolates form two different groups
within the genus (Fig. 1). Strains Cmf 17.2T and Rd 20.33
clustered together in an independent branch from strain
Cmf 18.22T and M. aquimarina CECT 5080T, suggesting
that these isolates may represent two novel species. Thus,
Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T were selected as representative
strains for further analyses.

2014). Genome assembly was performed using SPAdes
3.6.1 (Nurk et al., 2013). The G+C content of the chromosomal DNA was calculated on the basis of its whole-genome
sequence. The ANIb, ANIm and OrthoANI values were calculated as described by Richter & Rosselló-Móra (2009)
using JSpecies (V1.2.1), and Lee et al. (2015). Estimated
DNA–DNA hybridization (eDDH) value was determined
between these two strains using the genome-to-genome distance calculator (GGDC2.1) (Auch et al., 2010a, b; MeierKolthoff et al., 2013). The DNA G+C content was estimated
according to the draft genome of strains Cmf 17.2T and
Cmf 18.22T, and was found to be 45.3 % and 44.6 % respectively, which are in the range of the genus (i.e., 41–50 %)
(Espinosa et al., 2010). Average nucleotide identity (ANI)
and eDDH calculations were performed to elucidate
genome similarities and species assignation of strains Cmf
17.2T and Cmf 18.22T. The values obtained using these
indexes (Table 1) were below the respective thresholds (95–
96 % ANI and 70 % eDDH) indicating that these strains
represent two novel species of the genus. Additionally,
OrthoANI (Lee et al., 2015) values showed similarities of
76.26 % between M. aquimarina CECT 5080T and Cmf
17.2T, 76.01 % between M. aquimarina CECT 5080T and
Cmf 18.22T and 90.75 % between strains Cmf 17.2T and
Cmf 18.22T.
DDH experiments were undertaken between the strains
Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T against the type strain of the
species with highest similarity in the 16S rRNA gene,
M. aquimarina CECT 5080T. DDH experiments were performed with the hydroxyapatite/microtitre plate method
(Ziemke et al., 1998) using a hybridization temperature
(Tm) of 50  C. Reciprocal reactions (i.e. AB and BA)
were performed and were generally within the limits of this
method (Goris et al., 1998). Results obtained from DDH
experiments between Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T with
M. aquimarina CECT 5080T confirmed their separate status
at the species level since the reassociation values were always
below the recommended threshold; 44.5 % reassociation
value for Cmf 17.2T with M. aquimarina CECT 5080T and
55 % reassociation value for Cmf 18.22T with M. aquimarina CECT 5080T. The reassociation value between strains
Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T was 45.5 %.

High Pure PCR Template Preparation kit (Roche) was
employed for isolation of genomic DNA for whole-genome
sequencing and DNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) experiments. The genomes of strains Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22T
were sequenced at Sistemas Genómicos (Valencia, Spain)
using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. The
reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic 0.32 (Bolger et al.,

The three clam isolates and M. aquimarina CECT 5080T
were subjected to the following phenotypic tests (MacFaddin,
1993): cell morphology and motility, Gram stain, oxidase,
catalase, oxidation/fermentation test, gas and acid production
from glucose, indole, methyl red, Voges–Proskauer reaction,
utilization of citrate, Thornley’s arginine dihydrolase test,
Moeller’s arginine dihydrolase and lysine and ornithine
decarboxylases, nitrate reduction, and hydrolysis of gelatin,
Tween 80, amylase and aesculin. Salt tolerance tests were performed on Basal medium agar [BMA: neopeptone (4 g l 1),
yeast extract (1 g l 1) and bacteriological agar (15 g l 1)]
supplemented with 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 8 and 10 % NaCl. Growth
at different temperatures (4, 20, 25, 30, 37 and 44  C) and
pH (4–10) were also determined. All media were supplemented with 1 % NaCl when required. Additional

phenotypic characteristics were determined using API ZYM
strips (bioMerieux) and Biolog GN2 plates, according to the
manufacturers’ instructions. Furthermore, utilization of additional sugars, alcohols and organic acids as sole carbon
source was determined on plates of basal medium agar
(Baumann 1981) supplemented with 1 % (w/v) of the corresponding organic compound. The following substrates were
tested: D-ribose, arabinose, D-xylose, D-glucose, fructose,
D-galactose, trehalose, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, maltose, cellobiose, sucrose, lactose, melibiose, salicin, amygdalin, gluconic acid, D-mannitol, sorbitol, myo-inositol, glycerol,

D-saccharic acid.
Bacterial cells were straight rods and cell motility was
observed. The isolates grow unpigmented on MA plates with
small regular colonies. All strains are oxidase- and catalasepositive with aerobic metabolism. The presence of salt is
required for growth. Produced enzymatic activities are listed
in the species descriptions and the differences among the
three strains are shown in Table S1 (available in the online
Supplementary Material). In addition, Biolog GN2 results
showed several differences among the clam isolates (Table S1

Moreover, the clam isolates can be distinguished from each
other on the ability to use L-arabinose and D-galactose - activities present in Cmf 18.22Tbut absent in Cmf 17.2T and Rd
20.33. On the other hand, Cmf 17.2T and Rd 20.33 are capable of using sucrose, glycine, and lysine but Cmf 18.22T is
not able to use these compounds (Table 2).

C10 : 0 3-OH (Table 3). FAME profiles also showed differences
in the percentages of the main fatty acid among the three type
strains, such as in summed feature 3 or C10 : 0 3-OH.
In summary, the taxonomic study of the three clam isolates
supports the proposal of two novel species of the genus
Marinomonas, for which the names Marinomonas gallaica
sp. nov. and Marinomonas atlantica sp. nov. are proposed
with Cmf 17.2T and Cmf 18.22Tas respective type strains.

Chemotaxonomic features were studied by the analyses of
fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). FAME were extracted and
prepared from 24 h cultures on MA incubated at 24±1  C as
described by Sasser (1990) according to the MIDI Microbial
Identification System. In all strains the principal fatty acids
were found to be summed feature 3 (C16 : 1!7c/C16 : 1!6c),
summed feature 8 (C18 : 1!7c/C18 : 1!6c), C16: 0, C12 : 0 and

Abstract A serine protease-producing marine bacterial
strain named as PT-1 was isolated and identified as a
family of Marinomonas arctica, based on molecular characterization of 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic
tree, and fatty acid composition analyses. Optimized culture conditions for growth of the bacterium PT-1 and
production of protease (ProA) were determined to be pH
8.0 in the presence of 5 % NaCl, at 37 °C during 24 h of
incubation in the presence of 1.0 % skim milk. The
molecular weight of the purified ProA was estimated to be
63-kDa as a major band by SDS-PAGE. We were intrigued
to find that the activity of ProA was not inhibited by
pepstatin A, chymostatin, and leupeptin known as inhibitors for cysteine protease. However, phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF) completely inhibited protease activity,
suggesting that the ProA is like a serine protease. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first report on serine
protease of Marinomonas species.

Introduction
Among the different industrial enzymes, proteases,
which can be obtained from plants, animals, and
microbial sources, the latter such as bacteria [1, 2]

account for up to 60 % of protease sources in various
industries including food, detergents, production of
nutritionally important amino acids, and pharmaceutical
manufacture applications. Extracellular proteases secreted into culture medium by many bacteria differ from
one another in their biochemical properties [3, 4].
Therefore, the practical use of microbial proteases has
led to the isolation of hyperactive strains, the development and characterization of novel biochemical
properties including substrate specificity, thermo-stability, and detergent resistance.
Until recently, microbial sources, in particular the
genus of Bacillus known as one of the most important
producers of extracellular proteases from B. subtilis [5], B.
halodurans [6], and B. laterosporus [7], have been
extensively studied by many researchers. Beside bacterial
proteases, fungal keratinase [8] has also attracted the
attention of environmental biotechnologists since fungi
secrete large amount of enzymes into the culture medium,
which facilitates downstream processing for industrial
production and applications [6]. Among the genus of many
fungi known to exhibit high keratinolytic activities,
Aspergillus keratinase activity from A. niger [9] has been
extensively studied. Due to the high industrial demand for
proteases, researchers continue to isolate and indentify
potent protease producers. Earlier studies have demonstrated that many bacterial and fungal species secrete a
substantial amount of proteolytic enzymes including coldadaptive proteases [10, 11]. However, there are no reports
on the production and characterization of protease from M.
arctica species. In the present study, we communicate the
isolation and characterization of marine bacterium M.
arctica (KTCC 12465BP) producing a halophilic extracellular protease, isolated from the sea-mud called Getpearl in South Korea.

Bacterial strain and culture conditions for protease
production

Chemicals
Azocasein, casein, skim milk, gelatin, and bovine serum
albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma Chemical
Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), chymostatin, leupeptin used as
inhibitors for cysteine protease, and Coomassie Brilliant
Blue R250 were also purchased from Sigma Chemical
Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Columns of HiPrep 16/10 Q
XL and SuperdexTM 75 HR 10/30 were purchased from
GE Healthcare (GE Healthcare Science AB, Sweden).
Other protein sources such as bean powder, fishery
powder, and keratins were kindly provided by Prof. Yu
Jin Hwang (Gachon University, Korea). All the other
chemicals used were of analytical grade manufactured in
Korea.
Gene sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses
A marine bacterial strain named as PT-1 that produces
halophilic protease exclusively was selected and subjected
to the 16S rDNA sequences and phylogenetic analyses to
identify the microbial species. The 16S rDNA gene
sequences determined was aligned based on the secondary
structure of the ribosomal RNA, and estimated % similarity
through the DNA data bank. A phylogenetic tree analysis
based on 16S rDNA gene sequences data to classify the
isolate was constructed using the CLUSTAL W program
and the neighbor-joining method, following the previous
study [12].
Analysis of fatty acid methyl esters composition
Bacterial cells were centrifuged and lyophilized using a
freeze-dryer (FDUT-6002, Operon, Gimpo, Korea) for fatty
acid methyl esters (FAMEs) analysis. Briefly, dried samples
were dissolved in 2 mL of solution freshly prepared by
mixing acetyl chloride and methanol (5:100, v/v) with
nonadecanoic acid (19:0) as an internal standard, making a
concentration of 1 mg/L. Trans-esterification reaction was
performed at 80 °C for 1 h under pure nitrogen gas stream
and darkness. FAMEs obtained by trans-esterification
reaction were extracted by addition of 1 mL hexane.
FAMEs were then analyzed by using a gas chromatograph
equipped with flame ionization detector (Acme 6000 GC,
Younglin, Seoul, Korea) with HP-INNOW WAX column
(length = 100 m, diameter = 0.25 mm, and film thickness = 0.2 lm). The FAMEs were identified by comparing
their retention time with those of FAMEs standards mixture
(F.A.M.E. Mix C4-C24, SUPELCO, Bellefonte, USA).

123

A potent protease producer M. arctica PT-1 (KTCC
12465BP) which revealed hydrolyzing activity on solidagar plate containing 1.0 % skim milk was isolated from
the sea-mud (called Getpearl) in South Korea and used for
this study. This marine bacterial strain PT-1 was further
cultured for protease production in culture medium
(250 mL) consisting of MgSO4 (0.05 %), yeast extract
(0.05 %), peptone (0.05 %), and dibasic sodium phosphate
(0.05 %) in sea-water for 24 h at room temperature, with
constant shaking at 150 rpm (JEIO TECH Co., Korea). The
crude culture filtrate obtained by filtration through 0.2 lm
filter membrane (Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Ltd, Japan) was used
as enzyme source for purification.
Purification of protease
The enzyme in the cell-free culture filtrate (250 mL) was
precipitated with ammonium sulfate (20 % saturation) and
then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min to remove the
precipitates and dialyzed against the same buffer for 24 h
at 4 °C. Continuously, the dialyzed sample was further
brought to 50 % (w/v) saturation with ammonium sulfate
and precipitated overnight at 4 °C. The precipitate was
then collected by centrifugation at 13, 000 rpm for
30 min, dissolved, and replaced with the same buffer
using Amicon ultra filters ranging from 30 to 100 K
(Millipore Ireland Ltd, Ireland). The dialyzed solution
(22 mL) loaded onto a column (2.8 9 30 cm) of DEAESepharose (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) was equilibrated with 25 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing
10 mM sodium chloride. The purity and apparent molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated by
Superdex 75 10/300 GL column chromatography and
SDS-PAGE analysis, using a 4–25 % gradient polyacrylamide gel and stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue or a
silver staining kit (ELPIS Biotech Inc., Taejon, Korea).
The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined using
a known standard protein molecular weight marker ranging from 10 to 120-kDa protein ladder (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The concentration of the
purified enzyme was determined according to the method
of Bradford using BSA as standard [13].
Protease assays
ProA activity was measured by using skim milk, casein,
and gelatin as the substrate. The reaction mixture contained
1.0 mL of 25 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.5), 0.01 mL of
enzyme solution, and 10 mg of substrate. Incubation was

Bioprocess Biosyst Eng (2016) 39:307–314

309

carried out at 37 °C for 30 min with constant agitation at
150 rpm. The enzyme reaction was quenched by the
addition of 0.5 mL of 10 % (w/v) TCA and then kept on
ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for
10 min, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at
280 nm. One unit (U) of ProA activity was estimated as an
increase in absorbency of 0.1 at 280 nm under the standard
conditions for the assay.

Statistical analysis

Effects of pH and temperature on ProA activity

Results and discussion

For measurement of the optimum pH of ProA activity,
the enzyme activity was estimated using casein as substrate at 37 °C at various pHs ranging from pH 3.0 to
6.0, using 50 mM acetate buffer, pH 6.0–8.0 using
50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0–10.0 using
50 mM sodium borate, and pH 10.0–11.0 using 50 mM
sodium carbonate, respectively. The optimum temperature ProA activity was measured by performing the
enzyme reaction at temperatures between 20 and 60 °C
in Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.5). For thermo-stability of
ProA, the enzyme was incubated at 60 °C for 1 h and
the residual activity retained was measured at the optimum temperature.

Identification of proteolytic strain

Results obtained from the experiments were expressed as
the mean ± SD, unless representative data were indicated
as the means of averages from the experiments. P values
obtained from the experiments less than 0.05 were considered significant.

The kinetic constants, Km and Vmax, were calculated using
Woolf–Augustinsson–Hofstee plot, as described in the
previous study [14]. Effects of detergents, such as DMSO,
EDTA, Triton X-100, and SDS and divalent metal ions, on
ProA activity were tested; detergents were added to a final
concentration of 0.1–5.0 % and at a concentration of
1.0 mM.

To expand the effective utilization and enzymatic processing of protease (ProA), we have isolated and identified
a gram-negative marine microbial strain Marinomonas
arctica from sea–soil called Getpearl collected in InCheoncity, South Korea. Among nine different types of strains
which appeared on the solid-agar plate containing skim
milk, one named as PT-1 was further selected as for the
strongest ProA-producing strain. Consequently, the action
of ProA may be directly related to the degradation of skim
milk used as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, as shown
in Fig. 1a. Interestingly, the bacterium PT-1 was able to
degrade colloidal chitin used as a substrate to elucidate
other biological activity of PT-1 (see Fig. 1b). The bacterial strain PT-1 that showed the highest protease activity
was further isolated and characterized to be a Gram-negative, short rod, with a single-long polar flagellum as
shown by a TEM (see Fig. 1c). As earlier studies demonstrated, the high number and phylogenetic diversity of
bacterial strains collected in different seasons were
observed in the phylogenetic composition differences of
sea bacterial communities [15, 16]. The various species

chitin (a) and skim milk (b) for chitinolytic and proteolytic enzymes,

respectively, at 37 °C, for 3 days. The proteolytic bacterium M.

at 80 kV using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (c)

isolated from the sea-ice or arctic sea-ice known to date
were routinely grown at between 20 and 27 °C. Upon the
culture of the strain PT-1 in the presence of NaCl or KCl
ranged from 0 to 20 % in the culture media to assess the
salt resistance, maximal growth 5.0 % NaCl, with a wide
range from 2.5 to 10 % was observed (data not shown).
These results indicate that the strain PT-1 is one of the
halophilic marine bacteria. Taken together, PT-1 strain,
deposited in the Korean Type Culture Collection under the
accession number KCTC 12465BP, was first identified and
characterized as a strain for a serine protease and chitinsolytic enzyme producer associated with the viability of
bacterial counts under halotolerant conditions.
16S rDNA sequence and phylogenetic tree analysis
A potent ProA producer PT-1 was identified and characterized based on the gene 16S rDNA sequences with
phylogenetic tree analysis (see Fig. 2). The blast search of
939 bp of 16S rDNA gene from the strain PT-1 indicated
98.1 % pair-wise similarity toward the species of Marinomonas. Based on the blast search, we found that PT-1
exhibited over 96.7–97.9 % sequence similarity with the
partial sequences of various microbial strains such as M.
pollencensis [17], M. arctica [18], and M. pontica [19].

These results indicate that the strain PT-1 has considerable sequence homology with a wide variety of Marinomonas species, no particular genus of Marinomonas
species has been exploited for the production of halophilic
protease with wide variety of substrate specificities. In
addition, it is worthy to note that the strain PT-1 can
actively hydrolyze skim milk, casein, and gelatin used as
protein sources at 4 °C, suggesting that PT-1 is thus a
potentially important source for cold-active or coldadaptive proteases.
Fatty acid composition of M. arctica PT-1
Bacterial lipid membranes are widely used as important
indicators for the classification of the bacterial cell type.
Our results show that the fatty acid composition of M.
arctica PT-1 consists of C16:0 and C-18:1 accounting for
approximately 96 % in total fatty acids as major fatty
acids, and of these about 36 % were isomers (see Table 1).
These results quite differ from other data base obtained
from Pseudoalteromonas [20, 21], Bacillus [22], and
Marinomonas species [17, 18] known as proteolytic
enzyme producers. Taken together, based on the results of
16S rRNA sequence, phylogenetic tree, and major fatty
acid composition analyses, we concluded that M. arctica

PT-1 can be classified as a novel marine bacterial strain
isolated as a specific ProA producer.
Enzyme purification
An extracellular ProA was partially purified from the culture filtrate of M. arctica PT-1. (see Table 2). Molecular
weight of the purified ProA from the culture filtrate of M.
arctica PT-1 was determined to be about 63-kDa by silver
staining as major bands (Fig. 3). It is worthy to note that
our study provides the first report on the production and
purification of a native Marinomonas arctica’s proteolytic
enzyme.

activity at 37 °C, and the enzyme activity retained similar
activity up to 64 °C. Also 50 % of relative activity was
retained after incubation at 50 °C for 2 h tested under the
standard assay. Of note, considering about the wide variety
of substrate specificities such as skim milk, casein, and
gelatin used as protein sources at even 4 and 64 °C, our
results suggest that M. arctica PT-1 is a potentially
important source for cold-adaptive proteases with its thermal stability.

Optimum pH and temperature of ProA
The effect of pH on ProA activity was investigated under
varying pH values ranging from 3 to 11. Optimum pH of
the purified ProA toward skim milk showed a typical bellshaped curve with the maximum activity at pH 8.0 in
20 mM Tris–HCl buffer. These results suggest that the
purified ProA in this study was confirmed as alkalophilic
protease, which has been extensively studied by many
researchers due to its importance in industries [8, 23]. In
addition, the partially purified ProA showed an optimum

inhibitors at varying concentrations of 0.1–4 mM. Purified
ProA was completely inhibited by the cocktail containing
different protease inhibitors including serine protease
inhibitor PMSF, and cysteine protease inhibitors such as
chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A. However, no
significant inhibitory activity by chymostatin, leupeptin,
and pepstatin A was observed, when these reagents
(0.1 mM) were used individually. Only PMSF, which
completely inhibited enzyme activity, clearly indicates that
the purified ProA from M. arctica PT-1 is a serine protease.
Similar response to PMSF was reported for the keratinases
[22, 24] and some of the bacterial proteases from Bacillus
species [25]. Subsequently, since no inhibition of the ProA
activity with chymostatin even at 0.1 mM was observed,
these results suggest that cysteine residues may not be
possibly involved in the catalytic process of the degradation of outsourcing protein (see Table 3).
In addition, about 30 % of enzyme activity decreased by
addition of Triton X-100 and DMSO at 5 %, whereas, SDS
showed of 82.3 % inhibitory activity at 0.5 % concentration when skim milk was used as substrate, not for gelatin.
These results demonstrate that enzyme activity of ProA in
the presence of EDTA or SDS is obviously depending on
the primary structure of substrate which may affect the
mode of enzyme actions. Additionally, effect of various

metal ions at 1 mM on the ProA activity was investigated.
Among the metal ions tested, Mn2? significantly inhibited
about 67 % of enzyme activity, whereas the ProA was
found to be stable toward most of the metal ions tested
compared to the control. The decreased ProA activity by
the divalent metal ion Mn2? may be due to its role in
destabilizing complex of enzyme (see Table 4).
Kinetic parameters
The Km and Vmax values of enzyme activity toward skim
milk and gelatin were determined to be 1.16 9 10-3 mg/
mL and 7 9 10-5 U, and 7.60 9 10-4 mg/mL and
0.2 9 10-3 U, respectively (see Fig. 4a, b). The observed
Km value of this enzyme for gelatin was found to be higher
than that of the Km values of skim milk, casein, and azocasein used as substrates, respectively. These values indicated that ProA has a relatively high affinity toward gelatin
for the substrate, since it needed a much lower concentration of substrate. Since proteolytic products are commercially important bioactive materials especially in
functional foods [26, 27], nutraceuticals [27], and pharmaceuticals [28], further studies will be set to elucidate the
ecological and physiological significances of the isolate M.
arctica PT-1 to apply in biotechnology. Overall, our results
provide evidence to support the further investigation of
proteases for producing bioactive peptides for developing
an alternative biological tool useful in controlling and
maintaining food quality.

Conclusions
In this paper, isolation and production of a serine protease
from a marine bacterial strain was proposed. The strain
named as PT-1 was isolated and deposited as a novel
species of the genus Marinomonas based on molecular
characterization of 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic
tree, and fatty acid composition analyses. A serine protease
from the genus Marinomonas was purified and kinetically

process that could efficiently produce and utilize the

Marinomonas species.

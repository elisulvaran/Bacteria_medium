As wild fish stocks decline worldwide, land-based fish rearing is likely to be of increasing
relevance to feeding future human generations. Little is known about the structure and
role of microbial communities in fish aquaculture, particularly at larval developmental
stages where the fish microbiome develops and host animals are most susceptible to
disease. We employed next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S rRNA gene reads
amplified from total community DNA to reveal the structure of bacterial communities in a
gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) larviculture system. Early- (2 days after hatching) and
late-stage (34 days after hatching) fish larvae presented remarkably divergent bacterial
consortia, with the genera Pseudoalteromonas, Marinomonas, Acinetobacter, and
Acidocella (besides several unclassified Alphaproteobacteria) dominating the former, and
Actinobacillus, Streptococcus, Massilia, Paracoccus, and Pseudomonas being prevalent
in the latter. A significant reduction in rearing-water bacterial diversity was observed
during the larviculture trial, characterized by higher abundance of the Cryomorphaceae
family (Bacteroidetes), known to populate microniches with high organic load, in
late-stage rearing water in comparison with early-stage rearing-water. Furthermore, we
observed the recruitment, into host tissues, of several bacterial phylotypes—including
putative pathogens as well as mutualists—that were detected at negligible densities in
rearing-water or in the live feed (i.e., rotifers and artemia). These results suggest that,
besides host-driven selective forces, both the live feed and the surrounding rearing
environment contribute to shaping the microbiome of farmed gilthead sea-bream larvae,
and that a differential establishment of host-associated bacteria takes place during larval
development.

The Bacteriome of Fish Larvae

INTRODUCTION

(Llewellyn et al., 2014). Early molecular surveys based on
fingerprinting techniques, such as PCR-DGGE and T-RFLP have
enabled a broader characterization of microbial assemblages
in farmed fish to be made than previous studies relying
on microbial cultivation-dependent methods, revealing the
predominance of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes
in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of fish (Pond et al., 2006;
Hovda et al., 2007; Nayak, 2010). Recent NGS assessments of
the fish microbiome not only have continued to focus on the
GI apparatus (gut, intestine and their contents) of adult fish
(Rurangwa et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2016),
improving our knowledge of the microbiome of commercially
valuable teleost species, such as trout, carp, sturgeon and cod (see
Llewellyn et al., 2014 for a comprehensive review). They have
also enabled novel insights into the microbiota of fish juveniles
(Bakke et al., 2015; Giatsis et al., 2015; Rurangwa et al., 2015).
The first demonstration of bacteria adhering to fish eggs dates
back 60 years ago (Oppenheimer, 1955), and the importance of
early-stage microbes to fish survival, development and disease
susceptibility is well-known (Hansen and Olafsen, 1999; Olafsen,
2001; Vadstein et al., 2013). Recent molecular-based studies
have enabled a better circumscription of the bacterial consortia
associated with, for instance, cod larvae (Bakke et al., 2013, 2015),
but comprehensive knowledge of the structure of microbial
communities (especially regarding the identity of their dominant
and rare members) relevant to intensive fish larviculture still
needs to be determined for a wide range of economically
important species. In this study, we used a trans-disciplinary
approach, coupling state-of-the-art fish larviculture to NGS
taxonomic profiling of bacterial communities, to delineate
the autochthonous bacterial consortium of farmed gilthead
seabream larvae, and to reveal the participation of exogenous
microorganisms in shaping this consortium. We determine
bacterial community composition and diversity during a gilthead
seabream larval rearing trial using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S
rRNA genes amplified from the metagenomes of (1) fish larvae
at early [2 days after hatching (DAH)] and late (34 DAH)
developmental stages, (2) their live feed, and (3) rearingwater.

Fish farming is the fastest-growing segment within the global
agribusiness, with a compound annual growth rate of 9% (FAO,
2014). Currently, worldwide production of farmed fish totals 70.5
million tons per year vs. 93.7 million tons of wild captures. Sparus
aurata (gilthead seabream) is the third most cultivated marine
fish species worldwide, with around 160,000 tons produced
every year (FAO, 2012). Most of the gilthead seabream farming
takes place in southern European countries (Greece, Italy, Spain,
Portugal and France) and Turkey, and the fish is exported,
chiefly within the European market, as a highly valuable reared
species (FAO, 2012). Even though the efficiency of rearing adults
from larvae is increasing, land-based fish larviculture remains a
major production bottleneck keeping fish farming output below
market expectations. Mortality rates in fish aquaculture during
the first 30 days after egg hatching usually range from 80 to even
100% of the initial pool of hatched larvae (Uribe et al., 2011;
Vadstein et al., 2013). Besides the typical r-selection strategy of
most fish species, characterized by high reproductive recruitment
but low survival of the young, high mortality rates observed
in fish larviculture are believed to result from greater disease
incidence caused by opportunistic/pathogenic bacteria (Olafsen,
2001; Hache and Plante, 2011; Vadstein et al., 2013). This
hypothesis has propelled much research on the improvement
of fish larvae well-being in aquaculture (Bergh, 2000; Bachère,
2003; Kesarcodi-Watson et al., 2008; Vadstein et al., 2013). Most
of the efforts in this regard have focused on the manipulation
of existing microbiota and/or enhancing disinfection protocols–
e.g., through the use of few culturable, pre- and probiotic
bacteria - and on the treatment, cleaning or circulation of
the rearing water (Makridis et al., 2005; Sáenz De Rodrigáñez
et al., 2009; Conceição et al., 2010; Attramadal et al., 2012).
Yet wider exploitation of the entire aquaculture microbiota for
improved fish rearing, although desirable, remains difficult owing
to our limited view of the identity and activity of the majority
of microorganisms that mediate nutrient cycling and disease
incidence in land-based fish farming. In fact, the diversity and
function of free-living and host-associated microorganisms in
fish larviculture has seldom been investigated, constituting a
true gap of knowledge not only in aquaculture (Vadstein et al.,
2013) but also in fish physiology, developmental and microbiome
research. This hinders our understanding of the establishment of
microbial communities in early fish developmental stages, and
thus a more comprehensive perspective of fish biology in the
light of its associated microbiome. Moreover, it also hampers
our ability to mitigate the losses presumably caused by harmful
microorganisms in intensive fish aquaculture.
The application of next-generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies to the study of host-associated microorganisms
is spurring significant advances in our understanding of
symbiotic relationships and metazoan evolution (Rosenberg
et al., 2007; Consortium, 2012; Hentschel et al., 2012; Egan
et al., 2013; McFall-Ngai, 2014). Fish microbiome research is
currently gaining momentum although it may be considered
relatively incipient in comparison with the existing body of
knowledge on well-studied hosts, such as humans and plants

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Rearing of Gilthead Seabream Larvae
Gilthead seabream larvae were reared at the Aquaculture
Research Station (EPPO) of the Portuguese Institute for the Sea
and the Atmosphere (IPMA), hereafter termed “EPPO-IPMA,”
using methods that were similar to production-scale procedures
(Ferreira, 2009). To rear the larvae until their mature stage, an
experimentally controlled flow-through system was employed.
Water temperature (19.2 ± 1.23◦ C), salinity (36 ± 1 psu) and
dissolved oxygen (7.0 ± 1.05 mg/L) were kept stable throughout
the experiment, and light intensity was set at approximately 800
lux within a photoperiod of 14 h light (starting at 9 am) and
10 h dark. Water renewal rate ranged from 20 to 45% per h
depending on the type of prey used for feeding (see below),
draining through an 80 µm to a 500 µm mesh (Castanho, 2014).

tanks) was applied using a mixture of Nannochloropsis oculata
(1.2 × 105 cells. mL−1 ) and Isochrysis aff. galbana (3.0 × 104
cells. mL−1 ) since mouth opening until the end of the trial,
totalizing 1.5 × 105 microalgal cells. mL−1 added daily to the
rearing tanks. Shortly, this technique helps maintaining live feed
nutritional profiles. Castanho (2014) performed assessments of
larval wellbeing during the course of the experiment, including
larval survival, growth, morphology and development. Fish
larvae survival (16.5 ± 2.72%) by the end of the experiment (35
DAH) was considered satisfactory (Castanho, 2014).

well interconnected with coastal seawater, was used as the source
of water entering the system.
Gilthead seabream eggs were obtained from broodstock
under captivity at EPPO-IPMA, and incubated at 18 ± 0.5◦ C
in 200 L cylindro-conical fiberglass tanks at a density of 0.5
g.L −1 for 2 days. One day after hatching, fish larvae were
distributed across four independent rearing tanks (200 L) at
a density of 100 larvae.L −1 . Only live feed was provided to
the larvae during the entire rearing period, which comprised
35 days from egg hatching to complete organs’ development.
Larvae were fed rotifers (Brachionus spp.) and artemia (Artemia
sp., nauplii and metanauplii stages) in accordance with larval
developmental stage and mouth size (Figure 1, see details below).
While rotifers were produced using a batch culture system
established at EPPO-IPMA (Ferreira, 2009), artemia nauplii and
metanauplii were obtained from Viet Nam Brine Shrimp (VNBS,
Golden Lotus Trading LLC, USA) and from Salt Lake Aquafeed
(Catvis BV, The Netherlands), respectively. After decapsulation
(Ferreira, 2009), artemia cysts were incubated at a density of 4
cysts. mL−1 at 27◦ C and 27 psu under strong aeration. While
artemia nauplii were harvested at hatching to be directly used
as food, artemia metanauplii were harvested at hatching to be
nutritionally enriched prior to larvae provision. Both rotifers and
artemia metanauplii were enriched with the commercial product
RedPepper R (Bernaqua NV, Belgium) following the supplier’s
recommendations for each. Prior to feeding, rotifer and artemia
pools were washed with flow-through seawater to minimize the
input of allochtonous organic material into the tanks. Rotifers
were provided to larvae from 4 DAH (when the latter opened
their mouth) until 19 DAH. Artemia nauplii were given from
15 DAH until 19 DAH, and metanauplii from 20 DAH until
the end of the rearing trial (34 DAH, Figure 1). Live preys were
provided ad libitum, with a minimum concentration of c. five
rotifers and one artemia nauplii. mL−1 to compensate for the
restricted larval mobility at the earliest developmental stages. The
“green water technique” (addition of microalgae to the rearing

Bacterial Community Profiling: Sampling
and Total Community DNA Extraction
The sampling scheme used for bacterial community profiling
is depicted in Figure 1. Five host- and particle-associated
microhabitats were inspected for bacterial community diversity
and composition using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA
gene reads amplified from “total community” DNA (TC-DNA)
samples. The microhabitats were (1) rearing-water from 2 and
34 DAH, (2) gilthead seabream larvae from 2 and 34 DAH,
(3) rotifers, (4) artemia nauplii and (5) artemia metanauplii,
totalizing seven hereafter called “sample categories” to include
the temporal analysis (2 DAH vs. 34 DAH) of water and larvae
microhabitats. Either three or four independent replicate samples
were used in the characterization of each sample category
(Figure 1).
Rearing-water samples consisted of 2 L volumes taken
separately from each of the four experimental tanks at 2
and 34 DAH using disinfected (70% ethanol) plastic beakers,
thereby comprising four independent replicates from each
sampling point. Rearing-water samples were first passed through
a disinfected 150 µM nylon mesh, and then filtered through
0.22 µM pore-sized nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) with the aid of a vacuum pump. Filters were stored
at −80◦ C until TC-DNA extraction. Active gilthead seabream

place using the PCR Master Mix Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden,
Germany), containing 2.5 units Taq DNA polymerase, 1.5 mM
MgCl2 , 1X QIAGEN PCR Buffer and 0.2 mM dNTPs (final
concentrations), to which 0.2 µM of each primer were added.
Each sample was tagged by different 8-mer barcodes attached
to the reverse primer (Appendix S1, Supplementary Material).
Thermal cycling involved a touchdown procedure to improve the
retrieval of amplicons of the correct size (especially needed for
16S rRNA gene amplification from TC-DNA of 2 DAH larvae),
with initial denaturation at 94◦ C for 4 min, followed by 10 cycles
of 30 s at 94◦ C, 45 s at 65–55◦ C and 1 min at 68◦ C. Further
20 cycles followed as described above, except for the use of a
constant annealing temperature of 55◦ C and a final elongation
step at 68◦ C for 10 min. Two 25 µL amplifications were carried
out per sample. The final 50 µL amplicon mixtures of each
sample were delivered for pyrosequencing on a 454 Genome
Sequencer GS FLX Titanium platform (Roche Diagnostics Ltd,
West Sussex, UK) at Genoinseq (Biotechnology Innovation
Center, Cantanhede, Portugal). For more details on sequencing
procedures, see Appendix S1.
Processing and analysis of 454 pyrosequencing data followed
the approach and scripts of Hardoim and Costa (2014) and
Hardoim et al. (2014), with a few modifications. In summary,
raw data were handled with AmpliconNoise (Quince et al.,
2011) for the stringent retrieval of high-quality sequences
and removal of homopolymers and chimeras. Sequences were
subsequently trimmed using Galaxy (http://usegalaxy.org/) to
obtain reads between 150 and 260 bp in length. Processing of
quality-filtered sequences was performed with the Quantitative
Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software package
(Caporaso et al., 2010). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
were defined at ≥97% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity using
the UCLUST method (Edgar, 2010). Representative sequences
of each OTU were picked using QIIME default parameters,
and aligned employing Infernal (Nawrocki et al., 2009) using
a STOCKHOLM file of pre-aligned sequences and secondary
structures. Taxonomic assignment of representative sequences
was carried out with the BLAST taxonomy assigner method using
the latest Greengenes database (release 13_05) within the QIIME
environment. After OTUs unclassifiable at the domain level or
identified as mitochondria and chloroplasts were removed, a final
OTU vs. samples table was generated and used for downstream
analyses. These comprised (i) estimates of bacterial richness
(Chao1) and diversity (Shannon’s index) across microhabitats,
(ii) phylum- and genus-level bacterial composition in individual
and pooled samples per microhabitat, (iii) determination of
OTUs specific to and shared by microhabitats using Venn
diagrams, and (iv) multivariate analysis of OTU data. The
latter was performed via UPGMA clustering and Principal
Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of OTU profiles using both the
weighted and unweighted Unifrac metric. Analyses (i) to (iv)
were undertaken using two datasets, with and without singleton
OTUs, and results from the first dataset are shown unless
otherwise stated. We used size-normalized sample libraries to
perform analyses (i), (ii), and (iv), whereas the exploration of the
full (non-normalized) quality-filtered dataset was employed in
Venn Diagram constructions, and to create absolute abundance

larvae were also harvested at 2 and 34 DAH. Each sample
consisted of about 0.2 g (wet weight) larval pools, corresponding
to approximately 50 larvae from 2 DAH and 6 larvae from 34
DAH, respectively, taken from each of the four experimental
rearing tanks using a disinfected 150 µM nylon mesh. Larval
pools were gently rinsed three times with sterile artificial seawater
to remove microbial cells not firmly attached to the larvae. Larval
samples (independent replicates from 2 and 34 DAH, Figure 1)
were then transferred to sterile, 2 mL polypropylene tubes
and stored at −80◦ C until TC-DNA extraction. To determine
the structure of bacterial communities added each day to the
rearing tanks through the provision of feed organisms, three
independent replicates of the live feed were sampled (prior to
their introduction to the tanks), at random days during the
rearing trial (depiction of live feed collection dates was simplified
in Figure 1 for the sake of clarity). Live feed replicate samples
consisted of 0.2 g pools of each rotifers, artemia nauplii and
metanauplii placed into sterile, 2 mL polypropylene tubes after
harvesting with disinfected beakers and gentle rinsing (3x) with
sterile artificial seawater. Samples were kept at −80◦ C until
TC-DNA extraction.
TC-DNA extraction from all sample categories was carried
out using the Ultra Clean R Soil DNA isolation kit (MO
BIO Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA). For rearing-water
samples, filters obtained as above were first cut into smaller pieces
with sterile scissors prior to TC-DNA extraction following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Larvae, rotifer and artemia (nauplii
and metanauplii) samples were first thoroughly homogenized
in 500 µL artificial sterile seawater using a 10 cm3 PotterElvehjem PTFE pestle and glass tube (Scherf-Präzision Europa
GmbH, Meiningen, Germany) before being subjected to TCDNA extraction. Here, an enzymatic lysis step was introduced
after mechanical shearing—via bead beating—of the sample
material to enable higher DNA yields. This consisted of two
successive, 1 h incubation periods with 10 mg/mL lysozyme
(Merck-Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 37◦ C (Pangastuti et al.,
2010) and 2 mg/mL proteinase K (Merck-Millipore) at 55◦ C
(Sáenz De Rodrigáñez et al., 2009; Bakke et al., 2013).

Bacterial Community Profiling: 454
Pyrosequencing and Data Processing
For bar-coded 454 pyrosequencing, a nested PCR approach was
employed to enable standardized 16S rRNA gene amplification
from all TC-DNA samples, including 2 DAH fish larvae which
presented the lowest DNA yields. In the first PCR, c. 10 ng
template DNA were used for the amplification of near full-length
bacterial 16S rRNA genes using 30 thermal cycles and the
universal primer pair F27 (AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG)—
R1492 (TACGGYTACCTTGTTACACTT) (Weisburg et al.,
1991), as described elsewhere (Hardoim et al., 2012).
The resulting amplicons (2 µL) were used as template
in a second PCR with the Ribosomal Database Project
(RDP) primer set (V4_titF-AYTGGGYDTAAAGNG and
V4_titR-TACNVRRGTHTCTAATYC), which targets the V4
hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, generating
amplicons of around 248 bp in length. PCR amplification took

mitochondria, resulted in a total of 80,353 reads that constituted
the analytical dataset. Altogether, these high-quality sequences
were assigned to 1,953 OTUs at a 97% gene similarity cut-off,
including 1,068 singleton OTUs classifiable at least at the Domain
level (Table S1). These comprised 1.33% of the total number of
analyzed reads.

ranks of OTUs per sample categories and across the whole
dataset. The taxonomy of the most differentiating OTUs (see
below) was verified and refined, if needed, using the latest SILVA
database (version 123.1 of March 29 2016, http://www.arb-silva.
de/download/archive/release_123_1) and custom phylogenetic
assessments within the software package ARB (Ludwig et al.,
2004) as reported elsewhere (Costa et al., 2013; Keller-Costa et al.,
2014).
Sequencing data were deposited in the European Nucleotide
Archive (ENA) under the study accession number PRJEB9367,
with sample accession numbers ERS726185-ERS726201 (hostassociated samples) and ERS726303–ERS726310 (rearing-water
samples). A sample vs. quality-filtered OTUs table with the
corresponding taxonomic assignment of each OTU, including
singleton OTUs with verified phylogenetic validity, is provided
as Supplementary Material (Table S1, Supplementary Material).

Bacterial Richness and Diversity
Differences in bacterial richness were statistically significant
among the seven inspected sample categories (One Way
ANOVA, P < 0.001, DF = 23, Figure 2A), with rearingwater samples displaying significantly higher values than hostassociated samples (Figure 2A). Of note was a striking decrease
in rearing-water bacterial richness during the trial, with averages
(± standard deviation) of 286.5 ± 55.45 vs. 134.75 ± 34.05
OTUs detected per sample at 2 DAH and 34 DAH, respectively
(Holm-Sidak t = 5.982, P < 0.001). In contrast, a subtle, nonsignificant (Holm-Sidak t = 2.371, P = 0.06) increase in richness
was observed for fish larvae from 2 DAH (40 ± 10.14 OTUs)
to 34 DAH (53.75 ± 7 OTUs) (Figure 2A). The live feed of fish
larvae—rotifers, artemia nauplii and metanauplii—were similar
in terms of bacterial richness (pairwise Holm-Sidak t < 1.830,
P > 0.08, Figure 2A). Chao1 richness estimates retrieved for
both 2 DAH and 34 DAH rearing-water were about 3-fold
higher than the corresponding, observed bacterial richness values
(Figure 2A). The difference between observed and estimated
richness was not as pronounced, and often negligible, for the
host-associated bacterial communities (Figure 2A). As expected
due to their high richness values, bacterial communities from 2
and 34 DAH tank water were the most susceptible to the removal
of singleton OTUs (Table 1, Figure 2B), averaging 193.5 ± 41.16
and 97.25 ± 25.90 OTUs per sample, respectively (Figure 2B).
Reduction in richness values were not as pronounced in hostassociated samples (Figure 2B) and, in comparative terms, both
datasets with and without singletons revealed the same trends
concerning shifts in bacterial richness across sample categories
(Figures 2A,B). Shannon diversity indices—which consider not
only the number of bacterial phylotypes (i.e., OTUs) but also
their relative abundances in each sample—obtained for fish
larvae (2 and 34 DAH) were, usually, significantly higher than
those registered for the live feed (Figure 2C), suggesting greater
equitability among community members in fish larvae than in
the live feed. Further, at 34 DAH bacterial community diversity
in the rearing-water was even lower than fish larvae diversity
(Holm-Sidak t = 3.247, P = 0.005; Figure 2C) in spite of the
much higher richness values registered for 34 DAH rearingwater in comparison with larvae (Figure 2A). Diversity estimates
did not change significantly after removal of singleton OTUs
(Figure 2C).

Statistical Analyses
Normality (Shapiro-Wilk) and equal variance tests were
performed to inspect the distribution of the OTU richness and
diversity measures, as well as of relative abundance values of
the most dominant bacterial phyla and genera found across the
seven sample categories, all estimated from 454-pyrosequencing
data. One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed
on log-transformed alpha diversity measures (OTU richness,
Chao1 and Shannon indices), all of which showing normal
data distributions, to test whether mean values obtained for all
sample groups were equal, followed by all pair-wise multiple
comparison procedures using the Holm-Sidak method to
determine significance between groups, in our case the seven
sample categories. The Kruskal-Wallis test (One-Way ANOVA
on Ranks) was employed to test whether the relative abundances
of the most dominant bacterial phyla and genera changed
significantly across the seven sample categories, given the
absence of normal data distributions in most cases. A posthoc Dunn’s test was used to verify differences among sample
categories in a pair-wise manner. Analyses were conducted
using SigmaPlot 11 (Systat Software Inc., London, UK).
Jackknifed beta-diversity procedures were run within the QIIME
environment (jackknifed_beta_diversity.py) to test the statistical
validity of sample groups generated by cluster and ordination
(PCoA) analyses of OTU data, and thus whether bacterial
community profiles generated by 454 pyrosequencing could
discriminate between the seven sample categories defined in this
study. The Similarity Percentage (SIMPER) test (Clarke, 1993)
was run on PAST software (Hammer et al., 2001) version 3.10
to identify which bacterial OTUs contributed the most to the
(Bray-Curtis) dissimilarities observed among microhabitats.

was apparently (see below) a characteristic phylum of early-stage
fish larvae (2 DAH), occurring also–at moderate levels (2.70 ±
1.40%)—in artemia nauplii samples. In 2 DAH larvae, GN02 was
represented mainly by one single OTU (OTU 2192, Table S1)
and displayed high variability in relative abundance among
samples (11.89 ± 18.83%, Figure 3A), showing therefore an
inconsistent pattern of occurrence in this sample category.
The proportions mentioned above remained largely unchanged
when we explored relative abundances of phyla using the
non-normalized dataset (Table 1).
The composition of the most dominant bacterial genera
and unclassified families was markedly different among sample
categories (Figure 3B), with relative abundances showing
greater variations than could be predicted by chance (KruskalWallis, overall P < 0.007, DF = 6. See Table S2 for details). A
reduction in the number of genera was observed in rearing-water
samples during the trial, coinciding with observations made
at the OTU level (Figure 2). Indeed, most of the Bacteroidetes

expected by chance across the seven sample categories (KruskalWallis, overall P < 0.03, DF = 6, Figure 3A. See Table S2,
Supplementary Material, for details). Proteobacteria was clearly
the dominant phylum in larvae- (2 and 34 DAH), rotifers-, and
artemia metanauplii-associated bacterial communities, with
average relative abundances of 83.81 ± 17.8%, 76.44 ± 2.25%,
95.46 ± 0.80%, and 91.07 ± 3.68%, respectively. Conversely,
shared dominance between Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria
was observed in 2 DAH rearing-water (50.49 ± 8.25% and
43.38 ± 7.31%, respectively) and artemia nauplii (61.33 ± 1.65%
and 34.57 ± 0.96%, respectively) samples (Figure 3A). A
marked shift in community composition at the phylum level was
registered for rearing-water during the trial as high Bacteroidetes
dominance (87.39 ± 5.02%) was observed at 34 DAH. In
fish larvae we detected a pronounced increase in Firmicutes
abundance from 2 (3.82 ± 5.27%) to 34 DAH (19.55 ± 3.51%,
Figure 3A). Finally, the until-recently candidate phylum GN02,
now formally recognized as Gracilibacteria (Rinke et al., 2013),

Ordination of Bacterial OTUs

larvae corresponded to low or only moderately abundant OTUs
across the data (Tables S4, S5), four of the 10 most abundant
OTUs in the dataset (Table 2) were common to fish larvae and
rearing-water samples. While OTUs 1296 (Pseudoalteromonas)
and 2374 (Paracoccus) appeared to be enriched in 2 and
34 DAH fish larvae, respectively, presenting only very low
numbers in the corresponding rearing-water samples, OTUs
268 (Cryomorphaceae) and 708 (Rhodobacteraceae) occurred in
higher abundance in rearing-water, and thus appeared to be deselected in the fish host (Table 2, Tables S4, S5). Further, the
divergence between bacterial community structures in rearingwater from 2 and 34 DAH (see e.g., Figure 4) was also well
illustrated, as a much larger pool of bacterial OTUs specific
to, than shared by, both sample categories could be depicted
(Figure 5A). The dichotomy between 2 and 34 DAH larvaeassociated bacterial communities was also evident, as only 24
OTUs were common to both sample categories, while 58 and
110 OTUs from 2 and 34 DAH larvae, respectively, remained
exclusive to each (Figure 5A).
To more specifically address the relative contribution of
live feed and rearing-water as bacterial vectors for mature fish
larvae, a Venn diagram was constructed using OTUs detected
in the live feed (pooling of rotifers and artemia nauplii and
metanauplii samples), 34 DAH rearing-water, and 34 DAH fish
larvae as discrete OTU pools (Figure 5B). We further built
one diagram in which the live feed was divided into rotifers,
artemia nauplii and artemia metanauplii as single categories to
determine their own unique contribution to shaping bacterial
communities in 34 DAH larvae (Figure 5C). We found that
a minority portion (36) of the OTUs documented in the live
feed was also present in fish larvae approaching the juvenile
stage (Figure 5B, Table S6, Supplementary Material), with only
10 such OTUs being simultaneously present in fish larvae and
each of the live feed used in larval rearing (Figure 5C, Table S6).
Nevertheless, we were able to single out several examples of
strong selection of bacterial phylotypes in fish larvae from
within this fraction of shared OTUs. This was certainly the
case for OTUs 928 (unclassified Oxalobacteraceae), 705 and
1953 (Pseudomonas), 84 (unclassified Enterobacteriaceae), 807

At the approximate “species” level of taxonomic resolution
(OTUs), Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) and Jackknifed
UPGMA clustering performed on weighted (Figures 4A,B)
and unweighted (Figures 4C,D) Unifrac measures were used
to inspect the continuous (PCoA) vs. discrete (UPGMA)
grouping of samples according to their degrees of OTUcommunity (dis)similarity. Altogether, these analyses revealed
discrete grouping of replicates from each sample category
into separate clusters with statistical support (Figures 4B,D),
corroborating trends revealed by genus-level inspection of
taxonomic composition (Figure 3B). The only exception to
discrete clustering per microhabitat was one replicate from
2 DAH larvae (2L4), which first grouped with one cluster
encompassing all rotifer replicates in the weighted cluster
analysis (Figure 4B). Although grouping patterns were the
same in both weighted and unweighted analysis, the extent
of dissimilarity between the sample categories was consistently
larger in the latter comparison. Trends revealed by community
ordination remained unchanged when analyses were undertaken
in the absence of singleton OTUs (Figure S1, Supplementary
Material).

Specific and Shared OTUs across
Microhabitats
To determine how many and which OTUs were common
or specific to each sample category, we explored the full
(non-normalized) quality-filtered dataset using Venn diagrams
where replicate samples per category were pooled (Figure 5).
Quite surprisingly, only five bacterial OTUs were common
to all 2 and 34 DAH rearing-water and fish larvae sample
categories (Figure 5A). Larvae at 2 DAH hosted 29 specific
OTUs within these four sample categories and shared 39
bacterial OTUs with its primary surrounding environment, that
is, 2 DAH rearing-water (Figure 5A, Table S4, Supplementary
Material). Only 17 OTUs were common to 34 DAH larvae
and rearing-water from 696 OTUs detected in both sample
types (Figure 5A, Table S5, Supplementary Material). Although
several bacterial phylotypes shared by rearing-water and fish

Corresponding cluster analyses performed on Unifrac measures using the UPGMA algorithm are displayed next to the PCoA plots (B,D) to reveal the discrete
grouping of samples from the same similarity matrix. The robustness of the clusters was assessed by means of a jackknifed beta diversity permutation test and are

Because OTUs represented by one read are by definition
sample-specific, removal of singletons from the data led to
a substantial reduction in the number of OTUs exclusive to
each sample category, whereas the number of OTUs common

(Bradyrhizobium), 1387 (Sphingomonas), and 1970 (Acidocella).
All these OTUs displayed enhanced numbers in 34 DAH fish
larvae but occurred at very low abundances in the live feed

to all sample categories remained unchanged (Figures S2A–C).
However, the effect caused by singleton exclusion did not erode
the picture of a larger pool of OTUs specific to than shared by
sample categories (Figures S2A–C).

DISCUSSION
Bacterial communities in fish larviculture constitute a large
reservoir of genetic and metabolic diversity that should not be
undervalued in management practices. Indeed, in this study we
detected 1,953 OTUs in seven sample categories—all of which
characterized by highly distinct bacterial taxonomic profiles—
in a gilthead seabream hatchery. About 90% of the singleton
OTUs included in our analysis (Table S1), classified at least at
the Domain level with the BLAST taxonomy assigner, could as
well be classified as bacterial taxa using either the Greengenes
or SILVA assignment methods (verified on December 06 2016).
Encompassing 1,068 OTUs, these singletons represented a
significant fraction of the bacterial richness captured in this
survey, but a rather negligible proportion (1.3%) of the total
number of analyzed reads. Indeed, we found that several sample
categories, namely the live feed and 34 DAH rearing-water
bacterial communities, were dominated by very few bacterial
phylotypes (OTUs). In contrast, we verified that additional
bacterial richness is likely to be revealed especially in rearingwater samples if further sequencing effort is applied, as suggested
by the difference between observed and estimated richness
values obtained for these consortia (Figures 2A,B). Because
the methodology employed here enabled us to uncover highly
diverse bacterial consortia particularly in fish larvae and 2 DAH
rearing-water (and also in other marine symbiotic consortia–see
e.g., Hardoim et al. (2014), the lower diversity/high dominance
observed in the live feed and 34 DAH rearing-water is most
likely indicative of a non-natural pattern of bacterial community
structuring. This could result from strong selective pressures
exerted on microbial populations in severely manipulated
ecosystems. Rotifers and artemia used in fish larviculture are
commonly maintained in captivity under long-term, steady
conditions (e.g., kept in microalgal cultures at 15–18◦ C Ferreira,
2009). This is likely to reduce the diversity of their naturally
occurring microbial consortia, eventually contributing to the
prevalence of fewer microorganisms, in these hosts, that are
able to cope with the processing and maintenance procedures.
Our results contrast high bacterial richness measures obtained
elsewhere for the live feed used in cod larval rearing (Bakke
et al., 2015), likely reflecting the different sampling strategies
employed in these studies, since we opted for collecting the live
feed prior to their addition to the rearing tanks. The decrease
in bacterial diversity observed in 34 DAH rearing-water could
derive not only from the selection of populations performing
well under controlled parameters but also from the presumably
higher amounts of organic matter in larviculture tanks at late
rearing stages. Accumulation of larval metabolic waste products
via defecation, increase of dead biomass, be it from microalgae,
food items or the larvae themselves, and the density of the
microalgae daily applied to the rearing tanks may all contribute

less likely to possess crucial relevance to larval physiology and
metabolism since their occurrence in association with the host
was not favored.
Owing to the high-throughput nature of our analysis, we
were able to unmask several bacterial populations (OTUs) whose
distribution across the studied microhabitats exemplifies
a mode of bacterial acquisition characterized by sharp
enrichment, within host tissues, of otherwise extremely low
abundant populations in the live feed or in the environmental
surroundings. For instance, two Pseudomonas OTUs (705 and
1953) contribute to the quite high abundance of this genus in
mature fish larvae. They display close phylogenetic relationship
with P. fragi (Miller et al., 1973; Cormier et al., 1991) and
P. lini (Delorme et al., 2002), respectively, and extremely low
abundances in live feed samples (Table S1). Although the
life-strategy of P. fragi and relatives is suggestive of typical
opportunistic behavior with pathogenic potential, there is
currently no evidence for the participation of either P. fragi
and P. lini as aethiological agents of disease in fish. Likewise,
OTU 928 (family Oxalobacteraceae, order Burkholderiales)
(Baldani et al., 2014), was an abundant phylotype in 34 DAH
larvae also present in all artemia metanaupli replicates, albeit
at only negligible densities. The Oxalobacteraceae family is
metabolically diverse and includes strict anaerobes, aerobes,
and nitrogen-fixing organisms. Phylogenetic inference suggests
that OTU 928 is a member of the genus Massilia (Table S3), a
relatively widespread taxon registered in soils, soil crusts, air and
humans (La Scola et al., 1998; Ferrari et al., 2005; Gundlapally
and Garcia-Pichel, 2006; Kämpfer et al., 2011). Our results
indicate a classical enrichment of this phylotype in fish larvae
through live feed ingestion. Its prevalence at the later larval
stage is well justified by its presence in Artemia metanauplii
samples only, even if at low abundances. These data fit well
previous observations on the occurrence of Oxalobactaraceae
in the intestinal tract of sea bass juveniles (Carda-Dieguez
et al., 2014). A further dominant taxon in 34 DAH larvae,
which was however absent in all other microhabitats, the genus
Actinobacillus (Gammaproteobacteria, Pasteurellaceae) contains
species recognized as parasites or pathogens of mammals, birds
and reptiles (Slots and Ting, 1999; Kuhnert and Christensen,
2008; Macinnes et al., 2012). Actinobacillus spp. have already
been documented in aquaculture ponds (Ampofo and Clerk,
2003), and there is no current evidence of their role as fish
pathogens. Similarly, we observed two OTUs (1128 and 2143)
that primarily contribute to the abundance of the genus
Streptococcus (Firmicutes) in 34 DAH larvae, but were detected
neither in water nor in live feed samples. Several Streptococcus
spp. are known to cause disease in fish, and S. iniae is a leading
pathogen in aquaculture worldwide (Baiano and Barnes, 2009).
Phylogenetic inference indicates that our OTUs are more closely
related with the human pathogenic species S. dysgalactiae and
S. infantis/mitis (Table S3). Particularly, S. dysgalactiae has been
recently recognized as an emerging pathogen infecting a wide
variety of fish species (Abdelsalam et al., 2013), causing e.g.,
necrosis in the caudal peduncles and high mortality rates in
cultured amberjack (Seriola dumerili) and yellowtail (Seriola
quinqueradiata) (Nomoto et al., 2004). Because we did not

to higher loads of organic matter in fish farming (Vadstein
et al., 2013). In spite of the high water renewal rates employed
in our trial, all these increments influence the quality and
quantity of the dissolved and particulate organic matter present
in rearing tanks, thus most likely playing an important role in
the selection of (fewer) microorganisms prevailing under the
presumed, more eutrophic conditions at late larval rearing stages.
What highlights the reduction in bacterial diversity from 2 DAH
to 34 DAH rearing-water is an increase in abundance (from 21.8
to 71.6%, Figure 3, Table 2) of one single OTU affiliated with the
Cryomorphaceae family (Bacteroidetes). Members of this family
play a role in marine secondary production and require complex
carbon sources for growth, being usually found in association
with phytoplankton blooms and in environments rich in organic
carbon (Zhou et al., 2013; Bowman, 2014). Although not verified
experimentally, the increase in Cryomorphaceae in rearing-water
during the trial may correlate with the cumulative introduction
of microalgae to the tanks. Indeed, the total Cryomorphaceae
abundance in 2 DAH rearing-water (c. 23%) can already be
considered quite high, surpassing by 10-fold the amount of
Cryomorphaceae found in the natural input water (i.e., water
from the Ria Formosa lagoon, Olhão; Costa et al., unpublished
data).
Besides the rather sharp increase in abundance of
Cryomorphaceae in the rearing-water during the experiment,
several other OTUs could be identified as distinguishing
bacterial taxa among microhabitats. The genera Loktanella
(dominant in rotifers) and Paracoccus (dominant in artemia
metanauplii) are bacterial groups in the Rhodobacteraceae family
(Alphaproteobacteria) with potential probiotic activity (Hjelm
et al., 2004; Makridis et al., 2005; Yan et al., 2014). These taxa were
abundant in the live feed but were very scarce in rearing-water
and fish larvae. Higher Loktanella spp. proportions were found
on fronds of the macroalga Ulva australis than in seawater (Burke
et al., 2011), and they ranked as the prevailing culturable bacteria
associated with laboratory strains of microalgae (Schwenk et al.,
2014). It is possible, therefore, that Loktanella spp. accumulate
within rotifers after digestion of microalgae besides water
filtering with both processes playing a role in maintaining this
consistent association in fish larviculture. Besides its pronounced
dominance in artemia metanauplii, the genus Paracoccus was
quite abundant in artemia nauplii, but only moderately abundant
in 34 DAH larvae. The sole, but highly abundant, Paracoccus
phylotype (OTU 2374) found in artemia metanauplii displays
closest 16S rRNA gene relatedness with P. zeaxanthinifaciens
(Table S3), a bacterium isolated from seaweed found to produce
the yellow carotenoid zeaxanthin, a compound applied in
poultry pigmentation and in the prevention of age-related
degeneration in humans (Berry et al., 2003). Its low abundance
in rearing-water (both at 2 and 34 DAH) suggests that this strain
may accumulate into live feed tissue (especially Artemia spp.)
through filtering activity and then pass onto fish larvae through
feeding. However, it tends not to be present in such high densities
in the fish host as observed in the live feed, but rather to be a
regular, constituent member of a more diversified fish bacterial
consortium. In the specific context of our gilthead seabream
larval rearing, both Loktanella and Paracoccus are, apparently,

The Bacteriome of Fish Larvae

the case of widespread P. atlantica (Corpe, 1973; Holmström
and Kjelleberg, 1999). Several Pseudoalteromonas strains,
including representatives of P. undina and P. espejiana, were
found to present no virulence toward gilthead sea-bream
juveniles (Pujalte et al., 2007), and therefore we suggest that
the interaction of these species with sea-bream larvae is
rather of a commensalistic or mutualistic nature. The fish
larvae-associated community shifts markedly in structure at
34 DAH, whereby genera such as Pseudomonas, Actinobacillus,
Streptococcus, Massilia, and Paracoccus prevailed. It is likely
that the above-mentioned changes are, to a considerable extent,
driven by the higher degree of tissue compartmentalization,
and thus distinct niche availability, in fully developed fish
larvae. This could also partially explain the higher bacterial
diversity found in 34 DAH than in 2 DAH larvae. Further,
changes in the quality and quantity of available organic
carbon that take place during larval rearing (Vadstein et al.,
2013) certainly influence the dynamics and propagation of
microorganisms in the system, possibly playing a role in the
differential enrichment of bacterial phylotypes at early and late
larval developmental stages observed here. Bearing in mind
the limitations of 16S rRNA gene approaches in delivering
accurate species-level identification, and therefore serving as
proxies for pathogenicity among the bacteria (Martins et al.,
2013), we here offer a cautious interpretation of potential
symbiotic vs. pathogenic behavior derived from taxonomy
data. Future cultivation-independent, functional studies of
the fish larval microbiota, enabled e.g., via shotgun DNA
sequencing, will be fundamental to more adequately address
the relative proportions of mutualistic vs. pathogenic traits
of bacterial associates at early vs. late larval rearing stages,
advancing our current knowledge in this regard besides 16S
rRNA gene-centered bacterial taxonomic profiling. Nevertheless,
our methodological approach delivered a sound diagnosis of
the status of the larva-associated bacterial communities and
shifts thereof. Based on our results, we envision the fish host
intermittently subjected to a succession of bacterial cohorts
that shift in structure—composition, diversity, abundance—
during larval rearing, substantially contributing to a differential
recruitment of bacterial associates by fish larvae as the host
develops.
Finally, the structure of bacterial communities populating
fish hatcheries is likely to shift considerably in a case-by-case
manner. Certainly, manifold factors, such as intrinsic features
of the larviculture system itself, the quality and the indigenous
microbiota of the water supply, the reared species, the chosen diet
and environmental parameters, among others, are all supposed
to play a role in shaping the larviculture microbial consortia.
For instance, the assemblages of dominant bacterial genera
reported here for gilthead seabream differ from those reported
recently for cod larvae (Bakke et al., 2015), highlighting the
relevance of the host species, among other factors, in shaping
its symbiotic consortium. Therefore, continued research effort
is needed for a broader understanding of the dynamics of
these microbial communities across several model fish species
and rearing conditions, if we are to effectively manipulate
these assemblages for improved land-based fish larviculture.

detect Streptococcus and Actinobacillus-related sequences in live
feed and tank water, the actual source(s) of these phylotypes
to the fish larvae could not be verified. However, this is
likely to be overcome in future studies employing greater
sequencing output. For Streptococcus spp. particularly, their
presence in 2 DAH larvae suggests that they are early fish
colonizers with the ability to persist and eventually increase
in abundance as the host develops. This could either result
from high competitive capacity within the emerging fish (gut)
microbiome or cumulative host colonization from low abundant,
environmental populations, or through both mechanisms
simultaneously.
Our data strengthen previous observations concerning the
disparity between bacterial community profiles from fish larvae
and their corresponding live feed (Bakke et al., 2013, 2015).
However, we posit that the latter are actual participants in
shaping the fish (larvae) microbiome and might bear importance
as latent vectors of bacterial associates of fish. Here, we
reveal several bacterial phylotypes that occurred at negligible
abundances in the live feed, but were specifically selected for
in fish larvae. In fact, such a pattern of bacterial enrichment—
of either mutualists, pathogens or commensals—in, or on
the surface of, eukaryotes is common across several hostmicrobe interactions in aquatic ecosystems (Webster et al.,
2010; Simister et al., 2012; Costa et al., 2013; Hardoim
et al., 2014; Cúcio et al., 2016). It may be driven by diverse
mechanisms, such as host filtering/drinking activity, parental
symbiont transmission and host-derived chemical cues, besides
the high doubling rates of opportunistic bacteria during
favorable conditions. Altogether, all seven sample categories
represented microbial communities that significantly differ in
structure (Figure 4 and Figure S1), even if only presence/absence
OTU data are considered (Figure 4D and Figure S1D). The
extent of between-replicate variability in community distance
measures, within any given sample category, was much
reduced when OTU relative abundances were considered in
both datasets with and without singletons (Figure 4B and
Figure S1B), highlighting the importance of taxon abundance
ranks in determining consistency in community assembly
patterns.
We here describe the autochthonous bacterial consortium
of early-stage gilthead seabream larvae as a quite diverse
(Figure 2C), readily detectable community of prevalently
alpha—and gammaproteobacterial lineages (Figure 3B)
emerging prior to host’s mouth opening and complex
tissues’ development. Therefore, they likely represent, to
some extent, the assemblage of pioneering bacterial settlers on
eggs. This assemblage is primarily formed by typical free-living,
commensalistic or symbiotic marine bacteria (e.g., Marinomonas,
Acidocella, Pseudoalteromonas, Rhodobacteraceae). Of note here
is the high abundance of OTU 1296, which presented 100%
16S rRNA gene similarity with multiple species of the genus
Pseudoalteromonas (e.g., P. porphyrae, P.‘atlantica, P. undina,
P. espejiana, Table S3). Pseudoalteromonas spp. perform well
as early colonizers of marine surfaces, eventually dictating
bacterial succession in such substrates through the profuse
biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides and enzymes, as is

In this study, we diagnosed an intriguing pattern of hostdriven enrichment and de-selection of bacterial phlotypes in
both 2 and 34 DAH gilthead seabream larvae, highlighting the
relative contribution of the environment (rearing-water) and the
live feed as sources of bacteria, and of selective pressures, in
shaping the microbiome of early-stage fish larvae. Determining
the mutualistic or eventual pathogenic nature of these bacterial
associates will lead to a much improved understanding of the
relevance and dynamics of the fish larvae microbiome. In spite
of the comprehensive approach employed in this study, future
surveys approaching microbial diversity associated with other
important components (“microhabitats”) of the system, such as
the microalgae commonly used in the application of the “green
water technique” can further enhance our knowledge of the
phylogenetic breadth of the microbial consortia that are relevant
to fish larval rearing.

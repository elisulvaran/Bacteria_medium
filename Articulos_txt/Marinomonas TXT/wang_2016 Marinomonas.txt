Arylsulfatase agarose desulfation sulfated
galactan spectroscopy

a b s t r a c t
Agar and sulfated galactans were isolated from the red seaweeds Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis and Gelidium
amansii. A previously puriﬁed arylsulfatase from Marinomonas sp. FW-1 was used to remove sulfate
groups in agar and sulfated galactans. After enzymatic desulfation, the sulfate content decreased to about
0.16% and gel strength increased about two folds. Moreover, there was no difference between the DNA
electrophoresis spectrum on the gel of the arylsulfatase-treated agar and that of the commercial agarose.
In order to reveal the desulfation ratio and site, chemical and structural identiﬁcation of sulfated galactan
were carried out. G. amansii sulfated galactan with 7.4% sulfated content was composed of galactose and
3,6-anhydro-l-galactose. Meanwhile, G. lemaneiformis sulfated galactan with 8.5% sulfated content was
composed of galactose, 3,6-anhydro-l-galactose, 2-O-methyl-3,6-anhydro-l-galactose and xylose. Data
from 13 C NMR, FT-IR, GC–MS provided evidence of sulfate groups at C-4 and C-6 of d-galactose and C-6
of l-galactose both in GRAP and GEAP. Data from GC–MS revealed that desulfation was carried out by the
arylsulfatase at the sulfate bonds at C-4 and C-6 of d-galactose and C-6 of l-galactose, with a desulfation
ratio of 83.4% and 86.0% against GEAP and GRAP, respectively.

1. Introduction
Algae belonging to the red seaweed genera of Gracilariopsis and
Gelidium are important resources in the agar industry [1]. Agar is
generally considered to be a mixture of about 70% agarose and 30%
sulfated galactan [2]. Agarose can be used as an electrophoresis
medium and a chromatographic resin, which are widely used in
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Moreover, the gel
properties of agar enable its broad application as a gelling agent
in processed foods and cosmetics products [3]. In the agar industry, alkaline treatment is the traditional method of removing the
primary sulfate groups of the galactopyranose unit by converting
it to 3,6-anhydrogalactopyranose [4]. The alkaline treatment could
improve the gel strength; however it has many drawbacks, such
as decreasing polysaccharide yield, browning of agar product, and
generation of environmental pollution [5]. Thus, there is a growing
need to develop eco-friendly processing technologies for recovery
of products from bioresource. Enzymatic processing technology can
solve these problems.

Arylsulfatase (aryl-sulfate sulfohydrolase; E.C.3.1.6.1) can catalyze the hydrolysis of arylsulfate esters to aryl compounds and
inorganic sulfate. The puriﬁcation and characterization of a few
arylsulfatases have been reported [6]. However, only arylsulfatase
from Sphingomonas sp. AS 6330 [7] and arylsulfatase puriﬁed in
our previous study [8] have been reported to improve agar quality.
Our previous study reported that after enzymatic treatment, the
sulfate content of agar decreased, and the content of 3,6-anhydrogalactose increased. However, the desulfation mechanism remains
unknown.
Similar to agarose, sulfated galactans usually have a linear
backbone built on alternating 3-linked ␤-galactopyranose (G) and
4-linked ␣-galactopyranose residues [9]. In general, sulfate groups
are found in some C-6 of the 4-linked ␣-l-galactose unit, the biogenic precursor of the 3,6-anhydro-␣-l-galactopyranose (LA) unit
[10]. The incorporation of sulfate groups into agar usually weakens
gel strength because of the avoidance of a cross-linked structure
during gelation [11].
This study aimed to evaluate the potential application of arylsulfatase from Marinomonas sp. FW-1 to improve agar quality and
to reveal its desulfation mechanism. To obtain a relatively puriﬁed substrate for this enzyme, sulfated galactans with relatively
high sulfate content were isolated from red seaweeds Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis and Gelidium amansii. Structural characterizations

of sulfated galactan before and after enzymatic treatment were
performed by chemical and spectroscopy methods.

Data were expressed as the mean ± standard (SD). Statistical
analyses were performed by one-way Turkey (SPSS V 21.0). Group
means were considered to be signiﬁcantly different at P < 0.05.

2. Experimental
2.1. Collection of seaweed

2.5. The desulfation mechanism of sulfated galactan by
arylsulfatase

G. lemaneiformis was harvested from Fujian Province, China
(24.8◦ N and 118.6◦ E) in April 2014. G. amansii was harvested from
Shandong Province, China (35.7◦ N and 120◦ E) in July 2014. After
collection, the samples were cleaned, air dried, ground in a mill to
ﬁne powder, and stored at −20 ◦ C.

The enzymatic desulfation mechanism was revealed by comparing changes in sulfated galactan structure before and after
enzymatic treatment. Hence, the structures of sulfated galactans
from G. lemaneiformis and G. amansii were analyzed before mechanism investigation.

2.2. Isolation of agar and sulfated galactan
The dried tissue (20 g) was autoclaved for 2 h at 121 ◦ C in 600 mL
of distilled water. The water soluble fraction was separated from
the residue by ﬁltration and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min.
Agar solution was cooled down to room temperature, gelated,
frozen overnight, and thawed. After removing the thawed liquid,
the agar gel was dried with hot air.
The isolated agar (10 g) was dissolved in 400 mL of 8.87 mM
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt solution and stirred
for 4 h at 60 ◦ C. After ﬁltration and concentration of the solution,
the sulfated galactan was precipitated with ethanol (1:3, v/v), redissolved in distilled water, dialyzed, and lyophilized. Sulfated
galactans from G. lemaneiformis and G. amansii were isolated as
described above and designated as GRAP and GEAP, respectively.
2.3. Enzymatic desulfation of agar
The arylsulfatase was used to degrade the sulfate groups of agar
from G. amansii and G. lemaneiformis. Agar powder (5 g) was suspended in 50 mL of 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) and liqueﬁed at
121 ◦ C for 30 min. After cooling down to 45 ◦ C, 200 U of puriﬁed
arylsulfatase was added to the agar, which was incubated overnight
at 45 ◦ C. After incubation, the enzymatic treated agar was extracted
and dried through a traditional freezing melting and drying method
[12].
2.4. Physical properties of commercial agarose products and agar
The physical properties like gel strength, melting and gelling
temperatures, sulfate content and gel electrophoresis were evaluated in commercial agarose and agar from G. lemaneiformis and G.
amansii before and after enzymatic treatment.
The sulfate content was determined by the turbidimetric
method [13]. Gel strength was measured on agar discs (5 cm
diameter, 6 cm height) using a texture analyzer (TMS-PRO, Food
Technology, USA) with a 0.78 cm2 probe area and operated at a
crosshead speed of 0.5 mm s−1 . Finally, 1% agar solution was gelated
at 25 ◦ C for 15 h before measurement. The gelling and melting
temperatures were recorded with a precision thermometer (0.1 ◦ C
divisions), in 1.0% agar solution as previously described [14].
Gel electrophoresis was performed using the enzymatically
desulfated agar and the commercial agarose was used as a control.
The experiment was performed with 1.0% of gel and 100–200 bp
DNA ladder using a mini-sub cell GT 8 gel rigs (Bio-Rad) according
to the method of Sambrook [15].
IR spectra were recorded from the polysaccharide powder in
KBr pellets using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet Nexus 470, Thermo Electron, USA) between 400 and 4000 cm−1 .
The FT-IR spectrum was used to compare the structure of agar
before and after the enzymatic treatment by puriﬁed arylsulfatase
and the commercial agarose was used as a control.

2.5.1. Structure of sulfated galactan
2.5.1.1. General analysis. The monosaccharide compositions of
GEAP and GRAP were determined by GC and GC–MS as their alditol
acetates. Derivatives were prepared by two-step reductive hydrolysis with N-methylmorpholine-borane followed by acetylation as
previously described [16]. GC analysis was performed using Agilent
6890N GC instrument equipped with a fused silica capillary column DB-225 (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 ␮m; J & M Scientiﬁc, Folsom,
CA, USA). Samples were detected with a ﬂame ionization detector
at 250 ◦ C, whereas the injector and oven temperatures were set at
250 and 210 ◦ C, respectively.
GC–MS of partially methylated alditol acetates was carried out
on a spectrometer equipped with DB-225 using helium as carrier
gas. The temperature program was the same as in GC analysis.
Sulfate content was measured by the turbidimetric method
reported by Dodgson and Price [13] with some modiﬁcations after
hydrolysis of the samples with 1 M HCl for 4 h at 105 ◦ C. In a
typical procedure, 4 mL of barium chloride-gelatin reagent was
incubated with 1 mL of K2 SO4 solution at room temperature for
15 min, with substrate concentrations of 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, 0.18, 0.24,
and 0.30 mg/mL SO4 2− ion and then measured at 360 nm. Gelatin
solution was performed as described above.
The peak molar masses were estimated by gel-permeation chromatography using an Agilent 1260 instrument equipped with a
differential refractometer detector in a TSK-gel GM PWXL column (7.8 mm × 30 cm) at 35 ◦ C and a ﬂow rate of 0.5 mL/min.
Polysaccharide concentration was 1 mg/mL in 0.2 M NaCl solvent.
Dextran samples of Mw 5.21 × 105 , 2.89 × 105 , 1.1 × 104 , 6.06 × 104 ,
1.26 × 104 , and 4.32 × 103 g mol−1 were used as standards.
2.5.1.2. Spectroscopy methods. IR spectra were recorded from the
polysaccharide powder in KBr pellets using a Fourier transform
infrared spectrometer between 400 and 4000 cm−1 .
Samples (20 mg) were dissolved in 0.5 mL of D2 O and freeze
dried twice to replace all exchangeable protons with deuterium. 13 C
and 1 H NMR spectra of the polysaccharide were recorded at 35 ◦ C on
a ProPulse NMR 500 MHz. A distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT 135◦ ) spectrum was recorded to determine
the hydrogenation of each carbon. 2D 1 H and 13 C HSQC spectra were
carried out using the pulse programs supplied with the apparatus.
Acetone-d6 was used as the internal standard.
2.5.1.3. Desulfation and methylation analysis. According to the
method of Nagasawa [17], desulfation reaction was carried out in
2 mL of DMSO-methanol (9:1, v/v) at 80 ◦ C for 10 h. The desulfated
product was recovered by dialysis and then freeze dried.
Methylation analyses of native and desulfated polysaccharide
were carried out by the method of Hakomori [18] after converting
to pyridinium salts by using ion-exchange resin [19]. The methylated polysaccharide was hydrolyzed, reduced, and acetylated as
described above before being subjected to GC–MS analysis.

2.5.2. Structure of enzymatic treated sulfated galactans
Enzymatic desulfation was carried out by incubating sulfated
galactan and arylsulfatase in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) buffer at
45 ◦ C for 12 h. The polysaccharide was precipitated with ethanol
(1:3, v/v) and freeze dried. Thereafter, the structure of obtained
polysaccharides was analyzed by methylation and acetylation. FTIR and GC–MS analyses of the desulfated polysaccharide were
carried out according to the method described in 2.5.1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Application of arylsulfatase in improving agar quality
After enzymatic treatment, the sulfate content of G. amansii
agar remarkably decreased from 1.11% to 0.16%, whereas that of
G. lemaneiformis agar remarkably decreased from 1.52% to 0.17%.
The sulfate contents of several commercial agarose products purchased from Sigma and Biowest were determined to range within
0.11% to 0.17%. As shown in Table 1, the physical properties like gel
strength and sulfate content of the enzymatic treated agar showed
signiﬁcant differences as comparing with those of untreated agar.
The gel strength of desulfated agar of G. amansii (1080 g cm−2 ) and
G. lemaneiformis (1035 g cm−2 ) was similar to that of commercial
agarose (1129 g cm−2 ) for electrophoresis. Gel strength increased
about two folds compared with that of untreated agar. The gelling
and melting temperatures of desulfated G. amansii agar were 36.5
and 93.2 ◦ C, respectively, and those of G. lemaneiformis agar were
34.0 and 94.8 ◦ C, respectively.
The peak of 1250 cm−1 in FT-IR spectra was attributed to sulfate
groups. The FT-IR spectra (Figs. 1 and 2) indicated that the peak
signal in 1250 cm−1 signiﬁcantly decreased after enzymatic treatment using the puriﬁed arylsulfatase and the spectra (Figs. 1b, 2b
and 3 ) were similar between enzymatic treated agar products and
commercial agarose. The results demonstrated that sulfate groups
of G. lemaneiformis and G. amansii agar could be removed by aryl-

sulfatase and enzymatic treated agar products reached the level of
commercial agarose.
Commercial agarose product and G. amansii and G. lemaneiformis
agar before and after enzymatic treatment were applied to agarose
gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). DNA fragments on both gels of enzymatic desulfated agar and commercial agarose showed excellent
separation resolution. Hence, the above result indicated that the
quality of enzymatic-treated agar was signiﬁcantly improved by
arylsulfatase to values similar to those of commercial agarose.
3.2. General analysis of sulfated galactan
The reductive hydrolysis of GEAP and GC–MS analysis indicated
the presence of galactose (58.2%), 3,6-AG (29.8%), 2-O-methyl-3,6-

AG (8.5%), and xylose (3.5%). The monosaccharide composition of
GRAP was galactose (66.1%) and 3,6-AG (33.9%). The chemical analysis and monosaccharide composition of sulfated polysaccharide
are shown in Table 2.
Peaks at 14.502 and 19.227 min of GEAP and at 16.100 and
16.269 min of GRAP were observed in the gel-permeation chromatogram. Both sulfated galactans behaved as a heterogeneous
system similar to polysaccharides from Gracilaria birdiae [20],
Gracilaria Cornea [21] and Botryocladia occidentalis [22]. The molar
masses of the two peaks of GEAP were estimated to be 7 × 104
and 1780 g mol−1 , respectively, and those of GRAP were 5 × 105
and 1870 g mol−1 , respectively. Polysaccharides were polydisperse,
meaning that they generally did not have sharply deﬁned molecular weights, but rather average molecular weights representing a
distribution of molecular species nearly identical in structure but
varying in chain length [23].
Despite similar sulfate contents and molecular masses, the
monosaccharide composition of GEAP was more complex than
GRAP. As shown in Table 2, the monosaccharide composition and
quantities of major monosaccharide of galactose and 3,6-AG were
generally variable depending on species [20,24].

3.3. Structure analysis of sulfated galactose
3.3.1. FT-IR analysis
The FT-IR spectra of GRAP and GEAP are shown in Figs. 5 and 5,
respectively. Data revealed the characteristic bands of agar-type
polysaccharides (1250, 1072, 931, and 893 cm−1 ) [20,25]. The
absorbance band at 1250 cm−1 was attributed to the asymmetric
stretching of the sulfate ester group [21,26]. The regions around
1070 and 890 cm−1 were equivalent to the skeleton of galactan
and agar speciﬁc band, respectively [27]. The band at 930 cm−1
was assigned to the vibration of the C O C bridge in 3,6-AG [28].
The position of the sulfate group of agar-type polysaccharide was
identiﬁed by the bands at 800–850 cm−1 [29]. Several references
revealed that the bands at 850 and 830 cm−1 were attributed to
the 4-O-sulfate and 2-O-sulfate groups, respectively, in d-galactose
units, whereas the signals at 820 and 805 cm−1 were due to sulfate
groups located at C-6 of d-galactose and at C-2 of 3,6-AG, respectively [21,25,27].
The presence of an imperceptible shoulder close to 850 cm−1
indicated a small degree of substitution at C-4 of d-galactose sugar
units. Several sulfated galactans from Gracilariopsis and Gelidium

were found to possess these sulfation patterns [20,24,25,28]. GEAP
and GRAP did not show signals resolved at 805 cm−1 , indicating the
absence of a sulfate group at C-2 of 3,6-AG.
3.3.2. NMR spectroscopy
NMR spectroscopy is a convenient method of obtaining valuable
composition information on red seaweed polysaccharides [30]. In
the present work, 1D and 2D NMR analyses were used to investi-

gate polysaccharide structure. The NMR spectra of GRAP and GEAP
are shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. The 1 H NMR spectra of
GRAP and GEAP are depicted in Figs. 7a and 8a, respectively. The
signals from ␣ anomeric proton at ␦ 5.13 and 5.27 were assigned to
LA and ␣-l-galactose-6-sulfate (L6S), respectively [31]. H-1 of ␤-dgalactose (G ) was linked to L6S, and that of G was linked to LA at ␦
4.43 and 4.54, respectively [24]. Fig. 7a shows an intense resonance
signal at ␦ 1.44, attributed to methyl protons of the cyclic pyruvate acetal as 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene) group, together with
a signal at ␦ 5.20, which was described as H-1 of the l-galactose
residue linking to a pyruvated d-galactose residue [28,32]. This
spectrum also revealed a methylation pattern with signal resolution at ␦ 3.50 for protons of methyl groups attached onto O-2 of
3,6-␣-l-anhydrogalactose.
The observed resonances were consistent with an alternating
structure of the agaran type in the 13 C NMR spectrum (Figs. 7b and
8b) of both sulfated galactans, whereas the absence of any anomeric
signal below 98 ppm indicated the lack of 4-linked d-galactose
residues [33]. Four main signals were found in the anomeric region
of 13 C NMR (␦ 90–110) of GRAP (Fig. 7b), which were assigned based
on the data reported by Kolender and Matulewicz [33]. The signal from C-1 at ␦ 98.2 was assigned to LA, whereas the signal at
␦ 101 was attributed to L6S. The signals at ␦ 102.08 and 103.13
were assigned to C-1 of G and G , respectively. The above signals
were also observed in GEAP (Fig. 8b). In addition, the signal at ␦
98.42 was attributed to C-1 of the l-galactose residue linked to a
pyruvated d-galactose residue.
DEPT 135◦ experiments were performed to investigate the presence of oxymethylene groups, considering that the pulse sequence
signals of carbons bearing two protons had opposite amplitude to
the CH and CH3 carbons [25]. The DEPT 135◦ spectrum of GRAP
(Fig. 7c) showed ﬁve CH2 signals at ␦ 69.2, 67.66, 67.42, 61.52,
and 61.2, which were attributed to LA, L6S, 6-O-sulfate-d-galactose
(G6S), G , and G, respectively. In the spectrum of DEPT 135◦ of GEAP
(Fig. 8c), two new peaks were observed apart from the above signals. A signal at ␦ 65.4 was assigned to a pyruvated d-galactose
residue and a small signal at (␦ 59) of O CH3 , indicating that a low
amount of O-methyl sugar residues were present in GEAP.
To assign the spin system for GRAP and GEAP, the 2D NMR
technique was used. The HSQC spectra showed the correlation of
anomeric carbons with their respective protons, i.e., ı 98.2/5.13 for
LA residue, ı 102/4.54 for G residue, ı 101/5.27 for L6S residue, and
ı 103.3/4.4 for G residue. A correlation for carbon at ı 59/3.4 was
observed in the HSQC spectrum of GEAP (Fig. 8d), which indicated
the presence of methoxyl group in the galactose residue. Similarly, ı
25.4/1.44 indicated the presence of pyruvated d-galactose residues.
2D COSY (Figs. 7e and 8e) was used to determine the proton
resonance sequence. The anomeric resonance at 4.54 ppm in the
ﬁrst spin system gave easily identiﬁable correlations from H-1 to
H-2–H-6 of G in the 1 H–1 H COSY spectrum which demonstrated the
presence of several spin systems. For example, the coupling constants between H-1 (ı 4.54 ppm) and H-2 (ı 3.61 ppm), H-2 and H-3
(ı 3.77 ppm) of G were observed. The anomeric proton at 5.13 ppm

spectrum showed a correlation on the HSQC spectrum with the C2 atom (C-2 of LA ı 69.57, C-2 of L6S ı 69.76, and C-2 of G ı 70.0).
Moreover, for L6S, H-1/H-2 was at ı 5.274/3.85 and H-3/H-4 at ı
3.94/4.38. Based on 1D and 2D NMR spectra and literature data, the

signal assignments of sulfated galactans from G. lemaneiformis and
G. amansii are listed in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.
3.3.3. Methylation analysis
To conﬁrm glycoside linkage position and identify sulfate-group
location on GEAP and GRAP, methylation was performed before and
after desulfation by DMSO-MeOH. Results of methylation analysis

signiﬁcantly increased before and after desulfation. Conversely,
the amount of some derivatives related to sulfate groups such

as 1,4,5,6-Ac4 -2,3-Me2 -G, 1,3,4,5-Ac4 -2,6-Me2 -G, and 1,3,5,6Ac4 -2,4-Me2 -G decreased. Hence, sulfate groups of both sulfated
galactans were situated at C-4 and C-6 positions of 3-linked
d-galactose (G4S and G6S) and C-6 of 4-linked l-galactose (L6S).
IR, NMR, and GC–MS results further revealed the structure of
sulfated galactans from G. lemaneiformis and G. amansii (Figs. 9a
and b).

3.4. Structure analysis of desulfated galactan and desulfation
mechanism by arylsulfatase
After enzymatic treatment, sulfate content was measured by the
turbidimetric method. Results indicated that the sulfate content of
GEAP remarkably decreased from 7.4% to 1.26% with a desulfation
ratio of 82.97%, and that of GRAP remarkably decreased from 8.48%
to 1.19% with a desulfation ratio of 86.32%.

As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the FT-IR peak of 1250 cm−1 attributed
to the asymmetric stretching of sulfate ester group signiﬁcantly
decreased after enzymatic treatment by arylsulfatase. The absence
of band at 850 cm−1 indicated that sulfate groups of galactose were
eliminated. The above results demonstrated that Marinomonas
arylsulfatase was an efﬁcient catalyst for removing sulfate groups
in sulfated galactans from G. lemaneiformis and G. amansii. Methylation was performed before and after desulfation by arylsulfatase,

608

and the products were analyzed by GC–MS. Results of methylation
analysis of polysaccharides before and after enzymatic desulfation
are given in Table 5.
Signiﬁcant changes in 1,4,5-AC3 -2-Me-3,6-AG, 1,3,5-Ac3 -2,4,6Me3 -G, and 1,4,5,6-Ac4 -2,3-Me2 -G contents before and after
desulfation were observed in the GC–MS results of both GEAP
and GRAP. Methylation analysis of desulfation GRAP showed
an increase in 1,3,5-Ac3 -2,4,6-Me3 -G together with a concomitant decrease in 1,3,4,5-Ac4 -2,6-Me2 -G and 1,3,5,6-Ac3 -2,4-Me2 -G,
which suggested that the sulfate groups of G4S and G6S were
removed by arylsulfatase. Furthermore, given the increase in
1,4,5,6-Ac4 -2,3-Me2 -G content in the premethylated product after
desulfation, sulfate groups elimination of L6S were present.
Considering the increase in 1,4,5-Ac3 -2,3,6-Me3 -G content
after enzymatic treatment, not all L6S (3,6-AG precursor) were
converted to 3,6-AG during enzymatic treatment. Results of methylation analysis for GRAP were similar to those for GEAP, so
the desulfation mechanism of arylsulfatase against agar of G.
lemaneiformis was similar to that of G. amansii.
Alkaline treatment is a traditional method widely used in the
agar-related industry to remove primary sulfate groups, especially
at C-6 position of the galactopyranose unit and to consequently
produce 3,6-anhydrogalactose derivatives [10]. Apart from chemical method, enzymatic desulfation can reportedly improve agar
quality. Shukla et al. [34] reported that after the treatment of G.
dura agar by sulfohydrolase, sulfate content decreased, whereas
the amount of 3,6-anhydrogalactose was increased. Furthermore,
enzymatic desulfation improved gel strength because its value
increased from 190 g cm−2 to 470 g cm−2 . SEM images signiﬁed that
the enzymatic-desulfated agar was a morphologically distinct agar
product with a much stronger network of ordered helical structure than the control agar. After sulfohydrolase reaction, the helical
structure of agar cross-linked with one another to form a thick
helix. Kim et al. [7] reported that after the treatment of agar by
arylsulfatase from Sphingomonas, sulfate content decreases from
3.9% to 0.09%, whereas gel strength increases from 462 g cm−2 to
1128 g cm−2 . These two studies indicated that enzymatic desulfation could improve agar quality. However the changes of structure
of agar before and after enzymatic treatment were not studied. In
the present work, GC–MS and FT-IR results showed that sulfate
groups located at C-6 of ␣-l-galactose could be removed by arylsulfatase, and parts of formed l-galactose were converted to 3,6-AG.
The above conversion procedure was similar to that of alkaline
treatment. Superior to alkaline treatment, this arylsulfatase also
showed excellent activity for removing sulfate groups located at
C-4 and C-6 of d-galactose. Sulfate groups at C-6 or C-4 were stable in alkali [35]. After sulfate-group removal, the helical structure
became more regular and intermolecular electrostatic repulsion
decreased, thus a much stronger network was formed and the gel
strength of agar was greatly improved.
4. Conclusion
Superior to alkaline treatment, arylsulfatase from Marinomonas
sp. FW-1 showed excellent activity for removing sulfate groups
located at C-6 of ␣-l-galactose and at C-4 and C-6 of ␤-d-galactose
insulfated galactans of the red seaweeds G. lemaneiformis and G.
amansii. The enzymatic treated agar showed characteristics similar with those of commercialized agarose. Our ﬁndings revealed

the enzymatic desulfation mechanism of sulfated galactan by arylsulfatase and provided an enzymatic processing methodology for
agarose production.

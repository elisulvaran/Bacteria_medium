In the search for novel antibiotics, natural products continue to represent a valid source of bioactive molecules. During
a program aimed at identifying previously unreported taxa of actinomycetes as potential source of novel compounds, we
isolated hundreds of different representatives of a new group, initially designated as ‘Alpha’ and independently described as
Actinoallomurus. We report on a PCR-specific method for the detection of this taxon, on appropriate growth conditions and on a
pilot-screening program on 78 strains. The strains produce antibacterial or antifungal compounds at a relatively high frequency.
Four strains were characterized in further detail: one produced the aromatic polyketide benanomicin B and its dexylosyl
derivative; a second strain produced N-butylbenzenesulfonamide; a third strain was an efficient converter of soymeal
isoflavonoids from soymeal constituents; and a fourth strain produced several coumermycin-related aminocoumarins, with
coumermycin A2 as the major peak, and with some new congeners as minor components of the complex. These data suggest
that Actinoallomurus strains possess several pathways for secondary metabolism and represent an attractive source in the search
for novel antibiotics.

INTRODUCTION
New antibiotics are urgently needed because of the increasing spread
of resistant pathogens and the evolution of new diseases. As microbial
genomes, synthetic libraries and high throughput screening have so
far failed to produce a significant number of developmental candidates
in the antibacterial field, it is generally acknowledged that nature will
continue to be a significant source of novel bioactive compounds,1
as confirmed by a recent survey of antibiotics under clinical development.2 However, in a background of several thousands of known
microbial metabolites, it is necessary to introduce new strategies for
accessing microbial strains to increase the probability of finding novel
compounds. Chemical screening3 and, more recently, genome mining4
are alternatives to the traditional bioassay-guided screening. In the
latter case, the probability of finding new compounds may be
increased by the use of novel assays, of novel microorganisms or by
the mere size of the library to be screened.5 In any case, dedicated
efforts are providing novel metabolites.6
In the past years, our attention has been drawn to previously
uncultured actinomycetes, under the assumption that strains belonging to novel taxa, which are however phylogenetically related to
prolific producers of secondary metabolites, have a high chance of
possessing diverse pathways in secondary metabolism and of affording
novel compounds.7 A 16S-guided isolation program led to the

identification of several new taxa,7 three of which have been subsequently formally described.8–10 During that program we were also able
to isolate hundreds of different strains provisionally designated as
‘Alpha’, whose phylogenetic position suggested a new taxon within the
Actinobacteria.7 Independently, phylogenetically related strains have
been assigned to the recently described genus Actinoallomurus.11
We present here a characterization of ‘Alpha’ strains present in our
collections, in terms of their potential to produce secondary metabolites. The results from a small pilot study suggest that the genus
Actinoallomurus has the potential to produce metabolites arising from
different biosynthetic pathways.
RESULTS
In the course of isolation programs, aimed at identifying actinomycetes belonging to new taxa,7 we isolated from soil samples several
actinomycete strains, with branching aerial hyphae that, as observed
by light microscopy on agar plates, differentiated into single spore
chains along the aerial mycelium, reminiscent of some Actinomadura
strains. Most of the strains were able to grow in the 30–37 1C
temperature range at an optimal pH of 5.5. Phylogenetic analysis of
selected strains indicated they belong to the recently described genus
Actinoallomurus within the Thermomonosporaceae.11 Furthermore, on
16S rRNA analysis, we were able to subdivide 115 strains in 32 ‘Alp’

phylotypes (Figure 1), indicating a substantial diversity within
this genus.
For the rapid identification of novel isolates, we developed an
Actinoallomurus-specific PCR method (see Methods). When we
applied this method to soil samples, about 25% of soil DNA preparations yielded a band of the expected size,7 suggesting that Actinoallomurus strains may be quite cosmopolitan. Consistently, strains
with an alpha-type morphology were isolated from many different
soils, and the PCR method proved an effective tool for rapidly
assigning most of them to Actinoallomurus.
The Thermomonosporaceae family currently comprises five genera
but, to our knowledge, only strains belonging to the genus Actinomadura have been reported to produce secondary metabolites. To
evaluate the ability of Actinoallomurus strains to produce bioactive
compounds, we identified suitable growth conditions (see Methods).
Examples of HPLC profiles are reported in Figure 2: different strains
yielded different profiles, suggesting production of different secondary
metabolites. Next, a pilot-screening program was carried out on

78 different strains belonging to 26 different phylotypes. About 30%
of the tested strains showed at least an antimicrobial activity in our
conditions (Table 1). These results prompted us to further investigate
these strains and identify the bioactive metabolites produced. Here, we
report the metabolites identified from four strains belonging to
different phylotypes. The data are summarized in Table 2.
Strain K15
Strain K15 produced an antifungal activity and a diffusible red
pigment. In all tested media, it showed good growth, and production
of the red pigment and of the antifungal activity, both of which could
be efficiently recovered from the mycelium by MeOH extraction.
HPLC fractionation of the MeOH extract, followed by LC-MS of the
active fractions, led to the identification of two peaks eluting at 14.5
and 16.0 mins, containing the major antifungal activity (Figure 3).
These peaks exhibited UV-VIS maxima at 500 nm and showed [MH+]
of 827 and 696 m/z, respectively. Searches in the ABL database
identified the antifungal compounds benanomicin B and its dexylosyl

derivative, respectively,12 as likely candidates for the metabolites
produced by strain K15. This was confirmed on a larger preparation
of the 14.5-min fraction from the NMR signals at 6.9–7.27 and 3.2–
4.75 p.p.m., expected from aromatic and sugar protons, respectively,
and by observing MS/MS fragmentations of m/z values of 695, 550
and 461, expected from the loss of the first and the second sugar and
the alanine residue, respectively (data not shown).
Strain K216
Strain K216, selected for its anti-Streptomyces aureus activity, produced
on agar plates, a cell-associated violet pigment turning dark green with
age. This activity could be recovered from both the mycelium and the
cleared broth. Ethyl acetate extraction of the cleared fermentation
broth, HPLC fractionation and LC-MS analyses led to the identification of one peak eluting at 15.7 min containing the major antibiotic
activity (Figure 4). One of the molecules present in this fraction
showed a [M+H]+ of 214 m/z. Search in the ABL database suggested
N-butylbenzenesulphonamide13 as the likely compound. NMR analysis confirmed this structure by comparison with the literature data.
Strain K241
K241 sporulates well on agar plates, in which it produces an agardiffusible black pigment. The strain produced an antistaphylococcal
activity, which was observed in the mycelium from INA5-15 cultures,
despite a relatively poor growth in this medium. LC-MS analysis
identified [M+H]+ peaks with m/z values of 271, 285 and 255, which
matched the isoflavonoids genistein, 7-O-methyl-genistein and daidzein, respectively. These compounds, which show antibacterial activity
as well as different pharmacological effects in animal cells,14 have been
reported before from actinomycetes,15 although it has been suggested
that these metabolites derive from microbial hydrolysis of glycosidic
plant isoflavonoids present in the culture medium rather than from

de novo biosynthesis.16 Consistently, HPLC analyses of organic extracts
from strain K241 grown in INA5 medium containing 5 g l 1 instead
of 15 g l 1 of soybean flour showed a corresponding decrease in the
height of the genistein, 7-O-methylgenistein and daidzein peaks,
which were absent altogether when soybean flour was omitted from
INA5 or in a soybean flour-free medium such as RARE3 medium
(Figure 5). These data suggest that strain K241 produces one or more
enzymes able to deglycosylate plant isoflavonoids. Interestingly, irrespective of the presence of isoflavonoids, methanolic extracts still
retained an activity against S. aureus, which still awaits identification.
Strain K275
Colonies of strain K275 progressed from ocher to violet on agar plates.
From a mycelium methanolic extract, the HPLC fractions, containing
antistaphylococcal activity, matched in their UV and MS properties
(Figure 6) with many congeners of the coumermycin complex.17 NMR
analysis of the most active fraction confirmed the presence of
coumermycin A2 (m/z 1082 [M+H]+), whereas we inferred the
presence of coumermycins D1, C and D (m/z values of 1096, 989
and 908 [M+H]+, respectively) by MS and MS/MS fragmentation.
As minor components of the complex, we also identified potentially
new coumermycin congeners showing m/z values of 1068 and 975
[M+H]+, with fragmentation patterns similar to coumermycin A2 and
C, respectively. The small amounts of these congeners, amid large
amounts of coumermycin A2, D1, C and D, prevented us from
carrying out their structural characterization.
DISCUSSION
Strains belonging to the genus Actinoallomurus seem to be present in
different environments, as indicated by our isolation efforts and by
screening soil DNA with our PCR method, as well as by their retrieval
from different sources, including soils, plants and dung, by other
groups.11,18–20 Furthermore, our limited phylogenetic analysis indicates a discrete level of genotypic diversity. Thus, this genus appears to
fulfill one requisite for being a valid source of bioactive compounds:
the possibility to access a significant number of strains with a
reasonable degree of diversity. Here, we have also started to address
the bioactive metabolites produced by Actinoallomurus strains.
Despite the use of a limited number of culturing conditions, our
results indicate that about 30% of the screened strains produce an
antimicrobial activity against three test strains, a fraction that favorably compares with other, well-established genera of filamentous
actinomycetes. From three different Actinoallomurus strains, we identified three unrelated compounds belonging to different chemical
classes: benanomicin, coumermycin and N-butylbenzensulphonamide. Benanomicin- and coumermycin-related compounds have
been reported as the products of Actinomadura or Streptomyces strains.
N-butylbenzensulphonamide, an antifungal compound active against
fungal plant pathogens, has been reported from a greenhouseassociated Pseudomonas strain13 and, very recently, from a terrestrial

appears to be an effective producer of isoflavonoids by biotransformation of soymeal constituents.
To our knowledge, the biosynthesis of N-butylbenzensulphonamide
has not been investigated. For the other compounds identified in this
study, the benanomicin family of compounds requires the participation of a type II polyketide synthase, followed by glycosylations and
other post-polyketide modifications.22 Formation of coumermycin

deoxysugar.23 Furthermore, we previously reported the presence of
type I polyketide synthase and nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes
in Actinoallomurus strains,7 a property commonly found in many
Actinobacteria genera,24 including recently described lineages.25 Thus,
at least some of the major pathways leading to bioactive compounds
in filamentous actinomycetes are present in Actinoallomurus. These
results would need to be complemented by analysis of selected
genomes.
Although only four strains have been analyzed in this work, with
just some new congeners from the coumermycin family identified, we

believe that Actinoallomurus represents a promising source of novel
bioactive metabolites. In this respect, the availability of B1200 isolates
in our strain collections represents an untapped resource worth exploring.
METHODS
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
The ‘Alpha’ strains used in this work were derived from the KtedoGen strain
collection. In some cases, their affiliation with the genus Actinoallomurus was

confirmed by phylotyping. They were maintained on S15.5 plates (oatmeal
60 g l 1, agar 15 g l 1, adjusted to pH 5.5 with HCl). For liquid cultures, a
loopful of mycelium was scraped from an agar plate, inoculated into 15 ml of
AF5.5 (see ref. 5) in a 100-ml baffled flask. For a larger scale, a 10% inoculum
from a 6-day AF5.5 culture was inoculated into 100–1000 ml of medium.
Additional media used were M8 (see ref. 5), INA5-15 (see ref. 5), V6 (see
ref. 26) and RARE3 (see ref. 27). INA5-5 and INA5-0 consist of INA5-15
containing 5 and 0 g l 1 soybean flour, respectively. For all media, the pH was

adjusted to 5.5 with HCl before sterilization. All liquid cultures were incubated
for 7–10 days at 37 1C on a rotary shaker at 200 r.p.m.

PCR-selective method
Genomic DNA was extracted with the GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA kit
(Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany) or by colony picking as described.28
PCR amplification, sequence and phylogenetic analyses were performed as
described.29 Strains were assigned to the same phylotype if they shared 499.5%
identity over 1400 bp of the 16S rRNA gene.
PCR primers for the specific amplification of the Actinoallomurus 16S rRNA
gene were designed following a previously described procedure.29 Briefly,
aligned sequences obtained from Actinoallomurus strains were compared with
the consensus sequences obtained for other genera and families of the
Actinomycetales, and conserved regions within the Actinoallomurus sequences
were probed against the RDP database (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/) to discard
aspecific primers. The specificity of selected primer pairs was then evaluated on
genomic DNAs extracted from different actinomycete genera. This procedure led to selection of primers 5¢-CGTGAGTAACCTGCCCYYRG-3¢ and
5-CKTWMGCTTCGTCGGTGG-3¢. Reactions were performed in a final
volume of 50 ml, containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3 (20 1C),
500 nM of each primer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 U of RedTaq
DNA polymerase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 3 ml of 10 Denhardt’s reagent
(2 g Ficoll 400, 2 g polyvinylpyrrolidone, 2 g bovine serum albumin). Amplifications consisted of 30 cycles, each comprised of 30 s at 94 1C, 30 s at 60 1C
and 60 s at 72 1C. The program was initiated by 5 min at 95 1C and terminated
with 10 min at 72 1C. The method was validated on a panel of genomic DNAs
from Actinoallomurus strains and from negative controls (strains belonging
to other Actinobacteria genera, including other Thermomonosporaceae).
The expected 0.34 kbp fragment was obtained only from strains whose 16S
rRNA gene sequence clearly clustered within Actinoallomurus.

Antimicrobial assays
MeOH extracts of cultures were prepared as follows: 450 ml of broth culture
was shaken at 1400 r.p.m. with 900 ml MeOH for 1 h at 40 1C. The mycelium
was removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was evaporated under
vacuum and resuspended in 100 ml of 10% DMSO. Occasionally, bioactivity
was determined employing agar plugs cut from 7 to 10-day-old S15.5 plates.
Agar plugs or 20 ml of the resuspended MeOH extract were deposited on 4-mm
thick Müller Hinton Agar (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA) plates,
inoculated with 105 c.f.u. ml 1 S. aureus ATCC 6538P, with 105 c.f.u. ml 1
Escherichia coli K2526 (a DtolC derivative of MG1655), or with 104 c.f.u. ml 1
Candida albicans SKF 2270 (in the latter case, the medium was supplemented
with 2% glucose). Plates were incubated overnight at 37 1C before scoring the
inhibition halos.

Metabolite identification
Metabolites were extracted from liquid cultures by adding two volumes of
MeOH to the entire culture and thoroughly mixing for 1 h at 50 1C. After
centrifugation, the liquid phase was dried under vacuum and dissolved in
0.5 ml 10% DMSO per ml of original culture. An aliquot was fractionated on a
Shimadzu Series 10 system (Kyoto, Japan), equipped with a reversed-phase
column, Lichrosorb RP-18, 5 mm, 4250 mm (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)
and a diode array detector, using a linear gradient of 0.05 M ammonium
formate-acetonitrile (from 5 to 90% of organic phase in 30 min) at a flow rate
of 1 ml min 1. Fractions (1 ml) from the HPLC column were collected, dried
and resuspended in 100 ml 10% DMSO, and 20 ml was tested for bioactivity.
Preparative HPLC employed a Shimadzu Series 10 spectrophotometer,
Merck Lichrosphere C18 4.6100-mm column, diode array detector (190–
800 nm), using a linear gradient of eluents A (0.1% TFA in 0.05 M HCOONH4)
and B (acetonitrile) from 5 to 90% B in 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1.
Reversed-phase medium pressure liquid chromatography was performed on a
Combiflash ISCO (Teledyne ISCO, Lincoln, NE, USA) RP18 12 g column, with
a 20-min linear gradient from 5 to 90% eluent B in 20 min at 18 ml min 1.

2D-NMR spectra (COSY, TOCSY, NOESY, HSQC, HMBC) were measured in
DMSO-d6, CDCl3 or MeOD-d4, on Bruker 400 or 600 MHz instruments.
The UV properties and mass data of the molecules present in the active
fractions were queried against the ABL database, which contains data on
approximately 29 000 microbial metabolites published up to 2006. An earlier
version of the database was previously described.30

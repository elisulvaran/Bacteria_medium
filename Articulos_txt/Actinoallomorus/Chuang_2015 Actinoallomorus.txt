Abstract A novel endophytic actinomycete, strain
NEAU-TX1-15T, was isolated from moss, collected
from Wuchang, Heilongjiang province, north China.
A polyphasic taxonomic study was carried out to
establish the status of strain NEAU-TX1-15T. Morphological and chemotaxonomic properties of strain
NEAU-TX1-15T are consistent with the description of
the genus Actinoallomurus. Strain NEAU-TX1-15T
was observed to form short spiral or looped spore
chains on aerial hyphae. The cell wall peptidoglycan
was found to contain lysine and meso-diaminopimelic
acid. The major menaquinones were identified as
MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8). The only phospholipid

identified was phosphatidylglycerol. The major fatty
acid was identified as iso-C16:0. Analysis of the 16S
rRNA gene sequence supports the assignment of the
novel strain to the genus Actinoallomurus, as it
exhibits 99.2 % gene sequence similarity to that of
Actinoallomurus yoronensis NBRC 103686T. However, the low level of DNA–DNA relatedness allowed
the strain to be differentiated from its close relative.
Moreover, strain NEAU-TX1-15T could also be
differentiated from A. yoronensis NBRC 103686T
and other Actinoallomurus species showing high 16S
rRNA gene sequence similarity ([98.0 %) by cultural
and physiological characteristics. Therefore, the combination of phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data, and
the DNA–DNA hybridization value, indicated that
strain NEAU-TX1-15T represents a novel species of
the genus Actinoallomurus for which the name
Actinoallomurus bryophytorum sp. nov. is proposed.
The type strain is NEAU-TX1-15T (=CGMCC
4.7200T = JCM 30340T).

People’s Republic of China

The genus Actinoallomurus was first proposed by
Tamura et al. (2009), with Actinoallomurus spadix
designated as the type species of the genus. Members
of the genus Actinoallomurus produce chains of

123

454

hooked or looped spores on aerial hyphae. The genus
is characterised chemotaxonomically by the presence
of meso-diaminopimelic acid and lysine in the cell
wall, madurose as diagnostic sugar in the whole cell
hydrolysates, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol as diagnostic phospholipids, and
MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8) as major menaquinones
(Tamura et al. 2009; Thamchaipenet et al. 2010;
Indananda et al. 2011). At the time of writing, the
genus Actinoallomurus comprises 15 species with
validly published names (http://www.bacterio.net/
actinoallomurus.html).
As part of a programme to research the diversity of
endophytic actinomycetes in moss and to discover
novel actinomycetes, an aerobic actinomycete, strain
NEAU-TX1-15T, was isolated. In this study, we
performed polyphasic taxonomy on this strain, and
propose that strain NEAU-TX1-15T represents a new
species of the genus Actinoallomurus, named Actinoallomurus bryophytorum sp. nov.

3 agar at 28 °C for 5 weeks. Cultural characteristics
were determined after 3 weeks at 28 °C using International Streptomyces Project (ISP) media 2–7 (Shirling and Gottlieb 1966), oatmeal-nitrate agar (JCM
medium 52) and 1/10 yeast extract-starch (YS) agar
(NBRC medium No.1053). The colours of colonies
and soluble pigment were determined using the ISCCNBS colour charts standard samples No 2106 (Kelly
1964). Growth at different temperatures (4, 10, 15, 20,
28, 37, 40 and 45 °C) was determined on ISP 3
medium after incubation for 21 days. The pH range for
growth (pH 4–12, at intervals of 1 pH units) was tested
in ISP 2 broth using the buffer system described by Xu
et al. (2005), and NaCl tolerance was determined in
ISP 2 broth supplemented with 1–7 % NaCl (w/v) at
28 °C for 21 days on a rotary shaker. Production of
catalase, esterase and urease were tested as described
by Smibert and Krieg (1994). The utilisation of sole
carbon and nitrogen sources, decomposition of cellulose, hydrolysis of starch and aesculin, reduction of
nitrate, peptonization and coagulation of milk, liquefaction of gelatin and production of H2S were
examined as described previously (Gordon et al.
1974; Yokota et al. 1993).

Isolation and maintenance of the organism
Chemotaxonomic characterization
Strain NEAU-TX1-15T was isolated from moss collected from Wuchang, Heilongjiang province, north
China (44°150 N, 127°540 E). The plant sample was
processed as described by Wang et al. (2013) and
placed on a plate of humic acid-vitamin agar
(Hayakawa and Nonomura 1987) supplemented with
cycloheximide (50 mg l-1) and nalidixic acid
(20 mg l-1). After 14 days of aerobic incubation at
28 °C, colonies were transferred and purified on
International Streptomyces Project (ISP) 3 medium
(Shirling and Gottlieb 1966) and maintained as
glycerol suspensions (20 %, v/v) at -80 °C. The type
strain of Actinoallomurus yoronensis was purchased
from NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC) and
cultured under the same conditions for comparative
analysis.
Morphological, cultural and physiological
characteristics
Morphology properties were observed by light microscopy (Nikon ECLIPSE E200) and electron microscopy (Hitachi S-3400N) using cultures grown on ISP

123

Biomass for chemical studies was prepared by growing the strain in ISP 2 broth in Erlenmeyer flasks at
28 °C for 21 days. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with distilled water and freeze-dried.
The isomers of diaminopimelic acid (DAP) in the
whole cell hydrolysates were derivatised according to
McKerrow et al. (2000) and analysed by a HPLC
method using an Agilent TC-C18 Column (250 9
4.6 mm i.d. 5 lm) with a mobile phase consisting of
acetonitrile: 0.05 mol l-1 phosphate buffer pH 7.2
(15:85, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1. An Agilent
G1321A fluorescence detector was used for peak
detection with a 365 nm excitation and 455 nm
longpass emission filters. The whole cell sugars were
analysed according to the procedures developed by
Lechevalier and Lechevalier (1980). The acyl type of
muramic acids in the cell wall was analysed by using
the method of Uchida and Aida (1984). The phospholipids were examined by two-dimensional TLC and
identified using the method of Minnikin et al. (1984).
Menaquinones were extracted from freeze-dried
biomass and purified according to Collins (1985).

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (2015) 108:453–459

Extracts were analysed by a HPLC–UV method using
an Agilent Extend-C18 Column (150 9 4.6 mm, i.d.
5 lm), typically at 270 nm. The mobile phase was
acetonitrile: iso-propyl alcohol (60:40, v/v) and the
flow rate was set to 1.0 ml min-1 and the run time was
60 min. The injection volume was 20 ll, and the
chromatographic column was controlled at 40 °C (Wu
et al. 1989). Mycolic acids were checked by the acid
methanolysis method as described previously (Minnikin et al. 1980). To determine cellular fatty acid
composition, strain NEAU-TX1-15T was cultivated in
ISP 2 medium in shake flasks at 28 °C for 21 days.
Fatty acid methyl esters were extracted from the
biomass as described by Gao et al. (2014) and analysed
by GC–MS using the method of Xiang et al. (2011).
DNA preparation, amplification and determination
of 16S rRNA gene sequence
Extraction of chromosomal DNA and PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene sequence were carried out
using a standard procedure (Kim et al. 2000). The PCR
product was purified and cloned into the vector
pMD19-T (Takara) and sequenced by using an Applied
Biosystems DNA sequencer (model 3730XL). An
almost full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence (1508 nt)
was obtained. The EzTaxon server (Kim et al. 2012)
was employed to identify the phylogenetic neighbours
and calculate the pairwise 16S rRNA gene sequence
similarities. The 16S rRNA gene sequence was aligned
with multiple sequences obtained from the GenBank/
EMBL/DDBJ databases using Clustal X 1.83 software.
Phylogenetic trees were generated with the neighbourjoining (Saitou and Nei 1987) and maximum-likelihood
(Felsenstein 1981) algorithms using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) software version
5.05 (Tamura et al. 2011). The stability of the clades in
the trees was appraised using a bootstrap value of 1000
(Felsenstein 1985). A distance matrix was generated
using the Kimura’s two-parameter model (Kimura
1980). All positions containing gaps and missing data
were eliminated from the dataset (complete deletion
option).
DNA base composition and DNA–DNA
hybridization
The G?C content of the genomic DNA was determined by the thermal denaturation method as

455

described by Mandel and Marmur (1968), and
Escherichia coli JM109 was used as the reference
strain. DNA–DNA relatedness test between strain
NEAU-TX1-15T and A. yoronensis NBRC 103686T
was carried out as described by De Ley et al. (1970)
under consideration of the modifications described by
Huss et al. (1983), using a model Cary 100 Bio UV/
Vis-spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier-thermostatted 6 9 6 multicell changer and a temperature
controller with in situ temperature probe (Varian). The
concentration and purity of DNA samples were
determined by measuring the optical density at 260,
280 and 230 nm. The DNA samples used for
hybridization were diluted to OD260 around 1.0 using
0.1 9 SSC (saline sodium citrate buffer), then sheared
using a JY92-II ultrasonic cell disruptor (ultrasonic
time 3 s, interval time 4 s, 90 times). The DNA
renaturation rates were determined in 2 9 SSC at
70 °C. The experiments were performed with three
replications and the DNA–DNA relatedness values
were expressed as mean of the three values.

Results and discussion
The morphological characteristics of strain NEAUTX1-15T are consistent with those of members of the
genus Actinoallomurus. Strain NEAU-TX1-15T was
observed to produce branched and non-fragmented
well-developed substrate mycelium. The tips of the
aerial mycelium divide into short hooked or looped
spore chains with smooth surfaces at maturity
(Fig. 1). Sporangia were not observed. Cultural
characteristics of strain NEAU-TX1-15T are given
in Supplementary Table S1. Good growth was
observed on ISP 3 and oatmeal-nitrate agar; moderate
growth on ISP 2, ISP 5 and ISP 7 agar; no growth on
ISP 4, ISP 6 agar and 1/10 yeast extract-starch (YS)
agar. Sparce whitish aerial mycelium was found to be
present on ISP 3 and oatmeal-nitrate agar. The colour
of the substrate mycelium on the media tested was
observed to vary from yellowish white to olive black.
Soluble or melanoid pigments were not observed to
be produced on all tested media. The growth of strain
NEAU-TX1-15T was observed at 20–37 °C (optimum 28 °C), pH ranges 6–8 (optimum pH 7) and in
the presence of 0–1 % NaCl (w/v). Detailed physiological characteristics are presented in the species
description.

The cell wall of strain NEAU-TX1-15T was found
to contain lysine and meso-diaminopimelic acid as the
diamino acids of peptidoglycan. Whole cell hydrolysate was found to contain galactose and madurose.
Phosphatidylglycerol was detected but diphosphatidylglycerol was not found (Supplementary Fig.
S1). Strain NEAU-TX1-15T was found to contain
MK-9(H6) (53.4 %) and MK-9(H8) (40.2 %) as major
menaquinones, along with a small amount of MK9(H2) (6.5 %). The major fatty acids were identified as
iso-C16:0 (32.8 %), C17:1x7c (14.2 %) and anteisoC17:0 (10.5 %) (Supplementary Table S2). The acyl
type of the muramic acid was determined to be Nacetyl. Mycolic acids were not detected. It is evident
that the chemotaxonomic characteristics of strain
NEAU-TX1-15T also support its classification as a
member of the genus Actinoallomurus.
The almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence
(1508 nt) of strain NEAU-TX1-15T was determined
and deposited as KJ425409 in the GenBank/EMBL/
DDBJ databases. Based on analysis using EzTaxon-e,
strain NEAU-TX1-15T was affiliated to the genus
Actinoallomurus and to be closely related to A.
yoronensis NBRC 103686T (99.2 %); lower sequence
similarities (\99.0 %) were found with the type
strains of all other members of the genus Actinoallomurus with validly published names. The phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed
that strain NEAU-TX1-15T formed a distinct branch
with its closest neighbour A. yoronensis NBRC
103686T, supported by a bootstrap value of 96 % in
the neighbour-joining tree (Fig. 2) and also recovered
with the maximum-likelihood algorithm (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, DNA–DNA relatedness
between strain NEAU-TX1-15T and A. yoronensis
NBRC 103686T revealed a value of 47.2 ± 0.4 %

123

(mean value of three hybridizations), which is well
below the 70 % considered to be the threshold for
assigning strains to the same prokaryotic species
(Wayne et al. 1987). Comparison of cultural and
physiological characteristics between strain NEAUTX1-15T and A. yoronensis NBRC 103686T were
performed to differentiate them. Differential characteristics include their clearly different colony colours
after growth on ISP 3 and ISP 7 agar at 28 °C for
21 days (Supplementary Fig. S3), pH and temperature
ranges of growth, liquefaction of gelatin, decomposition of urea and patterns of carbon and nitrogen
utilisation (Table 1). In addition, a comparative study
between strain NEAU-TX1-15T and closely related
type strains of the genus Actinoallomurus ([98.0 %)
revealed that it differed from them in physiological
and biochemical characteristics as summarised in
Table 1.
In conclusion, it is evident from the genotypic and
phenotypic data that strain NEAU-TX1-15T represents
a novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus, for
which the name Actinoallomurus bryophytorum sp.
nov. is proposed.

a b s t r a c t
In this paper, we employ atomic force microscopy (AFM), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
(FRAP) technique, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) and MiSeq analysis to study the effects of traditional
dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (0.71–1.32 mg/L, 2.13–3.02 mg/L and 4.31–5.16 mg/L) on surface force, cell
membrane properties and microbial community dynamics of activated sludge. Results showed that low
DO level enhanced the surface force and roughness of activated sludge; the medium DO level decreased
cell membrane fluidity by reducing the synthesis of branched fatty acids in the cell membrane; high DO
level resulted in the highest protein content in the effluent by EEM scanning. Abundance of Micropruina,
Zoogloea and Nakamurella increased and Paracoccus and Rudaea decreased with the increase of DO levels.
RDA analysis suggested that saturated fatty acids (SFA), anteiso-fatty acids (AFA) and iso-fatty acids (IFA)
were closely related to effluent quality as well as some genera.

of activated sludge (AS) (Liao et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2013; Miao
et al., 2015; Yadav et al., 2014).
Many reports have focused on the effects of DO levels on the
characteristics of activated sludge, especially on the extracellular
polymeric substances (EPS) (Liao et al., 2011; Martins et al.,
2003). An appropriate level of DO is beneficial to the performance
of WWTPs. A high level of DO can result in an increase of dissolved
organic matter concentration through erosion of bound extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which consequently deteriorate
effluent quality and increase operating costs (Ma et al., 2013). In
the meantime, a low DO adversely affects treatment efficiencies
and causes sludge bulking, especially in industrial sewage (Zheng

646

S.-j. Ma et al. / Bioresource Technology 214 (2016) 645–652

et al., 2011). Recently, it has been reported that low DO levels promote the proliferation of polyphosphate accumulating organisms
over glycogen accumulating organisms, thus increase the WWTPs
efficiency (Carvalheira et al., 2014). However, few researches have
addressed the influence of the DO levels on the cell membrane
characteristics of AS rather than merely the expected effects on
intracellular and extracellular polymers in activated sludge
process.
Presently, changes in cell membrane characteristics of single
bacteria have been reported based on their response to heavy metals, low temperature and organic solvents (Fang et al., 2004; Fang
et al., 2007; Niu et al., 2012; Ramos et al., 2002), but few investigators have reported the effects of DO levels on microbial cell membrane properties in activated sludge. Cell membrane fluidity is
essential for many biological membrane functions, such as the passive permeability of molecules and active solute transport
(Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 2001; Van Meer et al., 2008). The fluidity of cell membrane strongly influences the transportation and
extrusion of many structurally and functionally unrelated compounds, which may have a significant effect on wastewater treatment efficiency and soluble microbial products (SMP) (Ramos
et al., 2002). Membranes appear to have specific lipid constituents
to maintain fluidity and the ability to transport nutrients under
various stress conditions (Niu et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2014). Therefore, when environment changes, the microbes regulate the composition of the membrane lipids to maintain the fluidity and
membrane phase behavior, to minimize energy expenditure, and
optimize growth. Understanding the bacterial cell membrane
properties in activated sludge processes and analyzing the shifts
in responding to different DO levels are essential to develop efficient treatment strategies. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) measurements and FRAP analysis had been used to analyze
cell membrane fluidity (Fang et al., 2007; Mullineaux et al., 2006);
and Agilent 7890 Gas Chromatography with flame ionization
detector (FID) was widely used to detected cell membrane phospholipid compositions (Niu et al., 2012). It has been reported that
unsaturated fatty acids and branched fatty acids can disrupt the
close packing of phospholipid acyl chains and lower the temperature of the phase transition (Kaneda, 1991; Niu et al., 2012). Fang
et al. (2004) reported that in aerobic conditions, apolar organics
could cause a decrease in the amount of unsaturated fatty acids
of Pseudomonas putida. Chang et al. (2011) reported that an
increase of aeration off time could decrease monounsaturated fatty
acids content and increase branched fatty acids content in submerged membrane bioreactor. Niu et al. (2012) reported that low
temperature resulted in an increase of unsaturated fatty acids of
activated sludge. Fang et al. (2007) reported that 0.01 mol/L of
nC60 (fullerene water suspensions) decreased the amount of unsaturated fatty acids and increased the content of branched fatty acids
of Bacillus subtilis, which led to an increase of cell membrane fluidity where oxygen was absent. The effects of operating parameters
on activated sludge microbial cell membrane properties are limited
to low temperature or other rigidifying conditions (Niu et al., 2012;
Niu et al., 2013). Shifts of microbial cell membrane properties
(PLFA and fluidity) in response to different DO levels and the
changes with time under same DO levels in activated sludge are
still unclear. Analysis of this constituent would be helpful to
enhance treatment efficiency and decrease SMP content in activated sludge.
Environmental conditions (such as pH, temperature and DO)
have significant influence on microbial ecology (Yang et al.,
2011). The PLFA composition and SMP were determined by microbiota in activated sludge. Therefore, investigation of microbial
community might provide insights into how DO levels influence
effluent quality. However, most related investigations are contradictory and the relationship between DO levels and microbial com-

munity is still unclear in activated sludge. For example, Tocchi
et al. (2012) reported that microbial communities under a high
DO level (8.9 mg/L) exhibit a great similarity (80%) to those under
moderate DO level (3.1 mg/L). It also has been reported that DO
levels significantly affect the microbial community structure,
including Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Nitrospira, Bacteroidetes
and so on (Xin et al., 2016; Yadav et al., 2014; Zhang et al.,
2012).Therefore, the structural changes of microbial communities
in responding to different DO levels should be meaningfully characterized. The MiSeq platform (Illumina, Inc., USA) provides a way
to achieve high-through-put sequencing, which enables microbial
ecology the greatest coverage and most accurate DNA data for
analysis of the microbial community in various environmental
samples (Yadav et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2015).
The objectives of this study were to: (1) compare the effluent
dissolved organics matters of the three SBRs with different DO
levels fed with a synthetic wastewater; (2) investigate surface
morphology and mechanics characteristics of sludge, cell membrane physiological properties including membrane phospholipids
composition and membrane fluidity, and; (3) investigate the
microbial community structures, and the effects of microbial community structures changes on membrane physiological properties.
Those findings would be helpful to the development of strategies
to minimize energy consumption and optimize performance in
WWTPs.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Aerobic sequencing batch reactors (SBRs)
The laboratory experimental system consists of three parallel
SBRs (total and effective volume: 2.5 and 2 L, respectively), operated at DO of 0.71–1.32 mg/L (reactor A), 2.13–3.02 mg/L (reactor
B) and 4.31–5.16 mg/L (reactor C) with the help of three rotameters. The oxygen concentration in the reactors was monitored
using an oxygen meter and probe (SG6, METTLER TOLEDO Inc.,
USA). The seeding sludge was collected from Jiangxinzhou municipal WWTP in Nanjing, China and the MLSS of each SBR was about
3000 mg/L fed with synthetic wastewater. One liter of synthetic
wastewater contained 400 mg of glucose, 120 mg of NH4Cl,
19 mg of KH2PO4, 25 mg of MgSO47H2O, 11 mg of CaCl22H2O
and 0.6 mL of a trace metals solution, yield an influent COD of
400 ± 20 mg/L. One liter of the trace metals solution contained:
1.5 g FeCl36H2O, 0.15 g H3BO3, 0.03 g CuSO45H2O, 0.18 g KI,
0.12 g MnCl24H2O, 0.06 g Na2MoO42H2O, 0.12 g ZnSO47H2O,
0.15 g CoCl26H2O and 10 g EDTA. The SBRs were operated at a cyclic time of 12 h. The time of filling, reaction, settling and discharging was 10, 660, 40, and 10 min, respectively. The hydraulic
retention time (HRT) was 11 h at a solid retention time (SRT) for
10 days (Niu et al., 2012; He et al., 2016). The temperature during
the operation was 25 ± 2 °C for the three reactors. The pH was
adjusted to 7 ± 0.1 before reaction of the three reactors at each
cycle using a pH meter and probe (FE20, METTLER TOLEDO Inc.,
USA), respectively. 1 L of the synthetic wastewater was added to
each SBR in each cycle. The mixing intensity in each SBR was made
similar by setting the same rotating speed of the electric mixer in
each SBR.
2.2. Water chemistry analysis
Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was determined according to
standard methods and effluent protein content was determined
by the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard, the references were provided in Supplementary Material.
The samples for these measurements were taken from the SBRs

S.-j. Ma et al. / Bioresource Technology 214 (2016) 645–652

at the end of settling period (COD and SMP) and at 0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h,
5 h, 7 h, 9 h, and 11 h of the reaction period (COD removal efficiency at a single cycle). Fluorescence EEMs were measured using
the method described in Huang et al. (2014).
2.3. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)
AFM has been exploited to characterize microbial surface in
terms of structure and function with higher resolution, surface feature and force measurement (Zhu et al., 2015).The activated sludge
samples on the 30th day were observed with AFM after drying naturally. The adhesion force between tips and cells was analyzed by
force-distance measurement (Zhu et al., 2015). Images and forcedistance curves of the sludge were recorded using an AFM (Multimode 8, Bruker Inc., Germany) and scanned in a contact mode
using a silicon nitride cantilever with a spring constant of
0.2113 N/m at speed of 1.99 Hz with 256  256 resolutions. The
entire process was repeated three times.
2.4. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements
and data analysis
The techniques described and illustrated in Mullineaux et al.
(2006) were used to measure the diffusion coefficients for the
BODIPY FL-C12-tagged plasma membrane lipid on the 30th day.
For FRAP measurement, 1 mL of activated sludge suspension was
diluted with Milli-Q water by 1:100. A 2.4 mmol/L stock solution
of dimethyl sulphoxide was added to the cell suspension to give
a final concentration of 1 lmol/L. The suspension was incubated
for approximately 30 min in the presence of BODIPY, then harvested by centrifugation at room temperature and washed several
times in synthetic wastewater to remove unincorporated dye.
Images were recorded with a laser scanning confocal microscope
(LSCM, FV1000, Olympus Co., Japan) equipped with a 10 mW argon
laser and BODIPY fluorescence emissions were selected using
green (515–565 nm) filters. Experimental protocol: First, adjust
the argon laser to 2 mW; then, scan in the xy plane to record the
sample image. Select an appropriate small region in the image as
the bleaching area. Second, focus an argon laser light run at
10 mW on the selected area. Turn off the argon laser after irreversibly bleaching the bound reagent for five minutes. Third, the
fluorescence of the bleached area increased as unbleached fluorescent lipids diffused into it along with time bleached ones. Bleaching was recorded at 488 nm and fluorescence emission was
detected between 520 and 545 nm. Pre- and post-bleach scans
were recorded separately at 2 min intervals over a 512  512 pixel
area using the xy mode for scanning. Further statistical analyses
were made using the OLYMPUS FV1000 Ver.1.7b Viewer. The
mobile fraction Mf from FRAP experiments was determined by
Mf = (Ft F0)/(Fi F0) where Ft is the fluorescence in the bleached
region after full recovery, Fi is the fluorescence before bleaching
and F0 is the fluorescence just after bleaching (LippincottSchwartz et al., 2001).
2.5. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis
The PLFA were extracted from activated sludge on the 15th and
30th day according to the method described by Niu et al. (2012).
Briefly, 5 mL of static settlement activated sludge was extracted
with a chloroform–methanol-phosphate buffer mixture (v/v/v,
1:2:0.8). A silicic acid column was used to separate the phospholipid from other lipids. Saponification was carried out with a
sodium hydroxide-methanol-distilled water mixture (m/v/v,
45:150:150) and methylation with a mixture of hydrochloric
acid–methanol (v/v, 325:275). After extraction and lavation, the
resulting fatty acid methyl esters were detected by Aglient 7890

647

GC, and the results were analyzed using the MIDI Sherlock Microbial Identification System (MIDI, Newark, DE). Fatty acid was classified in terms of total number of carbon atoms, with the number
of double bonds given after a colon, following the form A:BxC,
where A is the number of carbon atoms, B is the number of double
bonds, and C is the position of the first double bond from the
‘‘omega” or the molecule’s aliphatic end. The prefixes ‘‘i” and ‘‘a”
indicate ‘‘iso” and ‘‘anteiso” branching, respectively.

2.6. Procedure of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and data
analysis
The microbial community structures were investigated using
MiSeq platform on the 15th and 30th day. Activated sludge for
the 16S rRNA gene sequencing amplicon were first processed as
follows: DNA extraction, 16S rRNA gene PCR amplification and
PCR products purification (Zhu et al., 2015). To amplify and
sequence the V1V2 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, forward primer (50-AGAGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG-30) and the reverse
primer (50-TGCTGCCTCCCGTAGGAGT-30) were selected and different 8-base barcodes and a guanine were linked to the 50 end
of each primer. Then the purified products were sent for sequencing using Illumina sequencing platform (MiSeq, Illumina Inc., USA).
The acquired data was processed by the Sickle and Mothur program to remove the low quality of sequence and reduce noises.
Lastly, the filtered sequences were assigned to a taxon by an RDP
classifier. Microbial abundance at the genus level was mapped
using heatmap modules in ‘‘R” statistical packages. The specific
methods and data analysis are available in the supplemental material. Redundancy analysis (RDA) based on the community composition and the measured variables (PLFA compositions and
effluent organics matters) were performed with CANOCO 4.5 software. The Significant Correlation (P) of the correlations among different parameters was calculated using SPSS 19.0 software.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Overall performance of the three sequencing batch reactors (SBRs)
As shown in Fig. S1a, in the beginning of the experimental runs,
a period of time was set to allow the three SBRs (A, B, and C) to
adapt to the different DO levels. When operated at DO of 2.13–
3.02 mg/L, COD of effluent was the lowest at this period. All the
reactors achieved steady operation status after running 15 days,
and the COD removal efficiencies were higher than 85% under all
operation conditions. The average COD removal efficiency
decreased with the decline of DO concentration: Reactor C (4.31–
5.16 mg/L, 94.1%) > Reactor B (2.13–3.02 mg/L, 92.3%) > Reactor A
(0.71–1.32 mg/L, 89.9%). It is agreed with the findings that an
increase of DO levels could led to an increase of COD removal efficiency (Yadav et al., 2014). At a single cycle of the operation of each
reactor, COD removal efficiency was detected and noted when all
the reactors achieved steady operation status (Fig. S1b). It suggested that at the first hour the COD removal rate increased as follows: Reactor C (4.31–5.16 mg/L, 32.3%) < Reactor B (2.13–
3.02 mg/L, 41.2%) < Reactor A (0.71–1.32 mg/L, 56.7%). It is consistent with the findings that at the first hour in one cycle, the COD
removal efficiencies were higher at aeration intensity of 0.2–
0.4 MPa than 0.6 MPa (Xin et al., 2016). This sequence changed
with the fast increasing of COD removal efficiencies of Reactor C,
which got the largest COD removal efficiency at the second hour.
Liao et al. (2011) reported that an increase in the DO level resulted
in a higher COD removal rate of activated sludge under thermophilic conditions. Recently, Xin et al. (2016) also confirmed this

648

phenomenon by finding that higher aeration pressure resulted in
more excellent nutrients removal performance.
The results of excitation–emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence
spectra showed in Fig. 1. EEM spectrum showed that aromatic
protein-like (peak at Ex/Em = 280–285/305–310 and peak at Ex/
Em = 228–235/330–340), humic acid-like (peak at Ex/Em = 340–
345/380–390) and fulvic acid-like (Ex/Em = 240–250/460–475)
substances presented in the effluent according to the method from
Chen et al. (2003) and Zhu et al. (2012). The fluorescence intensity
of spectra was listed in Table 1. Aromatic protein-like and fulvic
acid-like were two major substances in the effluent dissolved
organic matter on the 15th day. At day 30, the fluorescence intensity of fulvic acid-like and aromatic protein-like decreased while
the humic acid-like substance enriched. Analysis of the treated
effluent showed that the content of proteins increased as follows:
Reactor B (3.6 ± 0.5 mg/L) < Reactor A (7.3 ± 0.6 mg/L) < Reactor C
(10.8 ± 1.5 mg/L). The highest protein content in effluent was at
Reactor C, which is similar with the findings that higher shear condition (DO was about 6 mg/L) resulted in the increase of SMP concentrations in membrane bioreactors (Menniti et al., 2010). The
results suggested that a moderate DO level (2.13–3.02 mg/L) can
result in the lowest protein content in effluent of SBRs.
3.2. Roughness and adhesion force of sludge
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provided important morphology features and mechanical characteristics and was thus used to
detect microscale images and surface properties of the sludge samples on the 30th day (Fig. S2). The floc architecture of activated
sludge at different DO levels was obviously different. The adhesion
forces of sludge for Reactors A, B and C were 29.1 ± 2.2 nN,
12.1 ± 0.27 nN and 7.4 ± 0.35 nN (Table 2), respectively. This indicates that the increase of DO level leads to a decrease of adhesion
force. The Ra roughness for Reactors A, B and C were

246.5 ± 37.1 nm, 81.7 ± 3.4 nm and 86.6 ± 1.2 nm (Table 2),
respectively.
In wastewater treatment, organics removal consists of two
steps: adsorption and degradation. It has been reported that an
increase of adhesion force could facilitate the bacterial interactions
or the adhesion between carbohydrate and specific receptors (such
as concanavalin A receptor surfaces) in biological processes
(Pussak et al., 2014). But Li et al. (2014) reported that no significant
correlation was found between adhesion energy and microbial
aggregation or transport behavior. As shown in Fig. 1b, at the first
hour in one operating cycle, the removal of COD were 226.8 mg/L,
164.8 mg/L and 129.2 mg/L at Reactors A (0.71–1.32 mg/L), B
(2.13–3.02 mg/L), and C (4.31–5.16 mg/L), respectively. This results
indicate that a decrease of DO level may facilitate the adhesion
between glucose and cell surface in activated sludge, thus promote
the COD removal at the first hour. Physicochemical properties present on the outer cell membrane are known to affect the organics
adhesion and transportation behavior (Li et al., 2014). Tansel et al.
(2006) reported that with the increase of membrane roughness
during filtration, the amount of EPS deposited on the membranes
increased significantly. Niu et al. (2013) reported that at low temperature under heteropolar magnetic field treatment, the cells of
activated sludge appeared a lower roughness, which may be conducive to the interaction between cells and absorption of nutrient
to a certain extent, improving mass transfer effect. In this study, it
means that substance transportation through the outer cell membrane was easier at DO of 2.13–3.02 mg/L. All results reflected the
influence of DO on the morphology characteristics and mechanical
properties of sludge.
3.3. Fluidity of cell membrane in activated sludge
Cell membrane fluidity is essential for many biological membrane functions, such as mass transfer (Lippincott-Schwartz

et al., 2001). It has been reported that the changes of cell membrane fluidity might be a mechanism of microbes to maintain substance transportation and optimal growth (Fang et al., 2007). The
effects of DO levels on the fluidity of cell membranes were studied
by measuring the diffusion coefficients for BODIPY FL-C12labeled
plasma membrane lipids (Mullineaux et al., 2006). The diffusion
coefficient of lipids in the membrane can be calculated from the
extent of recovery of fluorescence in the bleached patch (Fig. S3).
The rate of fluorescence recovery is proportional to the rate of
labeled molecules move into the bleached area. Under laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), microorganisms displayed green
colors after binding with BODIPY FL-C12 and the red circle was used
to limit the bleached area. The percentage of fluorescence intensity
of recovery rates could be used to represent the fluidity of cell
membranes. As shown in Table 3, Reactor C, operating at DO of
4.31–5.16 mg/L had the fastest rate of fluorescence recovery while
Reactor B, operating at DO of 2.13–3.02 mg/L had the lowest with
substantial mobile fraction (Mf) as follows: Reactor B (40.4%)
< Reactor A (46.1%) < Reactor C (49.3%). It has been reported that
the change of cell membrane fluidity may be a mechanism to adapt
to environmental changes (Fang et al., 2007). Niu et al. (2012)
reported that low temperature could led to an increase of unsaturated fatty acids and thus promote the cell membrane fluidity of
activated sludge, which can enhance the mass transfer efficiency
of cells.
It has been reported that microorganisms can catalyze the
active extrusion of many structurally and functionally unrelated
compounds from bacterial cytoplasm to external media for optimal
growth. The change in cell membrane fluidity is the key to implementing this self-defense function (Ramos et al., 2002). The
changes of cell membrane fluidity under DO levels of 0.71–
1.32 mg/L, 2.13–3.02 mg/L and 4.31–5.16 mg/L were consistent
with the different effluent protein content. This discovery might
be useful for reducing the content of EfOM or DON in the effluent.

3.4. Phospholipid fatty acids of microbes in sludge
The cell membrane lipid composition changes of microbes were
studied by PLFA analysis (Fig. 2 and Table S1). A-15 represents the
activated sludge samples of A on the 15th day, and so on. The content of saturated fatty acids all had an increase from the 15th day
to 30th day and Reactor B had the highest proportion. At Reactors A

the 15th day, the proportions of unsaturated fatty acids were
7.44 ± 0.77%, 15.37 ± 1.93% and 16.27 ± 2.23%, and breached fatty
acids were 58.82 ± 7.93%, 34.06 ± 0.98% and 49.23 ± 5.91%, respectively. When the three reactors maintained for 30 days (>3 SRT),
the branched fatty acids content at the three reactors (A, B and
C) all had a decrease, respectively (34.89 ± 0.33%, 27.94 ± 4% and
38.43 ± 3.44%). The unsaturated fatty acids content at Reactors B
and C continuously decreased (13.19 ± 2.23% and 10.4 ± 1.92%)
but at Reactor A had a slight increase (10.29 ± 0.66%).
It has been reported that the increase of unsaturated fatty acids
can enhance the mass transfer efficiency of cells, which is necessary for efficient metabolism at low temperature (Niu et al.,
2012; Niu et al., 2013). However, Fang et al., 2007 reported that
depending on the different environments present, microbial
response may result in decreased or increased unsaturated fatty
acids. In this study, the contents of unsaturated fatty acids
decreased during the whole operation except for a slight increase
trend at Reactor A (0.71–1.32 mg/L) on the 30th day (from
7.44 ± 0.77% to 10.29 ± 0.66%).
In this study, branched fatty acids were more abundant than
unsaturated fatty acids in the whole operation (Fig. 2a).
Breached-chain fatty acids content on the 15th day were: Reactor
B (34.06 ± 0.93%) < Reactor C (49.23 ± 5.91%) < Reactor A (58.82 ± 7.93%).
It has been found that branched fatty acids are required for growth
of two mutants of B. subtilis (Kaneda, 1991). Iso- and anteisobranched fatty acids have the same ability as unsaturated fatty
acids to disrupt the close packing of phospholipid acyl chains
and lower the temperature of the phase transition (Kaneda,
1991; Niu et al., 2012). Different substrate or environments could
cause different phospholipid compositions and the increase of
breached-chain fatty acids may be a defense mechanism employed
by microorganisms responding to stress conditions (fullerene and
toluene) (Fang et al., 2007; Fang et al., 2004). In the initial stage,
microbes growing at DO of 0.71–1.32 mg/L and 4.31–5.16 mg/L,
increased the synthesis of branched fatty acids for maintaining
mass transfer and growth. When all the reactors achieved
steady operation, the microbes recompounded their lipid compositions and the contents of breached-chain fatty acids on the
30th day were as follows: Reactor B (27.94 ± 4%) < Reactor A
(34.89 ± 0.33%) < Reactor C (38.43 ± 3.44%). The branched fatty
acids content had a decrease in all reactors in comparison to the
15th day. It has been reported that the decrease of branched fatty
acids may be a defense mechanism to prevent the membrane from
being too fluid for optimal growth (Fang et al., 2007). And the
higher branched fatty acids content accounted for the faster
cell membrane fluidity at Reactors A and C in comparison to at
Reactor B.
The major branched fatty acids (abundance > 1%) on the 15th
and 30th day were C15:0 anteiso, C14:0 iso, C15:0 iso and C16:0

iso (Table S1). Especially, the C15:0 anteiso content had a significant increase as follows: Reactor B (24.36 ± 0.16%) < Reactor C
(33.31 ± 4.11%) < Reactor A (41.97 ± 3.9%). At the 30th day,
the C15:0 anteiso content had a decrease to: Reactor B
(19.40 ± 2.34%) < Reactor A (25.56 ± 0.28%) < Reactor C (25.90 ± 2.13%).
In the whole period, C15:0 anteiso was the most abundant
branched fatty acids. It has been reported that C15:0 anteiso has
the lowest phase transition temperature (23 °C) in comparison to
others (Kaneda, 1991). Therefore, microbes can better maintain
cell membrane fluidity. The results suggested that at DO of
4.31–5.16 mg/L and 0.71–1.32 mg/L, microbes can increase the
synthesis of branched fatty acids to increase the fluidity of cell
membranes for optimal growth.
From Fig. 2b, it can be seen that at Reactors A and B, the content
of C15 had a significant decrease while the content of C16 and C18
all increased distinctly on the 30th day. At Reactor C, the content of
C15 and C16 all had a slight decrease but the content of C18
increased. The results suggested that in the three reactors, the synthesis of long chain fatty acids (the number of carbons > 18)
increased when the reactors achieved steady operation stage. All
this reflected the domestication and selection of DO for plasma
membrane phospholipid fatty acids.
3.5. Shifts of microbial community structure
The microbial community structure differences in responding to
different DO levels on the 15th day and 30th day were detected by
MiSeq high-throughput sequencing (Fig. 3). Fig. 3a showed that the
microbial community at phylum level (Reactors A, B and C) dominantly consisted of Proteobacteria (64.84%, 29.2% and 74.88%), Bacteroidetes (8.24%, 22.54% and 8.16%), Actinobacteria (17.81%, 30.15%

and 11.82%) on the 15th day and Proteobacteria (19.2%, 21.79% and
20.75%), Bacteroidetes (36.2%, 12.92% and 15.33%), Actinobacteria
(4.21%, 18.7% and 19.6%) and TM7(29.2%, 35.5% and 32.4%) on the
30th day respectively. The other phylum were Acidobacteria, Nitrospira, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Verrucomicrobia,
OD1, Thermotogae and Spirochaetes. In the genus level, the content
exceeded 0.1% which was selected to generate the heat map
(Fig. 3b). The microbial community at genus level changed greatly
in the three reactors from the 15th day to 30th day.
As shown in Fig. 3a, Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum on the 15th day at Reactors A (0.71–1.32 mg/L) and C (4.31–
5.16 mg/L), which agreed with previous studies in full-scale
wastewater treatment plants (Peng et al., 2014; Zhang et al.,
2012). Recently Yadav et al. (2014) found that Proteobacteria is sensitive to oxygen levels (1–4 mg/L) in industrial wastewater treatment. At Reactor B on the 15th day, the dominant phyla were
Actinobacteria (30.15%), Proteobacteria (29.2%), Bacteroidetes
(22.54%). It has been reported that Actinobacteria is the most abundant phylum in activated sludge treating pharmaceutical and dye
wastewater (Yadav et al., 2014). Oxygen stress (1–5 mg/L)
appeared to distinctly affect the bacterial community structure in
MBR (Ma et al., 2013). After the reactors run for 30 days, the microbial community had changed greatly compared to the 15th day
(Fig. 3a). TM7 increased significantly to be the most abundant phylum at Reactor B and C on the 30th day, while Bacteroidetes was the
most abundant phylum at DO of 0.71–1.32 mg/L. The main microbial community differences among the three SBRs were the content of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Previous studies on the
features and functions of TM7 are limited (Wakelin et al., 2012).
Recently, Peng et al. (2014) showed that TM7 increases notably
in the middle of the rotating biological contactor (RBC). Some

(b) Heat map of genera in six activated sludge samples. The color bar indicates the range of the percentage of a genus in a sample, based on the color key (log 10 scale) at the
bottom right corner. Genera with abundance >0.10% were selected in each sample. A operated at DO of 0.71–1.32 mg/L, B operated at DO of 2.13–3.02 mg/L, C operated at DO
of 4.31–5.16 mg/L.

researchers reported that TM7 are filamentous bacteria and
increased during the start-up period in MBBR (Zhu et al., 2015).
Bacteroidetes plays an important role in using protein, and chitin,
and is proficient in degrading part of the high molecular mass fraction of the DOM (Ma et al., 2013). The results of this study confirmed this phenomenon by finding that the lowest protein
content in the effluent of Reactor B, with larger amount of Bacteroidetes on the 15th day; while at the 30th day, the Bacteroidetes
content in Reactor B changed to the lowest with the lowest protein
content, which means other bacteria may account for the protein
removal. Peng et al. (2014) reported that changes in microbial
communities are one of leading reasons for variations in metabolites, and such changes may have a direct effect on effluent quality.
Fig. 3b shows that Zoogloea, Leptothrix, Nakamurella, and Micropruina genera were consistently abundant in the sludge of three
reactors on the 15th day. With the reactors operation, those genera
decreased and the microbial communities changed greatly. At day
30, the most abundant genus in Reactors A, B and C was TM7 genera
incertae sedis, which has a significant increase in utilization of carbohydrates (Wakelin et al., 2012). From the heat map of the genus
relative abundances, Nakamurella and Micropruina increased with
the increase of the DO level. It has been reported that Nakamurella
and Micropruina are able to accumulate large amounts of polysaccharides in their cells (Hope et al., 2010; Begum and Batista, 2012).
Paracoccus and Rudaea decreased with the increase of DO levels.
Paracoccus, a denitrifying group, was more abundant at three reactors on the 30th day. The Zoogloea genera (0.1% in Reactor A, 0.9%
in Reactor B and 1.9% in Reactor C) were widely spread in activated
sludge and had been regarded as the key populations responsible
for the flocculation of activated sludge (Zhang et al., 2012).
3.6. Correlation analysis of microbial community with PLFA
composition and effluent quality
The RDA analysis was used to investigate the relationship of
microbial community with PLFA composition and effluent dissolved organic matter (Fig. 4). The RDA1 and RDA2 explained
85.8% and 10.3% of the total variance, respectively. TM7 genera
incertae sedis and SFA were correlated with effluent aromatic

protein-like (Peak p), humic acid-like (Peak h) and fulvic acidlike (Peak f) (Person test, p < 0.05). Prosthecobacter and Gp4 were
correlated with effluent fulvic acid-like (Person test, p < 0.05).
Besides, AFA was related to effluent aromatic protein-like and Ideonella; IFA was related to effluent aromatic protein-like and Nakamurella (Person test, p < 0.05). However, no microbial population
was found to be significantly correlated to UFA (p > 0.05). Previous
studies have proven that these PLFA and genera may significantly
influence the effluent quality (Niu et al., 2012; Yadav et al.,
2014). Some genera showed high positive correlation with AFA
and IFA, including Ideonella, Nakamurella and Zoogloea. Above
results showed that the changes of DO levels, promoted the shifts
of microbial community and the compositions of PLFA, which
influenced the effluent dissolved organic matter.

4. Conclusion
The results showed that DO of 2.13–3.02 mg/L led to the lowest
effluent dissolved organics matters content and an increase of DO
level resulted in decreasing surface adhesion force. DO of 0.71–
1.32 mg/L and 4.31–5.16 mg/L could prompt cell membrane fluidity by increasing the synthesis of branched fatty acids. It was also
found that higher abundance of bacteria which contain more
branched fatty acids resulted in the increase of fluidity and
branched fatty acids content, which further influenced the effluent
quality. SFA, AFA and IFA significantly influenced the effluent dissolved organic matter.

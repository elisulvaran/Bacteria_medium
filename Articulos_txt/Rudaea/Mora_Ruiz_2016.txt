ABSTRACT
In this study, the microbial community structures of the endosphere of the halophyte Arthrocnemum macrostachyum were
evaluated from two locations in Mallorca, Spain, focusing on three plant compartments (roots, green and red stems)
compared to the rhizospheric soil where the plants grew. The physicochemical parameters of the rhizospheric soils differed
between locations, and the soils were characterized by different microbial community structures. Accordingly, the
endophytic community composition, mainly composed of putatively halophilic organisms, was highly influenced by the
rhizospheric soil microbiota, as revealed by the co-occurrence of the major endophytic taxa in the endosphere and the
rizospheric soils. Moreover, the reduction of diversity from the endorhizosphere towards the red leaves may support the
fact that part of colonization of the plant by bacteria could have an origin in the rhizospheric soils through the roots and
subsequent migration to the aerial parts of the plant. Finally, there were certain relevant ubiquitous taxa, such as
Chromohalobacter canadensis, Rudaea cellulosilytica (never reported before as endophytic), Psychrobacter sp., Bradyrhizobium sp.
and Halomonas sp., that, due their moderate halophilic nature, seemed to find an optimal environment inside the plants.
Some of these relevant endophytes were not always detectable in their respective soils, and were probably part of the soils’
rare biosphere, which would gain preponderance in a favorable endophytic environment.

INTRODUCTION
Coastal salt marshes are inhospitable environments for the
majority of plants; nevertheless, a few highly salt-tolerant

plants (halophytes) are able to survive and flourish under such
conditions. Halophilic plants are common in coastal ecosystems around the world and present diverse adaptations to

hypersaline environments. Furthermore, some of them show no
evidence of inhibition in response to salinity stress, and normally exhibit a pronounced salt requirement for optimal growth
(Qiu and Lu 2003; Parida and Das 2005; Redondo-Gómez et al.
2010).
The halophyte Arthrocnemum macrostachyum is particularly
interesting because it is one of the few species proven to be
extremely well adapted to hypersaline conditions (RedondoGómez et al. 2010). Even though the optimum salinity in the substrate ranges from 171 to 540 mM NaCl, this species can grow
on substrates with salinities up to 1030 mM NaCl (RedondoGómez et al. 2010). As we have already reported (Mora-Ruiz
et al. 2015), the internal tissues of this plant can serve as a suitable environment for the colonization of moderately halophilic
bacteria. These are known to represent important and complex
communities associated with halophytes (Ruppel, Franken and
Witzel 2013) and, as in other plants, they might affect (positive or negatively) the fitness of A. macrostachyum. The colonization of bacteria in the internal tissues of the plants occurs
in both phyllospheric and root compartments, but both differ
importantly in the environmental conditions that may influence the structure of the colonizing microbial communities. In
this regard, the phyllosphere and rhizosphere have rather different environmental fluctuations. The first is under constant
fluctuations of temperature, humidity, UV radiation and wind,
whereas the rhizosphere can suffer strong fluctuations of water soil content and salinity. However, not much is known about
the microbial communities associated with halophytes (Simon,
Abeliovich and Belkin 1994). In general, studies have focused on
Arabidopsis thaliana (Bulgarelli et al. 2012; Bodenhausen, Horton
and Bergelson 2013) or plants with commercial interest (Wulff,
van Vuurde and Hockenhull 2003) and a description of the community structure with no information about the presence or
absence of spatial patterns of species diversity. Additionally,
in comparison with rhizosphere and green leaf habitats, little is known about microbial colonization in other plant areas
(Bulgarelli et al. 2013; Jin et al. 2014), and even less on specific
endophytic microorganisms and their biogeography at this microscale (Hoffman and Arnold 2010).
Arthrocnemum macrostachyum has very small, scale-shaped
leaves and the phyllosphere is in fact composed of succulent
and articulate stems. In addition, besides the roots and green
stems, during the dry hot seasons stems exhibit large areas
with a red-colored pigmentation. This color is generated by production of photopigments, such as anthocyanin and betacyanin
(Chang-Quan et al. 2006) among others, which protect the integrity of the photosynthetic apparatus by acting as an osmotic
buffer against the osmotic and ionic challenges of the saline environment (Kaya et al. 2001; Renault et al. 2001; Parida and Das
2005; Song et al. 2011; Flowers, Munns and Colmer 2015). The
anthocyanin helps in the elimination of oxygen radicals and inhibits the peroxidation of lipids (Chalker-Scott 1999; KhavariNejad, Najafi and Khavari-Nejad 2008). We hypothesized that
the endophytic community in the halophyte A. macrostachyum
could exhibit variations related to different compartments of
its plant structures (endorhizosphere, green and red stems)
and it would be different from the rhizospheric soil microbial
communities.
Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine whether the
three different compartments contained distinct microbial communities, and whether two different locations shared the same
community structures. For this purpose, 454-pyrosequencing of
16S rRNA amplicons was applied following the operational phylogenetic unit (OPU) approach (Mora-Ruiz et al. 2015; Fig. S1, Sup-

porting Information). The OPU approach allows the comparison
of sequences from different length and 16S rRNA gene regions
due to the nature of phylogenetic inference algorithm. Moreover,
it minimizes the overestimation of richness measures calculated with OTUs as one OPU may group distinct OTUs that would
not be recognized of being of the same unit due to differences
in length or slight sequence dissimilarities (Vidal et al. 2015).
The physicochemical characteristics of the soil from where the
samples were collected were also recorded in order to evaluate possible environmental factors that would determine the
structure of the internal bacterial communities and identify how
these environmental variables could help predict the microbial
community.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant sample collection and surface sterilization
Six halophytes, identified as Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, were
collected from Campos (39◦ 21 03.3 N, 3◦ 00 44.3 E, Spain) and
Albufera d’Alcúdia (39◦ 47 49 N, 3◦ 6 24 E, Spain) in April 2014.
Both locations are in Mallorca and are separated by a distance
of approximately 60 km. Three plants were chosen from each
location and all plants exhibited green and red (mature) stems
(Fig. S2, Supporting Information). Individual plants were collected whole and stored in zip-lock plastic bags using sterile
gloves for immediate processing on arrival at the laboratory.
Green and red fractions and roots were excised from each halophyte, obtaining three samples in triplicate for each location.
Excision areas were first hot cauterized using an incandescent
metal loop to avoid the loss of sap.
Approximately 40 g of each section of plant were selected
(fragments of 7–10 cm). Once the plant material had been excised and removed, it was sterilized and macerated. Plant material surfaces were washed with the following sequential steps:
initial incubation for 5 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 with sterile distilled water, followed by 5 min in sterile distilled water alone,
5 min in 2% bleach (NaClO) and finally 5 min in sterile distilled
water. The root samples were rinsed six times with sterile water
(5 min each step) in order to completely remove the soil attached
to their surfaces. After the last wash, the plant material was
dried using sterile paper towels. To disaggregate the plant tissues, 5–25 mL of PBS 1X were added to the plant material and the
mixture was macerated using a sterile mortar and pestle (MoraRuiz et al. 2015).

Separation of the microbial fraction from vegetal
debris, and microbial DNA extraction
Fifteen milliliters of macerated biomass were subjected to differential centrifugation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation, as previously reported (Mora-Ruiz et al. 2015). All layers
recovered from the centrifugation gradient were numbered according to their density and stored at −20◦ C. The layers with
higher density were used for DNA extraction, which was performed as previously reported (Mora-Ruiz et al. 2015).

Soil collection and microbial DNA extraction
For each plant, its respective rhizospheric soil was collected by
shaking the roots vigorously in order to separate the loosely
adhered soil. The soil tightly adhered to the roots was also
collected and the samples were immediately transferred to the

(OM), total nitrogen, carbonates (CO3 2− ), available phosphorus
and changeable potassium (K+ ), sodium (Na+ ) and magnesium
(Mg2+ ).

PCR amplification and 454-pyrosequencing
PCR amplification with the bacterial primers GM3 and S
(Table S1, Supporting Information) was performed as previously
described (Lane et al. 1986). A second PCR was performed using 5 µL of the product as template, in triplicates of 25 µL, using the primers GM3-PS and a variant of 907-PS (from position
8 to 907: V1–V4 regions of 16S rRNA; Table S1, Supporting Information) to tag and link the amplicon, with the same annealing temperature. The products were observed in 1% agarose
gel electrophoresis run in 1X TAE buffer (at 25 V for 50 min).
The band with a size of ∼960 bp was excised and eluted using the Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research, California, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The
NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Massachusetts, USA) and MassRuler Express Forward DNA Ladder Mix (Thermo Scientific) were used to measure the concentration of the barcoded amplicons. An equimolar mix of the amplicons was sent to Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, Korea) for sequencing using 454 GS-FLX+ Titanium technology. Trimmed sequences have
been deposited in the ENA sequence repository under the study
accession number SAMEA3928333–SAMEA3928356.

Sequence trimming, OTU grouping, phylogenetic
affiliation and OPU design
Sequence data were processed using Mothur (Schloss et al. 2009)
software to trim and remove chimeras. Low-quality and short
sequences were discarded (<300 nucleotides). Trimming was
performed with a window size of 25, and average quality score of
25, and no mismatches or ambiguities between primer pairs and
barcodes were allowed. Chimeras were removed using Chimera
Uchime (Mothur) and sequences were clustered in OTUs at 99%
using the UCLUST tool included in QIIME (Caporaso et al. 2010).
The longest read of each OTU was selected as representative
and was added to the non-redundant SILVA REF115 database
using the ARB software package (Ludwig et al. 2004). Sequences
were initially aligned with SINA (Pruesse, Peplies and Glöckner
2012) and inserted using the parsimony tool (ARB package) in
a default tree. Chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences were
discarded. The closest relative sequences of adequate quality
were selected and merged with the LTPs115 database (Yarza
et al. 2010). A phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the neighbor-joining algorithm and the Jukes–Cantor correction with the selected closest relative sequences and type strain
representatives. Finally, the OTU representatives were inserted
into the final reconstruction using the parsimony tool, and then
clustered in OPUs (França et al. 2015) based on the visual inspection of the final tree. An OPU is the smallest monophyletic group
of sequences containing OTU representatives together with the
closest reference sequence, including the sequence of a type
strain when possible.

Ecological indices and statistical analysis
Rarefaction curves and equitability-J index were calculated from
OPUs using PAST v 3.01 software (Hammer, Harper and Ryan
2001). Jost index (q = 1) was computed by a Monte Carlo resampling (1000 simulations) the OPU matrix to the minimum sequences. Non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis tests were performed
in order to compare ecological indices and soil physicochemical parameters in each location and internal fraction, as they
did not satisfy assumptions of normality and homogeneity of
variances. The multivariate community structure in relation
to sampling location, plant compartment and interindividual
variability of OPUs was statistically analyzed using non-metric
multidimensional scaling (NMDS; Kruskal and Wish 1978). The
goodness of the NMDS was evaluated according to a stress value
smaller than 0.263, which is considered acceptable for 18 samples (Sturrock and Rocha 2000). Fitted vectors were represented
as arrows pointing in the direction of the most rapid change in
the environmental variables (Dı́az-Gil et al. 2014; Oksanen 2016).
Additionally, a permutational multivariate analysis of variance
(Anderson 2001) was used to test the statistical significance of
the differences between bacterial communities and the environmental parameters, in order to determine their influence
on the variability in the microbial communities. Hierarchical
cluster analysis was performed using the Sørensen distance
(Sørensen 1948) and Ward’s linkage (Ward 1963). An indicator
species analysis (ISA) (De Cáceres and Legendre 2009) was used
to identify the indicator taxa responsible for the differences between groups identified with the cluster analyses. The correlation matrixes were obtained by comparing the diversity at the
phylum level in the endophytic and rhizospheric community
with their respective soil. Analyses were performed with the
packages vegan (Oksanen 2016) and indicspecies in R v 3.1.1.
(www.r-project.org).

RESULTS
Analysis of 454-pyrosequencing data
This study included plant biomass in triplicate and their respective rhizospheric soil collected in Campos and Alcúdia,
both located in Mallorca, Spain. A total of 97 872 sequences
were generated that, after trimming and removing short, bad or
chimera sequences, resulted in a dataset of 58 517 sequences
with a mean of 2438 ± 1825 per sample (Table S1, Supporting
Information). The clustering into OTUs at 99% rendered a total of 5393 with a mean of 225 ± 296 representatives that after
phylogenetic inference were grouped into a total of 657 OPUs
(78 ± 70; Table 1). From these, 249 OPUs were present in the
endosphere of the plants studied, and 408 were exclusive to
soils.

Soil sample collection and physicochemical parameters

Soil characterization

Six soil samples were collected from locations Campos and
Alcúdia where the sampled plants were growing. Physicochemical parameters were analyzed at the Conselleria d’Agricultura,
Medi Ambient i Territori (Govern de les Illes Balears, Mallorca, Spain). The analyzed physicochemical parameters were
pH, electrical conductivity (at 25◦ C), oxidizable organic matter

Soil physicochemical parameters indicated that the pH was alkaline and nearly the same in both locations (8.28 ± 0.39 and
8.29 ± 0.18; P > 0.05). In addition, carbonates (%), exchangeable Na+ and Mg2+ (%) displayed similar values (P > 0.05) in
both places. However, the values of salinity (%), exchangeable
K+ , oxidizable OM (%), total N (%) and available P (%) (Figs 1 and

2) showed differences depending on the location, with salinity
and K+ being higher in C (P < 0.05), whereas an inverse pattern
(P < 0.05) was observed for the remaining measured parameters
(Figs 1 and 2).

Analysis of the total bacterial endophytic
community structures
The majority of sequences in the endosphere represented 249
OPUs affiliated with Proteobacteria (86.7% of the total sequences
integrated in 151 OPUs). The major proteobacterial taxa affiliated
with the classes Alphaproteobacteria (48 OPUs = 7.7% sequences)
and Gammaproteobacteria (74 OPUs = 76.3% sequences). Firmicutes
(35 OPUs = 8.8% sequences) and Bacteroidetes (28 OPUs = 1.8% sequences) followed Proteobacteria in abundance. Minor taxa were
detected in 11 additional phyla (35 OPUs = 2.6% sequences;
Table 2).
The top most abundant OPUs affiliated with Proteobacteria.
OPUs 1 (Rudaea cellulosilytica), 6 (Psychrobacter spp.), 12 (Chromohalobacter canadensis), 13 (Halomonas spp.) and 109 (Bradyrhizobium spp.) were present in all fractions of all plants (Fig. 3;
Table 2), and in high sequence numbers. However, a high number of OPUs were exclusively detected in single compartments
(green = 10, red = 26 and root = 79), all of which, except OPU

163 (Bhargavaea spp. Fig. 3; Table 2), were detected in very low
abundances of less than 0.48%. The results were similar for
the beta-diversity analyses where the Campos compartments
did not show differences (F-statistic = 1.034, P = 0.413) and the
Alcúdia compartments showed results very close to the significance level α = 0.05 (F-statistic = 1.78, P = 0.049; Table S2, Supporting Information). In the same way, richness estimations (P >
0.05; q = 0) and rarefaction curves (Table 1 and Fig. S3, Supporting Information) did not exhibit differences by compartment.
However, the Jost q = 1 and equitability-J indices were different between compartments, and were always lower in the red
fraction (Fig. 3). On the other hand, when comparing the betadiversity between both locations the differences were significant
(F-statistic = 1.91, P < 0.001; Table S2, Supporting Information)
and similar to the richness estimations (P < 0.05).
Regarding the community structures in relation to the soil
physicochemical properties, salinity and OM were the parameters that better correlated with the endophytic differences between locations (Fig. 1). However, only OM showed a significant
value (P < 0.05) for the effect of discriminating the communities by location. Additionally, it was notable that the correlation
analyses (data not shown) indicated that none of the soil chemical parameters measured were good predictors of the bacterial
diversity indices.

Description of the bacterial communities by plant
compartment and location
The most abundant OPUs 1 (R. cellulosilytica), 6 (Psychrobacter
sp.), 12 (C. canadensis), 13 (Halomonas spp.) and 109 (Bradyrhizobium sp.) were present in all fractions (Table 2). Psychrobacter
sp. (OPU 6; up to 37.5%) was especially abundant in red and
R. cellulosilytica (OPU 1; up to 12.1%) was remarkably abundant
in green and root (Fig. 3). In addition, there were compartmentexclusive OPUs, especially noticeable in the root fraction dominated principally by Enterobacter species, and uncultured Sodalis sp. in red. The 10 OPUs exclusive to green were homogeneously distributed between Bacteroidetes (Hymenobacter sp.) and
Actinobacteria (Corynebacterium sp.) (Table 2).
The differences between locations were marked by 45 exclusive OPUs in Alcúdia and 120 in Campos. The latter showed
the highest richness values, which were principally observed
in the root compartments (Table 1). In general, the abundances of the exclusive OPUs were low and ranged between
0.01% and 1.70%, with the exception of Enterobacter amnigenus
(OPU 57) that accounted for 8.67% of the total sequences in
Alcúdia roots (Fig. 3). In the Campos location, the most common families were Moraxellaceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae, Sphingomonadaceae and Flavobacteriaceae, whereas in Alcúdia they were Enterobacteriaceae and Planococcaceae. Among these, according to
the ISA, there were 27 indicator species for Campos and 3 for
Alcúdia (P < 0.05; Table S3, Supporting Information). Additionally, all the representatives of Epsilonproteobacteria (OPUs 101 and
102), Tenericutes (OPUs 180 and 181) and Gemmatimonadetes (OPU
229) were only detected in Alcúdia, with all Planctomycetes (OPUs
224 and 225), Armatimonadetes (OPU 244) and Chloroflexi (OPU 249)
only in Campos.

Rhizospheric soil microbial community structures
Alcúdia samples exhibited higher richness than those in Campos, contrary to that observed for the endophytic community (Table 1), and both locations showed different community

structures (Fig. S4 and Table S2, Supporting Information). Rhizospheric soils from Alcúdia and Campos shared 17 (4.8 ± 2.5% of
the total sequences) and 39 (20.2 ± 3.3% of the total sequences)
OPUs with the respective endospheres. On the other hand, these
shared OPUs represented approximately 8.9 ± 5.0% and 53.5 ±
17.3% in Campos of the sequences belonging to the endophytic
communities (Fig. 4). No special abundance of the shared OPUs
was detected in any specific fraction of the plant. Halomonas sp.
and Pseudomonas sp. (OPUs 13 and 16) were the most important
OPUs shared between rhizospheric soil and endosphere in both
locations.
Despite the fact that the rhizospheric communities were distinct in both locations, they were both principally represented

on 18 February 2018

by Proteobacteria (52.7% of the total sequences for Alcúdia, and
33.9% for Campos), with Gammaproteobacteria being the most
abundant class. Another 21 phyla were additionally detected
but, of these, only Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes and Saccharibacteria exhibited abundances higher than 2% in Alcúdia or Campos
(Table 2).
The most abundant OPUs in Alcúdia soil were Rhodovibrio salinarum (OPU 145; representing up to 3%–18% of the sequences),
Halomonas sp. (OPU 13), uncultured Ruminococcaceae sp. (OPU
190), Acidobacteria Subgroup 6 sp. (OPU 254), Draconibacteriaceae
sp. (OPU 408) and uncultured Azospira sp. (OPU 432) (these latter five clades together represented between 10% and 16% of

the total sequences; Table 2). Only the first OPUs co-occurred in
their respective endophytic fraction, and Halomonas sp. (OPU 13)
occurred in all fractions.
On the other hand, Campos soils were characterized by high
abundances of OM1 clade sp. (OPU 278; between 11% and 48%
of the total sequences), C. canadensis (OPU 12), E. amnigenus
(OPU 57), Rh. salinarum (OPU 145; uncultured Ruminococcaceae sp.
(OPU 190) and ABS-19 (OPU 251) (these latter five clades together
represented between 10% and 19% of the total sequences). From
these, only C. canadensis and Rh. salinarum co-occurred in some of
their respective endophytic fractions (Table 2; Fig. 3). In addition,
R. cellulosilytica also co-occurred but with abundances lower than
1.4%, whereas C. canadensis occurred in all fractions from plants
and soil, which was similar to Halomonas sp. for the Alcúdia
location.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first report where compartmentalization of endophytic bacterial communities from the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of halophytes has been analyzed at
a microscale and mesoscale. OPUs could be identified as taxa
at the species and genus levels because the sequences were of
higher quality (lengths of over 800 bp) compared to other similar
studies (Gottel et al. 2011; Bodenhausen, Horton and Bergelson
2013), and also because the OPU approach by means of phylogenetic inferences produced more accurate identifications (92.8%
of the OPUs could be affiliated at the genus level; Vidal et al.
2015).
We are aware that the sample number may be low, but our
results appear consistent with our previous studies (Mora-Ruiz
et al. 2015), where differences in endosphere composition were
dependent on the location, but the major key players were
common in all plants. Most of the principal elements in the
endosphere were moderate halophiles. The presence of Chromohalobacter canadensis was previously reported in Arthrocnemum macrostachyum and the other halophyte Allenrolfea vaginata
(Mora-Ruiz et al. 2015).

The differences detected between the locations may respond
to the combination of the soil physicochemical properties and
microbial composition, and the host genotype (Bulgarelli et al.
2012). However, relevant host genotype differences were discarded as the plants were only 60 km apart. In this regard, the
soils studied here exhibited considerable physicochemical differences that could condition their bacterial diversity (Fierer and
Jackson 2006), despite the fact that pH was alkaline and similar
to other reported values (Pereira, Vicentini and Ottoboni 2014;
Gao et al. 2015). However, the soil in Campos exhibited 10-fold
higher salinity (considered to be a strongly saline soil ≥ 2%; U.S.
Regional Salinity Laboratory Staff 1947) and differences in other
parameters depending on the location were observed. These
physicochemical parameters might directly influence the microbial composition of soils (Gao et al. 2015), and the rhizospheric
soil of Alcúdia (more mesophilic environment and organic rich)
showed nearly 3-fold more OPUs than Campos. In addition, a
direct correlation was detected between CO3 2− and salinity concentrations with the presence of Bacteroidetes, Deltaproteobacteria and Chlorobi (higher in Alcúdia), and K+ concentrations with
Actinobacteria (higher in Campos). K+ has been considered as one
of the principal chemical parameters influencing distinct abundances of phyla in soil bacterial communities (Pereira, Vicentini
and Ottoboni 2014). However, there may be other environmental
traits (e.g. aeration, pore size, temperature and water) not registered in this study that could control microbial diversity patterns
(Nemergut et al. 2011; Bokulich et al. 2014).
Accordingly, the soils from the two locations were different in
their taxa compositions. For both locations, only Rhodovibrio salinarum and uncultured Ruminococcaceae sp. were part of the most
abundant OPUs in Campos and Alcúdia. The former OPU, already
reported in hypersaline sediments (Mack et al. 1993), was shared
by both soils in similar quantities. However, it was remarkable
that C. canadensis remained undetectable in the Alcúdia soils,
this OPU being one of the most abundant in endosphere. In the
same way, Bradyrhizobium sp. was abundant in the endosphere
from the two locations and not detected in their corresponding
soils, contrary to previously reported in Populus deltoides, where
it was principally detected in rhizosphere (Gottel et al. 2011).

The size of the ellipses represents their total number of OPUs. The percentages of abundances of the most relevant OPUs in each group of samples (rhizospheric soil
and endosphere) and shared OPUs are given below.

The soil salinity also influences the halophytes colonizing
them. As other halophytes, A. macrostachyum accumulates distinct ion concentrations in its vacuoles in amounts directly correlated with the increase of external (soil) salt concentrations
due to increased uptake by osmoregulation (Redondo-Gómez
et al. 2010). As Campos soil was more saline than Alcúdia soil,
the plants may have had different saline contents in their endospheres, which would influence the composition of each endosphere. There were some major ubiquitous organisms in the
endosphere, and some were also detected in the soils of both
locations, such as Halomonas sp., or only in the Campos soils.
Their presence in the endosphere could originate after root colonization due to chemotaxis (Bulgarelli et al. 2013) from the
soil communities (Wulff, van Vuurde and Hockenhull 2003; Chi
et al. 2005), followed by migration to the aerial parts. However,
some relevant taxa were undetectable in Alcúdia soils, although
they probably formed part of the seed bank or rare biosphere
of these soils (Pedro-Aliós 2006), and would gain preponderance
in a favorable endophytic environment. These were not isolated

cases, as other organisms (not observed as ubiquitous), such
as Marinomonas sp. (also endophytes of marine plants; Espinosa
et al. 2010) or Sphingomonas sp., were not detected in the soils.
An alternative origin could also be related to aerosol transmission through the aerial parts (Fahlgren et al. 2010), or by vertical
transmission (bacteria already occurring in the seeds; Truyens
et al. 2015). However, the fact that between 9% (for Alcúdia) and
53% (for Campos) of the total endospheric taxonomic composition was shared with their corresponding rhizospheric soil
communities led us to believe that root colonization may be
the major contributor to the endosphere composition (Bulgarelli
et al. 2013). The lower salinity of the Alcúdia soils may explain
the low abundances of the ubiquitous and relevant endophytic,
halophilic bacteria, such as C. canadensis that would gain preponderance once colonizing the plant with higher saline levels
in its endosphere.
A clear diversity gradient was observed between the three
compartments in each plant, being higher in the rhizosphere
(as already reported for Arabidopsis thaliana; Bodenhausen,

Mora-Ruiz et al.

Horton and Bergelson 2013) and decreasing towards the more
mature aerial parts, with the latter having less equitability. In
general, the diversity values detected were very similar to previous studies of leaves (Emiliani et al. 2014; Jin et al. 2014). No clear
trend could be detected in the distinct occurrence of specific
OPUs in the different compartments, some of which (generally a
minority) seemed to be specifically associated with one fraction
of the plant. Others, like most of the representatives of the Enterobacteriaceae (especially Enterobacter amnigenus), were notably
abundant in the root’s endosphere, some of which have been reported as having plant growth-promoting effects principally associated with roots (Whipps 2001). Additionally, two of the most
important OPUs, Psychrobacter sp. and Rudaea cellulosilytica, had
notable abundance variations in the red fractions, being higher
and lower (respectively) in these more mature parts of the plant
in comparison with other areas of the endosphere. The reduction of diversity from the roots towards the more mature parts
of the plant, apart from reinforcing a rhizospheric origin of the
endogenous microbiota, may respond to factors such as passive mobility following water fluxes (Taghavi et al. 2010); specific selection due to plant–microbe interaction, such as chemotaxis (Bulgarelli et al. 2013) or plant defensive systems (Jones and
Dangl 2006); and specialization in niche colonization (Bulgarelli
et al. 2013).
In summary, the results presented here indicated that the endosphere of the halophyte A. macrostachyum may be strongly influenced by the microbial composition of the soils where this
plant grows, and the soils themselves by their environmental
physicochemical parameters. In this regard, the higher saline
conditions of the Campos soil led to reduced taxa richness in
accordance with what occurs in extreme saline environments
(Hollister et al. 2010). The influence of the soil on plant microbial colonization was supported by its sharing of taxa with the
plant compartments, and with reduction of diversity from the
roots towards the mature aerial parts. On the other hand, there
were several ubiquitous major microbial components, moderately halophilic in their metabolism, which seemed to be plant
related and not always detectable in the rhizospheric soils. Their
presence may indicate a probable relevant role in the plant–
microbe interaction, and the absence of detection in some soil
samples could point to other alternative origins (e.g. presence
in plant seeds prior to germination). Finally, the endophytic
lifestyle of some taxa is reported here for the first time, such as
the known cellulose-degrading microorganism R. cellulosilytica,
which although present in some soils has not yet been reported
as part of the endomicrobiota of plants (Weon et al. 2009). The
study provides an insight into understanding the possible mechanisms of dispersion and colonization in different plant lifecycle
stages (seeds, seedlings and adults) and the endosphere microbial community dynamics associated with halophytes.

In this study, phenol wastewater treatment systems treated with different concentrations of singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) (0–3.5 g/L) were exposed to phenol and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
shock loadings to investigate the long-term impacts of SWCNTs on microbial communities. Phenol
removal remained high efficiency (>98%) in SWCNTs-treated groups but decreased in non-treated group
(85.1 ± 1.9%) when exposed to high concentration of phenol (500 mg/L). However, secondary dosing of
SWCNTs in SWCNTs-treated groups would decrease the phenol removal efficiency. Illumina MiSeq
sequencing revealed that the diversity, richness and structure of microbial communities were shifted
under phenol shock loading, especially under high phenol concentration, but not under CNTs shock loading. In response to phenol and CNTs shock loadings, Rudaea, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Acinetobacter,
Methylocystis and Thauera became dominant genera, which should be involved in phenol removal.
These results suggested that a proper amount of SWCNTs might have positive effects on phenol wastewater treatment systems.

1. Introduction
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), e.g. single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), have
been incorporated into diverse commercial products due to their
unique chemical, physical and electrical properties (De Volder
et al., 2013). The extensive manufacture and utilization of CNTs
may lead to their release and accumulation in environment (soil,
water, air and sediment), which raises a serious concern about
their potential impacts on environmental and human health

(Köhler et al., 2008; Petersen et al., 2011). Wastewater treatment
plants are generally used to clean the sewage from home and businesses before safely released into environment, and the microbial
communities of activated sludge from the biological process play
a critical role in the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants
(Hu et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2015a; Shu et al., 2015). Once the
CNTs-containing sewage enters into wastewater treatment plants,
which is almost inevitable, whether the CNTs would affect the
microbial communities responsible for pollutants removal is
worthy of attention (Petersen et al., 2011).
The impacts of CNTs on microbial communities of activated
sludge are gradually being studied in recent years, but the roles
of CNTs are still controversial. Hai et al. (2014) found that MWCNTs

210

had adverse effects on wastewater nutrient removal, and they
would also inhibited the activities of key enzymes, such as ammonia monooxygenase, nitrite oxidoreductase, exopolyphosphatase
and polyphosphate kinase. On the contrary, Zheng et al. (2014)
found that neither the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus nor
the activities of key enzymes were significantly affected by CNTs
(including SWCNTs and MWCNTs). Furthermore, the toxicity of
CNTs on microbial communities is suggested to be related with
the concentration, physical properties (length and diameter) and
types of functionalization (carboxylic and hydroxylic) (Goyal
et al., 2010; Luongo and Zhang, 2010; Oleszczuk et al., 2011;
Parise et al., 2014; Kerfahi et al., 2015). The floc architecture and
original microbial community structure of activated sludge also
have a profoundly influence on the behaviors and effects of CNTs
(Petersen et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2015b). Thus, it is necessary to
investigate the impacts of CNTs on activated sludge of wastewater
treatment systems from different perspectives, which may provide
a helpful guide for the safe use and disposal of nanomaterials.
Recently, with the development of high throughput metagenomic
technologies, it enables us to analyze the microbial community
in a more comprehensive and informative way (Roh et al., 2010;
Zhou et al., 2015), which can contribute to the research on ecological effects of CNTs.
In previous study, five groups of sequencing batch reactors
(SBRs) dosing with 0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 g/L SWCNTs, respectively,
were constructed for the treatment of phenol wastewater
(Qu et al., 2015). The results showed that SWCNTs exerted protective effects on sludge microbes, but they would also alter the structure and diversity of microbial community. Herein, the SBRs
continued to run under phenol and CNTs shock loading conditions,
and the long-term impacts of SWCNTs on the microbial communities of phenol wastewater treatment systems were assessed with
the aid of Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology. The present
study should provide insights into the understanding of SWCNTs
nanotechnology.
2. Methods
2.1. Chemicals and activated sludge
SWCNTs (>95%) were purchased from Shenzhen Nanotech Port
Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China), and the characteristics of the SWCNTs
have been described previously (Shen et al., 2013; Qu et al., 2015).
All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Activated sludge was
collected from Chunliu River Wastewater Treatment Plant (Dalian,
China).

added into G4 to investigate the effects of CNTs shock loading on
the performances of wastewater treatment systems and microbial
communities. The SBRs were operated with the synthetic wastewater containing 500 mg/L phenol for another 20 days, and samples
were taken at Day 0, 1 and 20 (designated as Day C0, C1 and C20)
for sequencing analysis. During the operation process, the concentrations of phenol in influent and effluent were monitored daily,
and the concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS),
the sludge volume after 0.5 h of settling (SV30) and the pH of effluent were measured at certain days.
2.3. Analytical methods
To determine the concentrations of phenol, the effluent samples
were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min to remove suspended
sludge, and the supernatants were analyze using a JASCO V-560
UV–vis spectrophotometer (Japan). MLSS and SV30 were measured
using the standard methods, and the pH of effluents was determined by a Mettler-Toledo S30 pH meter (Switzerland).
2.4. DNA extraction, PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing
The genomic DNA was extracted from the activated sludge samples using the protocol reported by Purkhold et al. (2000), and the
V4 region of 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the primer set
515F (50 -GTG CCA GCM GCC GCG GTA A-30 ) and 806R (50 -GGA
CTA CHV GGG TWT CTA AT-30 ). PCR amplification was carried
out based on the methods described previously (Qu et al., 2015;
Shi et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015), and the resulting PCR amplicons were used for sequencing on Illumina MiSeq platform at the
Institute for Environmental Genomics, University of Oklahoma.
2.5. Data analysis
After sequencing, the data processing was conducted as
described previously (Ma et al., 2015a; Qu et al., 2015; Zhang
et al., 2015). Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were generated
using CD-HIT method, and the taxonomic assignment of OTUs
were performed by RDP classifier. The Shannon diversity index
(H), Pielou’s evenness index (J), species richness estimator of Chao1

2.2. Experimental setup
Five groups of SBRs were constructed previously (Qu et al.,
2015), and each group was performed in triplicate under identical
conditions (Fig. S1). The synthetic wastewater consisted of 20 mg/L
KH2PO4, 90 mg/L NH4Cl, 10 mg/L NaCl, 12.5 mg/L MgSO47H2O,
12 mg/L CaCl2, 10 mg/L FeSO47H2O, 785 mg/L glucose and
200–500 mg/L phenol. SWCNTs were added directly to each SBR
at the beginning of operation with different concentrations (g/L):
0 (G1), 0.5 (G2), 1.5 (G3), 2.5 (G4) and 3.5 (G5). No additional
SWCNTs were supplemented during the operation unless otherwise indicated. Each cycle of SBR was operated for 24 h, including
2 h filling, 18 h reacting, 2 h settling, and 2 h decanting. To simulate phenol shock loading, the SBRs were operated for 40 days with
the concentrations of phenol in influent increasing from 200 mg/L
(0–20 days) to 500 mg/L (20–40 days). Samples were collected at
Day 0, 20 and 40 for Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis. Afterwards (41st day after phenol shock), extra SWCNTs (2.5 g/L) was

loading conditions. SBRs were treated with different concentrations of SWCNTs
(g/L): 0 (G1), 0.5 (G2), 1.5 (G3), 2.5 (G4) and 3.5 (G5). Each group was performed in
triplicate. For phenol shock loading, the concentrations of phenol in influent was
increased from 200 mg/L (0–20 days) to 500 mg/L (20–40 days). For CNTs shock
loading, 2.5 g/L SWCNTs was additionally added into G4 and the concentrations of
phenol in influent were maintained at 500 mg/L. C0, C1 and C20 represent the
sampling time of Day 0, Day 1 and Day 20, respectively, under CNTs shock loading
conditions.

and rarefaction curves were generated using Mothur program. The
statistics analyses, including detrended correspondence analysis
(DCA), multiple-response permutation procedure (MRPP), permutational multivariate analysis of variance (Adonis), analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and Pearson correlation test, were performed
using R environment (version 3.2.1; http://www.r-project.org/).
Heat map was generated using HemI (Heatmap Illustrator, version
1.0) (Deng et al., 2014).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phenol removal performance of SBRs systems
The 15 SBRs were operated for more than two months, and the
MLSS, SV30 and effluent pH had no significant changes (Fig. S2),
indicating the systems were stable during the operation. Fig. 1
depicts the long-term phenol removal performances of the SBRs.
When phenol concentration was around 200 mg/L, each of the
SBRs exhibited excellent phenol removal efficiencies (>98%), which
was in accordance with the previous study (Qu et al., 2015). When
phenol concentration increased to 500 mg/L, the SBRs treated with
different concentrations of SWCNTs maintained high efficiencies of
phenol removal (>98%), while the phenol removal efficiency of G1
declined from 98.8% to 84.0% over the long-term operation. These
results suggested the positive influences of SWCNTs on phenol
wastewater treatment systems under phenol shock loading conditions over the long-term operation.
To further investigate the effects of CNTs shock loading on
wastewater treatment efficiency of SBRs, G4 was chosen and inoculated with an additional dose of 2.5 g/L SWCNTs. During the first
10 days of operation, the phenol removal efficiencies had no significant changes and remained around 99%. However, after 20 days of
exposure, the phenol removal efficiencies significantly decreased
(<85%). The results indicated that secondary high dosing of CNTs
would negatively affect reactor performance.
Although SWCNTs could be used as the efficient absorbents for
the removal of aromatics, SWCNTs could not improve the absorption of phenol when added into the activated sludge since there
were no differences among the autoclaved sludge systems with
or without SWCNTs (Qu et al., 2015). Thus, the indigenous bacteria
should play the most significant roles in the removal of phenol.

estimator was calculated using Mothur program. It was found that
the microbial richness (OTUs and Chao1) slightly increased from
Day 0 to Day 20, except G1, but then significantly decreased at
Day 40 (ANOVA, P < 0.05) (Table 1). Likewise, both Shannon (H)
and evenness (J) indices showed the similar variation as the richness indices (Table 1). These results indicated that high concentrations of phenol would reduce the a-diversity of microbial
community due to the toxicity effects of phenol on microorganism.
When facing CNTs shock loading, the microbial richness and diversity had no significant changes upon either short-term (1 day) or
long-term (20 days) exposure (P > 0.10) (Table 1).
To assess the overall variation of microbial communities in
response to phenol and CNTs shock loading, DCA analysis was
performed. As shown in Fig. 2, the communities underwent a clear

3.2. Shifts in microbial communities of SBRs
To investigate the microbial community shifts in response to
phenol and CNTs shock loading, Illumina MiSeq sequencing
analysis was performed. After removing low-quality reads, at least
35,700 effective sequences were obtained and normalized for each
sample. The sequences were then grouped into OTUs at a
clustering threshold of 0.97 using CD-HIT method, and the Chao1

Day 1 and Day 20, respectively, under CNTs shock loading conditions.

shift from Day 0 to Day 40 with the concentrations of phenol in
influent increasing from 200 to 500 mg/L. The results of three
dissimilarity tests, i.e. Adonis, ANOSIM and MRPP, showed that
the community structures at Day 0, 20 and 40 were significantly
different from each other (P < 0.05) (Table S1). However, the CNTs
shock loading had no significant effects on microbial communities
as observed from DCA plots and dissimilarity tests (P > 0.10) (Fig. 2
and Table S1).
3.3. Microbial community structure analysis
To identify taxonomic diversity of microbial communities from
these 15 SBRs, RDP identifier was employed to assign the sequence
tags to different taxonomic levels (from phylum to genus) at 50%
threshold. At the phylum level, a total of 30 phyla were detected
and the majority belonged to 10 phyla, which covered over 97%
of the effective sequence tags. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all samples, accounting for 58.1–81.4% of total
sequences (Fig. 3a). Other dominant phyla included Bacteroidetes
(5.3–15.7%),
Acidobacteria
(3.1–9.7%)
and
Planctomycetes
(1.9–6.7%). Notably, the abundances of Proteobacteria in G1 were
significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those in other four groups

under phenol shock loading conditions (at Day 20 and Day 40).
While under CNTs shock loading conditions, the abundances of
Proteobacteria had almost no changes after 1 day of operation
(P > 0.10) but significantly decreased after 20 days (P < 0.05)
(Fig. 3a). Besides, the abundances of Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes in G1 were seemed to be lower than those in SWCNTstreated groups.
Within Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria (11.0–36.8%),
Alphaproteobacteria
(13.2–36.1%)
and
Bataproteobacteria
(9.8–27.7%) were more abundant in all samples (Fig. 3b). The abundances of Gammaproteobacteria showed similar patterns as
Proteobacteria under phenol and CNTs shock loading conditions,
which decreased after long-term exposure to SWCNTs (Fig. 3b).
These results indicated that SWCNTs might have adverse effects
on Proteobacteria under long-term exposure, especially for
Gammaproteobacteria. On the contrary, previous study by Hai
et al. (2014) indicated that MWCNTs would increase the abundances of Proteobacteria in activated sludge, especially for
Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria.
Among the 527 assigned genera, the 10 most abundant genera in
each treatment at different sampling time were used for heat map
analysis, and a total of 17 genera were selected for comparison

(Fig. S3). Among the dominant genera, Zoogloea and Haliscomenobacter could be related to sludge settling properties, while
Rudaea, Burkholderia, Acinetobacter, Methylocystis, Thauera and
Sphingomonas could play important roles in phenol degradation.
Zoogloea and Haliscomenobacter were widely spread in activated
sludge, which have been regarded as floc-forming and filamentous
bacteria, respectively (Guo and Zhang, 2012; Zhao et al., 2013).
Zoogloea played a key role in the flocculation of activated sludge,
while Haliscomenobacter could be related to sludge bulking and
foaming. On Day 0, the relative abundances of Zoogloea in G2-G4
were higher than that in G1 (Fig. 4), suggesting that SWCNTs might
have a positive effect on sludge settling ability, which was in accordance with the results of SV30 measurement (Fig. S2). Under phenol shock loading conditions, the abundances of Zoogloea in
SWCNTs-treated groups decreased firstly and then increased when
phenol concentration was raised, while the abundances of Haliscomenobacter increased in each treatment. Under CNTs shock loading conditions, the long-term exposure would significantly
decrease the abundance of Haliscomenobacter. The results indicated
that SWCNTs might significantly affect the settling ability of activated sludge (Yin et al., 2009; Hai et al., 2014; Qu et al., 2015).
Rudaea was detected in all treatments with considerably high
abundance (5.6–22.0%) (Fig. 4). The abundance of Rudaea
decreased when the concentration of phenol was 500 mg/L, but it
would be improved after the long-term operation under CNTs
shock loading conditions. Previous studies have indicated that
genus Rudaea was detected in soil and activated sludge contaminated with aromatic compounds, such as biphenyl, naphthalene
and phenol (Uhlik et al., 2012; Qu et al., 2015). Thus, Rudaea could
have a considerable potential in bioremediation of aromatic pollutants (such as phenol).
Burkholderia and Acinetobacter showed high versatility in
genetic diversity and metabolic capacity, which enabled them to
degrade various natural and xenobiotic pollutants, such as toluene,
phenols and polychlorobiphenyls (Mahenthiralingam et al., 2005;
Al-Khalid and El-Naas, 2012). The relative abundance of Burkholderia decreased during the long-term operation, while the relative
abundance of Acinetobacter had a slight increase under low concentration of phenol (200 mg/L), but then decreased after long-term
exposure to either high phenol concentration or CNTs shock loading (Fig. 4).
Methylocystis, Thauera and Sphingomonas all increased in relative abundances as the phenol concentration increased, especially
in SWCNTs-treated groups when phenol concentration was raised
to 500 mg/L (Fig. 4). However, the CNTs shock loading would also
decrease the abundances of Thauera and Sphingomonas. Previous
studies have shown that Methylocystis could be used for the degradation of chlorinated aromatic compounds (e.g. chlorobenzene)
and trichloroethylene (McDonald et al., 1997; Jechorek et al.,
2003), while Thauera was an important population in wastewater
treatment plants (Liu et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2015a), which had a
versatile capacity to degrade a wide spectrum of aromatic compounds, such as phenol, indole and toluene (Shinoda et al., 2004;
Mao et al., 2010). Sphingomonas possessed extraordinary metabolic
versatility, which could be used to degrade a wide range of recalcitrant natural and anthropogenic compounds, such as biphenyl(s),
naphthalene(s), phenols and pesticides (Stolz, 2009). Therefore,
Methylocystis, Thauera and Sphingomonas could be more responsible for the efficient removal of phenol during the operation.

phenol wastewater treatment systems. The effects of SWCNTs on
microbial community could be observed in three aspects. Firstly,
SWCNTs could change the richness and diversity of microbial community. It was noticed that the microbial richness (OTU and Chao1)
and diversity (Shannon and evenness) of SWCNTs-treated groups
(G2-G5) were a little higher than those of non-treated group (G1)
at Day 20 and Day 40 (Table 1), suggesting that SWCNTs might
have protective effects against phenol. Previous studies indicated
that SWCNTs could induce the microbial community to produce
more extracellular polymeric substance, which might protect the
microbes from the toxicity of phenol (Yin et al., 2009; Qu et al.,
2015), thus leading to the high level of richness and diversity in
SWCNTs-treated groups.
Secondly, SWCNTs could alter the composition and structure of
microbial community. DCA plots showed that the communities of
G1 clustered separately from other groups treated with different
concentrations of SWCNTs (Fig. 2), which was further confirmed
by dissimilarity tests (Table S1), suggesting the addition of
SWCNTs would affect the assembly of microbial communities. In
previous studies, although CNTs (SWNCTs and MWCNTs) might
have positive or adverse effects on wastewater treatment efficiency, they could alter the diversity and structure of microbial
communities in activated sludge (Goyal et al., 2010; Hai et al.,
2014; Ma et al., 2015b; Qu et al., 2015).
Thirdly, SWCNTs could affect the taxa and function of microbial
community. To discern the impact of SWCNTs on microbial community composition, Pearson correlation between the abundance
of different taxa and the concentration of SWCNTs was examined.
The results indicated that more taxa at the class, family and genus
level showed positive relationships rather than negative, especially
after the long-term exposure to SWCNTs (Table S2). Among the
dominant genera, Acinetobacter, Methylocystis, Thauera and Sphingomonas were reported to be capable of degrading various xenobiotic pollutants (Al-Khalid and El-Naas, 2012; Jechorek et al., 2003;
Mao et al., 2010; Stolz, 2009). Thus, the higher abundances of these
genera in SWCNTs-treated groups than the non-treated group
might contribute to the better efficiency of phenol removal.
Although the diversity and structure of microbial community had
no significant changes under CNTs shock loading condition, the
dominant genera Acinetobacter, Thauera and Sphingomonas
decreased notably after the long-term exposure, which might
cause the fluctuations in phenol removal.

In previous studies, CNTs, in most cases, exhibited adverse or no
significant effects on microbial communities (Hai et al., 2014;
Zheng et al., 2014; Kerfahi et al., 2015). In contrast, the present
study suggested that SWCNTs could have positive influences on

4. Conclusions
The long-term impacts of SWCNTs on microbial communities of
wastewater treatment systems were determined. SWCNTs might
have positive effects on phenol removal, but secondary high dosing
of SWCNTs would also have adverse effects on systems in longterm operation. Phenol shock loading, rather than CNTs shock
loading, would significantly affect the diversity, richness and structure of microbial communities. The dominant genera Rudaea,
Burkholderia, Acinetobacter, Methylocystis, Thauera and Sphingomonas should be more responsible for the high efficiency of phenol removal. This study should provide important information for
comprehensive analysis of the environmental effects of CNTs.

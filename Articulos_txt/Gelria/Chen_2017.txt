This study investigated the biological hydrolysis performance at 35 °C (BH35), 42 °C (BH42), and 55 °C (BH55)
and the eﬀect of temperatures on microbial communities of the hydrolyzed sludge. The results showed that the
suspended solid reduction, volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, and biogas production increased with the BH
temperatures. VFAs produced in the sludge BH included acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid,
and isovaleric acid with the fractions of acetic acid increased with BH temperatures. The Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis showed that the microbial taxonomic structures of the BH systems varied with BH temperatures. It was found that Acidaminobacter at 35 °C, Proteiniphilum and Lutispor at 42 °C, and Gelria at 55 °C were the
main protein fermenting bacteria genera, while the carbohydrate fermenting bacteria might belong to the genera
of Macellibacteroides and Paludibacter at 35 °C, Fronticella at 42 °C, and Tepidimicrobium at 55 °C.

1. Introduction
Anaerobic digestion (AD) of activated sludge has gained increasing
interests due to its essential role in reducing carbon footprints of wastewater treatment plants via energy recovery and waste reduction.
Biological hydrolysis/acidiﬁcation (BH) is a widely used pre-treatment
process to increase the methanogenic degradation of complex organic
compounds for methane production (Ding et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2011;

Ucisik and Henze, 2008; Wang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015a). Temperature is one of the key BH process parameters that can exert a
profound impact on the hydrolysis performance (Chu et al., 2008;
Duarte et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2013). Although the eﬀect of BH conditions on the biomass hydrolysis performance have been assessed by a
number of studies (Chu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2009), knowledge of
microbial communities structures in sludge BH systems is far from
adequate for understanding sludge BH mechanisms.

was assessed by examining the change in the sludge TSS and VSS
contents according to the Standard Methods (APHA-AWWA-WEF,
2005). The VFA compositions were measured using an Agilent 5890 gas
chromatography (GC) (Agilent Technologies, US) with an Agilent J & W
GC column (DB-FFAP 30 m × 0.25 mm) and a ﬂame ionization detector (FID). The injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C and
nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. The oven temperature was increased from 80 °C to 120 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min and held at 120 °C
for 4 min, and then increased from 120 °C to 220 °C at a rate of 6.1 °C/
min and held at 220 °C for 5 min. Volatile fatty acid mix standards
(Sigma-Aldrich, Canada) including acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, valeric, 4-methylvaleric (isocaproic), hexanoic (caproic), and heptanoic acids were used for the peak identiﬁcation and
standard curve determination.

The anaerobic conversion of organics into methane gas involves the
hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis steps (Lee
et al., 2014). Hydrolysis and acidogenesis bacteria, or the so-called
primary fermenters, catalyze the extracellular hydrolytic degradation of
polymers into oligo- or monomers and intracellular conversion of sugars, amino acids, fatty acids and other monomers into fatty acids,
lactate, alcohols, etc. Acetogenesis bacteria, or the secondary fermenters, degrade products of the primary fermentation into acetate, H2, and
CO2. The methanogenesis converts acetogenesis products into methane
gas via two main pathways: acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic CH4
production (Da Silva et al., 2015). The complete conversion of complex
organics to methane relies on syntrophic interactions of primary fermenters, secondary fermenters, and methanogens because mutual metabolic dependencies between diﬀerent groups of anaerobic microorganisms eliminate the accumulation of intermediate hydrolysis
products, making the conversion of complex organics to methane
thermodynamically favorable (Schink and Stams, 2013). The syntrophic interactions in the sludge BH systems will depend on the microbial community structures and compositions. Thus, the determination of bacterial and archaeal community structures of BH systems
would be of great importance for the understanding of microbial syntrophic interactions and process mechanisms of the sludge biological
hydrolysis.
Illumina MiSeq Sequencing is an eﬀective method for the characterization of microbial community structures. Compared to the conventional cultivation and biological molecular methods, Illumina MiSeq
Sequencing can generate an enormous number of sequences, providing
an excellent platform for the analysis of microorganism communities in
wastewater treatment systems (Lin et al., 2016; Sheng et al., 2017; Xie
et al., 2016; Zamanzadeh et al., 2016). With the use of Illumina MiSeq
sequencing platform, Xie et al. (2016) revealed that the phyla of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes were dominant in the hydrolysis acidiﬁcation reactors treating dyeing wastewater. Lin et al. (2016),
who investigated the eﬀect of temperature on microbial communities in
the anaerobic digestion of organic food waste, revealed that the phyla
of Firmicutes, Chloroﬂexi, Bacteoridetes, and Actinobacteria were dominant under mesophilic conditions while the phyla of Firmicutes, Thermotogo, Synergistales dominated under thermophilic conditions.
The objective of this study was to investigate the eﬀect of temperature on microorganism communities in the sludge BH systems.
Temperature is one of the most critical process parameters for the
sludge BH treatment. It can exert a critical impact on the types of microorganisms, fermentation pathways, and end-products of sludge BH.
In this study bench-scale hydrolysis and biochemical methane potential
(BMP) tests were carried out to assess the performance of sludge BH at
35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C. The high throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform was used to determine the microbial community structures at the BH temperatures tested. Based on the MiSeq sequencing
results, the characteristics of microbial community structures, syntrophic interactions and main functional fermenting bacteria under
mesophilic and thermophilic BH conditions were discussed.

2.2. Biochemical methane potential test
The biogas production from the hydrolyzed sludge was assessed
using the BMP method. The BMP test procedure followed those of Owen
et al.(1979) and Angelidaki et al. (2009) with modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy,
the main steps included (1) ﬁlling 30 mL of the hydrolyzed sludge and
the equal volume of seed sludge into a 125 mL serum bottles (American
Scientiﬁc Products, McGraw Park III); (2) ﬂushing the headspace of the
bottles with N2 for 15 s; and (3) capping the BMP bottles with rubbers
and aluminum crimp; and (4) placing the sealed BMP bottles upside
down in a shaking incubator (New Brunswick Scientiﬁc C25) with the
temperature setting at 35 °C. The BMP tests lasted for 10 days and the
biogas produced during the BMP test periods was measured using glass
syringes (Popper and Sons Inc.) ﬁtted with a disposable needle. BMP
bottles only ﬁlled with AD seed sludge and MilliQ water were used as
the blanks to estimate the biogas generated from the seed sludge. Triplicated BMP bottles were used for each of the hydrolysis temperature
conditions and the blanks.
2.3. DNA extraction
The PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MOBIO Laboratories, Inc.) was
used to extract DNA from the raw sludge and hydrolyzed sludge. The
sludge samples were centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min and the pellets
were used for DNA extraction according to the PowerSoil kit manufacture’s protocol. The extracted DNA was eluted using 100 μL sterile
DNA-Free PCR Grade Water. The extracted DNA was quantiﬁed by
using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc,
Canada) and stored at −20 °C for further use.
2.4. 16S rDNA gene ampliﬁcation and Illumina MiSeq sequencing
The primer pairs of 515F (5′-GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG-3′) and 926R
(5′-CCGTCAATTCMTTTGAGTTT-3′) that have been demonstrated to
have the high coverages of almost all phyla in metagenomic analyses
(Baker et al., 2003) were used to amplify the V4 and V5 regions of
bacterial 16S rRNA genes of the extracted DNA. The primer pairs of
519F (5′-CAGCCGCCGCGGTAA-3′) and 915R (5′-GTGCTCCCCCGCCAATTCCT-3′) were used to amplify the 16S rRNA genes of methanogenic
archaeal (Wei et al., 2015). The PCR reaction agent consisted of the
1 μL template, 1 μL of 10 mM dNTPs, 1 μL of 10 μM of primers, 1 U of
Phusion DNA Polymerase, and 10 μL of 5 × reaction buﬀer (New
England Biolabs, USA). The bacterial and archaeal PCR conditions were
programmed as: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles
for bacteria or 30 cycles for archaea at 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s,
extension at 72 °C for 30 s; with a ﬁnal extension of 72 °C for 5 min.
The Illumina Nextera XT Index kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego. CA,
USA) was used to attach 5′ MiSeq adapter and barcode to the amplicons
for multiplexing following the manufacture’s protocol. The amplicons
were puriﬁed using the DNA gel extraction kit of AxyPrepDNA (Axygen,
China) and quantiﬁed by using the FTC-3000TM real-time PCR before

2. Material and methods
2.1. Sludge source and hydrolysis experiments
The raw sludge (RS) and seed sludge used in the BMP tests were
taken, respectively, from the secondary clariﬁer and the anaerobic digester of Guelph Wastewater Treatment Plant, Ontario, Canada, and
were transported to the laboratory within 2 h.
For the BH experiments, the RS was ﬁlled into a 1.5 L plastic bottle
without addition of seed sludge, ﬂushed with N2 for 1 min, and then
sealed for hydrolysis reactions. The hydrolysis experiments at 35 °C,
42 °C, and 55 °C were carried out in parallel by placing these sludgeﬁlled plastic bottles into shaking incubators at the desired temperatures
for six days. The sludge solubilisation caused by the 6-day hydrolysis

library pooling. The puriﬁed multiplexed amplicons were sequenced by
the paired-end sequencing (2 × 300 bp reads) on the MiSeq platform
using MiSeq Reagent Kit V3 (TinyGene Bio-Tech, Co., Ltd. Shanghai,
China).
2.5. Illumina data analysis
All sequences were read and classiﬁed according to the barcodes
after sequencing on the MiSeq platform. The raw data were reverted as
the FASTQ ﬁle of the forward or reverse sequences for each sample. The
resulting sequences were processed mainly upon software of mothur
(version 1.35.1) following the pipeline outline of the MiSeq SOP
(Schloss et al., 2009). The remaining sequences after assembling of
contigs and ﬁltering of length and ambiguous reads were aligned with
the version 119 of SILVA databases (Pruesse et al., 2007). All reads of
the archaeal communities were merged and trimmed as bacteria.
Shannon index was used for the diversity calculation. The richnesses
were described based on the abundance-based coverage estimator
(ACE) and species richness estimators (Chao1). The microbiological
similarities for the sludge samples obtained under diﬀerent conditions
were calculated by the OTU overlapping in Venn diagram, and the
distances of variation of microbiological communities were presented
by the principal component analysis (PCA).
3. Results
3.1. Eﬀect of temperatures on the solid solubilization and biogas production
Experiments demonstrated that BH could result in a considerable
suspended solid solubilization and VFA production. Fig. 1a–c show the
TSS and VSS reductions, VFA concentrations, and VFA fractions at the
end of 6-day hydrolysis at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C. The VSS reductions of
35.4%, 37.3%, and 42.4% and TSS reductions of 28.9%, 31.0%, and
33.5% were achieved in the 6-day hydrolysis at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C,
respectively (Fig. 1a). Accordingly, the VFA concentrations in sludge
were increased from the initial concentration of 24.5 mg/L to
666.5 mg/L, 918.4 mg/L, and 1398.5 mg/L in the 6-d hydrolysis at
35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C, respectively. VFAs determined by the GC analysis in the hydrolyzed sludge included acetic acid, propionic acid,
isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, valeric acid, 4-methylvaleric acid (isocaproic), hexanoic acid (caproic), and heptanoic acid
(Fig. 1b). The concentration of acetic acid increased from 210.8 mg/L
at 35 °C, 356.1 mg/L at 42 °C, to 615.0 mg/L at 55 °C. The sum of the
concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric
acid, isovaleric acid, and valeric acid counted for 81.5%, 88.0%, and
92.3% of the total detected VFAs at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C, respectively. The fractions of acetic, isobutyric, and isovalric acid increased
while those of propionic acid, valeric acid, isocaproic, caproic, and
heptanoic acid reduced with the increase in the hydrolysis temperature
(Fig. 1c). These results indicated that BH temperature not only exerted
a positive eﬀect on the sludge solubilization and VFA productions but
also aﬀected the compositions of VFAs.
Sludge treated at diﬀerent BH temperatures was assessed for biogas
production using the BMP method outlined in Section 2.2. Fig. 2 shows
that the accumulated biogas produced by sludge hydrolyzed at 35 °C,
42, oC, and 55 °C. As shown in Fig. 2, sludge treated at 42 °C and 55 °C
showed a higher biogas production than that treated at 35 °C although
no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in biogas production from sludge treated at
diﬀerent temperatures was observed in the ﬁrst 50 h of the BMP tests.

All the eﬀective sequencing tags were clustering at a 97% similarity at
the species level, and more than 500 OTUs were obtained for each of
the individual samples. The Shannon index of the RS, BH35, BH42, and
BH55 sludge was 4.6, 4.5, 4.3, and 4.5 respectively, corresponding to
ACE of 602, 707, 675, and 730, respectively, and Chao1 of 606, 708,
694, and 740, respectively. The RS and the BH treated samples all
showed the high indexes, suggesting the high bacterial diversities and
richness of these sludge samples.
The Venn diagram reﬂects the similarity of the OTUs of the sludge
samples (Fig. 3). The samples tested had a total 380 overlapped OTUs
with 468 OTUs overlapped among the sludge hydrolyzed at 35 °C,
42 °C, and 55 °C. The overlapped OTUs between the RS and the hydrolyzed sludge were 473, 470, and 501 for the BH35, BH42, and BH55
sludge, respectively. It is interesting to note that there were more
overlapped OTUs between the BH55 and RS sludge than between the RS
and the BH35 or BH42 sludge. Similar to the OTU overlap analysis, the
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) also indicated that the microbial

3.2. Microbial community diversity of bacteria
Microbial communities at diﬀerent BH temperatures were characterized using the Illumine MiSeq sequencing platform. The average
total eﬀective sequencing tags were 62,439 for the RS, and 58,803,
67,348, and 73,988 for the BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge, respectively.

communities of the sludge treated at 55 °C had a higher similarity to the
RS than those treated at 35 °C and 42 °C (Fig. 3b).
3.3. Bacterial community structures
Fig. 4a shows the microbial abundances at the phylum level in the
RS and sludge treated at diﬀerent temperatures. For the RS, the
dominant phyla were Proteobacteria (59.2%) and Bacteroidetes (31.6%).
The dominant phyla with the BH35 sludge were Bacteroidetes (46.8%),
Firmicutes (19.8%), Proteobacteria (14.1%), and Spirochaetes (13.3%).
Similar to the BH35 sludge, the BH42 sludge contained Bacteroidetes
(37.9%), Firmicutes (30.9%), and Proteobacteria (25.2%). The dominant
phyla in the BH55 sludge were Proteobacteria (47.6%) and Firmicutes
(34.0%), plus a signiﬁcant amount of Actinobacteria (5.6%), Tenericutes
(4.1%), and Bacteroidetes (4.2%). Both the RS and BH55 sludge showed
a high population of bacteria belonging to Proteobacteria, which may
explain the high similarity in the 16S rRNA gene sequences between the
RS and BH55 sludge (Fig. 3b). At the phylum level, Firmicutes and
Proteobacteria populations increased with the BH temperatures, while
Bacteroidetes decreased dramatically at 55 °C (Fig. 4a–c).
At the class level, the top 5 predominant classes in the RS were βproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Sphingobacteriia, α-proteobacteria, and γproteobacteria, which accounted for 30.8%, 14.9%, 14.7%, 13.3%, and
11.2% of total detected OTUs, respectively (Fig. 4b). After the RS had
been hydrolyzed at 35 °C for six days, the dominant classes in the sludge
changed to Bacteroidia (33.3%), unclassiﬁed (19.0%), Clostridia
(15.9%), α-proteobacteria (6.3%), and Spirochaetes (4.1%) (Fig. 4b),
showing that the anaerobic hydrolysis caused a substantial reduction in
the population of β-proteobacteria, Flavobacteria, and γ-proteobacteria.
The dominant classes with the BH42 sludge were Clostridia (30.4%),
Bacteroidia (30.2%), β-proteobacteria (10.7%), α-proteobacteria (6.1%),
and γ-proteobacteria (6.3%). The BH55 sludge was dominated by the
class Clostridia (28.1%), β-proteobacteria (23.2%), α-Proteobacteria
(11.4%), γ-proteobacteria (11.2%), and Negativicutes (5.5%). The bacteria associated with the classes of Clostridia and β-Proteobacteria evidently increased with the increase in temperature. Thus, Clostridia was
identiﬁed as the dominant class of phylum Firmicutes in the BH35,
BH42, and BH55 sludge and Bacteroidia as the dominant class of the
phylum of Bacteroidetes in the BH35 and BH42 sludge.
Table 1 shows the main families identiﬁed for RS, BH35, BH42, and
BH55 sludge. Apparently, the family structures of the sludge treated at
diﬀerent temperatures were considerably diﬀerent. For the BH35 and
BH42 sludge samples, around 30% of the identiﬁed OTUs belonged to
Rikenellaceae and Porphyromonadaceae, while the fractions of these two
families in the BH55 sludge drastically decreased to less than 3%. Also,
the family Spirochaetaceae that has members to metabolize carbohydrates and amino acids showed a signiﬁcant presence in BH35 sludge
but much less in the BH42 and BH55 sludge. In addition, the families of
Comamonadaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Thermoanaerobacteraceae
dominated at 55 °C but only existed as minor groups in the BH35 and
BH42 sludge samples.
The fractions of OTUs of unclassiﬁed genera were 32.8%, 60.1%,
51.0%, and 33.4% for the RS, BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge, respectively. It is interesting to note that the percentages of unclassiﬁed
genera in the BH sludge decreased signiﬁcantly with the increase in the
hydrolysis temperature. For the identiﬁed genera, Flavobacterium,
Zoogloea, Haliscomenobacter, and Novosphingobium counted for 12.2%,
9.6% 4.2%, and 4.0% of the total OTUs, respectively, in the RS
(Fig. 4c). The dominant bacterial genera in the sludge switched to
Macellibacteroides (7.5%) and Acidaminobacter (5.6%) after being hydrolyzed at 35 °C for six days. Lutispora (9.8%), Albidiferax (4.3%), and
Proteiniphilum (4.5%) were the three predominant genera identiﬁed in
the BH42 sludge. For the BH55 sludge, the genera of Gelria (7.2%),
Albidiferax (5.6%), Simplicispira (4.4%), and Hialoplasma (4.0%) were
identiﬁed as the dominant groups. Overall, the identiﬁed bacteria
genera structures with the RS, BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge were very

in the BH35 sludge; and Methanobacteriaceae and Methanosarcinaceae
accounted for 56.0% and 38.3%, respectively, in the BH42 sludge. As
the temperature increased from 42 °C to 55 °C, the percentage of Methanobacteriaceae increased to 80%, while Methanocorpusculaceae and
Methanosarcinaceae were down to 11.6% and 7.0%, respectively.
At the genus level, the predominant archaea grew at BH35 were

tested sludge but the distributions of these two classes were diﬀerent in
the sludge treated at diﬀerent temperatures. The class of Methanomicrobia accounted for 84% of the total archaeal OTUs for the BH35
sludge, 40% for the BH42 sludge, and 19% for the BH55 sludge, while
Methanobacteria accounted for 14% for the BH35 sludge, 56% for the

4. Discussion
4.1. Impact of biological hydrolysis temperature on microbial structures
The experimental data obtained in this study showed the impact of
temperatures on the BH of sewage sludge. The sludge BH at 55 °C enhanced the reduction of suspended solid (TSS and VSS) and production
of VFA, in agreement with the previous studies reported by Zhang et al.
(2009), who showed that the VSS reduction by thermophilic fermentation was greater than that by mesophilic fermentation. These notable
processing changes of hydrolyzed sludge at diﬀerent BH temperatures
were further linked to the change in the bacterial and archaeal structure
by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Taxonomic identiﬁcation showed the
shifts of microbiological structures with the BH35, BH42, and BH55
sludge at diﬀerent levels in present work. Most of the microbiology was
clearly classiﬁed to the family level, which revealed the signiﬁcant

The complex organics in sludge BH can be degraded by primary and
secondary fermentative bacteria (Schink and Stams, 2013). This study
revealed that the hydrolysis temperature could exert signiﬁcant impact
on the types of fermentative bacteria in the sludge BH systems. Table 2
summarized the main genera identiﬁed at 35 °C, 42 °C, and 55 °C that
may contain typical protein and carbohydrate fermenting bacterial
species, most of which were isolated from wastewater treatment systems. The main protein fermenting bacteria could be associated with
the genera of Acidaminobacter at 35 °C, Lutispora and Proteiniphilum at
42 °C, and Gelria, Tepidimicrobium, and Lutispora (2.0%) at 55 °C. All of
these genera excepting Proteiniphilum belong to the order of clostridials.
The physiology characteristics of these identiﬁed protein fermenting
genera were illustrated in Table 2 based on those of the isolated species
reported previously by other researchers.
The dominant carbohydrates fermenting bacteria also varied in the
BH35, BH42, and BH55 sludge (Table 2). The genus Macellibacteroides
was determined to be the main carbohydrate degrading bacteria in the
BH35 sludge. The isolated species of Macellibacteroides can utilize a
broad range of mono- and disaccharides as electron donors with the
main fermentation products to be lactate, acetate, butyrate and isobutyrate from glucose metabolism (Jabari et al., 2012). Other carbohydrates fermenting bacteria detected in BH35 sludge could be associated with the genera of Paludibacter and Fusibacter (Ueki et al., 2006;
Ravot et al., 1999). For the sludge hydrolysis at 42 °C, the main

diﬀerence in the microbial communities between the mesophilic
(BH35 & BH 42) and thermophilic (BH55) hydrolysis systems.
Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria accounted for more than 90% of the total identiﬁed OTUs in the BH35,
BH42, and BH55 sludge. These phyla were also identiﬁed as the
dominant bacteria phyla, by other researchers, in the wastewater hydrolysis acidiﬁcation reactors (Xie et al., 2016), the anaerobic sewage
sludge co-digestion reactors (Yang et al., 2016), and the conventional
anaerobic digesters (Nelson et al., 2011). Considering the complexity of
microbiology in wastewater treatment systems, the descriptions of
bacterial roles at class and family levels were widely accepted. For
example, the classes of Clostridia and Bacteroidia that were found as
dominant bacteria in the present study were previously depicted by
Yang et al. (2015b) as dominant classes in Geobacillus sp. G1 hydrolysis
of ultrasonic pretreated wasted activated sludge (WAS). Clostridia
contained many types of fermentative organisms that produce hydrogen
along with acetate, butyrate, ethanol, etc. (Arreola-Vargas et al., 2013),
while Bacteroidia were reported playing a vital role in decomposing
solid wastes and generating organic acids (Wong et al., 2013). In this
study, the classes of Clostridia and Bacteroidia accounted for total fractions of 49.3% and 60.6% of the identiﬁed OTUs in the BH35 and BH42
sludge, respectively. It can be speculated that bacteria associated with
these classes played a major role in the mesophilic sludge solubilization
and VFA production, while the class of Clostridia that counted for 28.1%
of total OTUs in the BH55 sludge should play a major role in the sludge
thermophilic fermentation. At the family level, the family Rikenellaceae
associated with the order Bacteroidales was identiﬁed as a major bacterial family (17.3%) in BH35. The members of Rikenellaceae are
anaerobic bacteria that usually use carbohydrates or proteins (Su et al.,
2013). This study also showed that the family Ruminococcaceae increased sharply with the increase of the BH temperature. It was reported that bacteria associated with the Ruminococcaceae family can
grow rapidly on cellulose and hemicellulose (Ali Shah et al., 2014). The
considerably increased Ruminococcaceae population at 55 °C might
suggest that the degradation of cellulose components of sewage sludge
can be enhanced by thermophilic BH, which could, to some extent,
contribute to the increased VSS reduction and VFAs productions at
55 °C.

conversion of organic to acetic acid. It is well-known that thermophilic
conditions favor the growth of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. The
presence of hydrogenotrophic methanogens could be critical to the effective conversion of complex organics to acetate and other methanogen usable organics although methane production is not a primary
objective of the BH. Thus, the higher acetate fractions obtained at 55 °C
could be, to some extent, related to the enhanced syntrophic interactions between diﬀerent groups of organisms.

carbohydrate fermenting bacteria were likely associated with the
genera of Fronticella (3.2%), Macellibacteroides (3.2%), and Paludibacter
(2.8%). For BH55, dominant bacteria Gelria and Tepidimicrobium that
can use both protein and carbohydrate were not found in BH 35 and
BH42, implying that thermophilic selected bacteria can exert a strong
function in degradation of complex organics. In addition, some facultative bacteria, Simplicispira, Hydrogenophaga and Thermomonas,
which can use nitrate as the electron acceptor (Gao et al., 2011;
Kampfer et al., 2005; Mergaert et al., 2003), were found at a signiﬁcant
amount in BH55, likely related to the relatively high NO3−-N concentrations (∼30 mg/L) in the secondary sludge used in this study.
It is worth noting that bacteria associated with the genera of
Macellibacteroides, Paludibacter, Fonticellla, and Tepidimicrobium were
reported to be able to utilize sugars from the hydrolysis of cellulose and
hemicellulose, including xylose, arabinose, cellobiose, and mannose,
etc. This may imply that these carbohydrates fermenting bacterial could
play an important role in degrading cellulose and hemicellulose materials to VFAs (Table 2).

5. Conclusions
The results showed that the volatile suspended solids (VSS) reduction, volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, and biogas production increased with the increase in the BH temperature. The Illumina MiSeq
sequencing analysis revealed: Bacteroidetes (46.8%), Firmicutes (19.8%),
Proteobacteria (14.1%), and Spirochaetes (13.3%) dominated in the
BH35 sludge; Bacteroidetes (37.9%), Firmicutes (30.9%), and
Proteobacteria (25.2%) dominated in the BH42 sludge, and
Proteobacteria (47.6%) and Firmicutes (34.0%) dominated in the BH55
sludge. The microbial structure analysis showed that the dominant
protein and carbohydrate fermenting bacterial and hydrogen consuming methanogens varied in the sludge hydrolyzed at 35 °C, 42 °C
and 55 °C.

4.3. Microbial syntrophic interactions
The protein- and carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria identiﬁed in the
BH systems could produce a wide range of VFAs from fermentation of
amino acids and sugars (Table 2). The VFA analysis conﬁrmed that
acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid,
valeric acid, 4-methylvaleric acid (isocaproic), hexanoic acid (caproic),
and heptanoic acid were produced in the BH systems. Methanogens can
only utilize acetate, H2, CO2, formate, etc. for methane production.
Some secondary fermentation processes will degrade fatty acids with
chains longer than 2 carbon atoms, alcohols longer than one carbon
atoms, and branched-chain VFAs, and aromatic VFAs to acetate for
methane production (Schink and Stams, 2013). However, most of the
secondary fermentation processes are only thermodynamically favorable at low H2 partial pressures, e.g. < 10−5 bar. Thus, the presence of
hydrogen-consuming bacteria could be critical for the secondary fermentation reactions to be carried on in the BH systems. In this study,
the main hydrogen-consuming bacteria could be hydrogenotrophic
methanogens, including Methanocorpusculum in the BH35 sludge, Methanobrevibacter and Methanosarcina in the BH42 sludge, and Methanothermobacter in the BH55 sludge. The methanogens associated with
Methanocorpusculum, Methanobrevibacter and Methanothermobacter were
all hydrogenotrophic methanogens that produce methane from CO2 and
H2 (Nakamura et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2015), while members of Methanosarcina can use acetate and reduce CO2 with H2 for methane
production (Leahy et al., 2017). In addition to hydrogenotrophic methanogens, other H2-utilizing bacteria identiﬁed in the BH systems in
this study could include Fusibacter (Ravot et al., 1999) with the BH35
sludge and Tepidimicrobium (Niu et al., 2009) with the BH55 sludge.
Bacteria associated with these genera could reduce thiosulfate using H2
as electron donor (Escoﬃer et al., 1998). In the BH42 and BH55 sludge
around 4.3%–5.6% OTUs were identiﬁed associated with the genus of
Albidiferax. This genus contains Fe (III) and Mn (IV) reducing bacteria
that could also be potential H2 consumers.
Acidaminobacter and Gelria identiﬁed in the BH35 and BH55 sludge
could be syntrophic partners with hydrogen-consuming bacteria. Stams
and Hansen (1984) reported that the rate of the conversion of glutamate to acetate by Acidaminobacter hydrogenoformans was greatly enhanced in the mixed cultures with sulfate-reducing bacterium of Desulfobulbus propionicus or H2 utilizing Methanospirillum hungatei. The
bacteria associated with Gelria was reported to co-operate with the
hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum to degrade
glutamate into propionate, H2, NH4, and CO2 and ferment sugars to
acetate, propionate, CO2, and H2 (Plugge et al., 2002).
The VFA analysis showed that the total fractions of VFAs longer
than 2 carbon atoms were 68.7% for BH35, 61.2% for BH42, and 56.0%
for BH55, showing a positive impact of hydrolysis temperatures on the

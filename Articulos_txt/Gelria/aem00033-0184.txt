Oxidation of succinate to fumarate is an energetically difficult step in the biochemical pathway of propionate
oxidation by syntrophic methanogenic cultures. Therefore, the effect of fumarate on propionate oxidation by
two different propionate-oxidizing cultures was investigated. When the methanogens in a newly enriched
propionate-oxidizing methanogenic culture were inhibited by bromoethanesulfonate, fumarate could act as an
apparent terminal electron acceptor in propionate oxidation. "3C-nuclear magnetic resonance experiments
showed that propionate was carboxylated to succinate while fumarate was partly oxidized to acetate and partly
reduced to succinate. Fumarate alone was fermented to succinate and CO2. Bacteria growing on fumarate were
enriched and obtained free of methanogens. Propionate was metabolized by these bacteria when either
fumarate or Methanospirillum hungatii was added. In cocultures with Syntrophobacter wolinii, such effects were
not observed upon addition of fumarate. Possible slow growth of S. wolinii on fumarate could not be
demonstrated because of the presence of a Desulfovibrio strain which grew rapidly on fumarate in both the
absence and presence of sulfate.

Propionate is an important intermediate in the conversion
of complex organic carbon to methane and carbon dioxide.
Up to 15% of total methanogenesis is derived from the
degradation of propionate to acetate and carbon dioxide (10,
19). Propionate oxidation is accomplished by obligate syntrophic consortia of proton-reducing acetogenic bacteria and
methanogenic bacteria (1, 8, 10, 19). Because propionate
oxidation to acetate and carbon dioxide is energetically very
unfavorable, methanogens or sulfate-reducing bacteria are
needed to make propionate oxidation feasible either by
hydrogen consumption (1, 4, 9, 10) or by formate consumption (3, 25). A few syntrophic propionate-oxidizing cultures
have been described (2, 4, 17, 19-21). Thus far, Syntrophobacter wolinii is the only described propionate-oxidizing
bacterium which was obtained in a defined coculture with a
Desulfovibrio strain (2). Syntrophic propionate-oxidizing
bacteria are highly specialized; propionate is thought to be
the only substrate for this type of organism. Because propionate-oxidizing bacteria cannot be grown on propionate in
the absence of hydrogenotrophs, their biochemical and
physiological properties are difficult to assess.
Labelling experiments with 13C- and 14C-labelled substrates and enzyme measurements in cell extracts of syntrophic cultures have shown that the methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) pathway is involved in propionate oxidation
by syntrophic cultures (13-15, 17, 19, 21). In this route,
propionyl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, succinate, fumarate, malate, oxaloacetate, pyruvate, and acetylCoA are intermediates. The carboxylation of propionyl-CoA
is coupled to the decarboxylation of oxaloacetate by means
of a transcarboxylase (14, 15). When the different steps of
syntrophic propionate oxidation are compared (Table 1), it is
obvious that oxidation of succinate to fumarate coupled to
hydrogen formation is the most difficult step in propionate
oxidation. It might be advantageous for syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria to omit succinate oxidation when
*

fumarate is present. Propionate would then be converted to
succinate, while fumarate is oxidized to acetate. Research
was started to investigate the effect of fumarate on propionate oxidation by syntrophic cultures. Results with a newly
enriched propionate-oxidizing methanogenic culture and
with sulfidogenic and methanogenic cultures with S. wolinii
are presented.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Organisms. A newly enriched propionate-oxidizing methanogenic culture originating from the work of Jan Dolfing at
our department (7) is described herein. The S. woliniiDesulfovibrio strain Gll coculture (DSM 2805) and Methanospirillum hungatii JF-1 (DSM 864) were obtained from the
Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen (Braunschweig,
Germany). An S. wolinii-M. hungatii culture, in which
Desulfovibrio strain Gll was present only as a contaminant,
was obtained by subculturing in propionate-media without
sulfate.
Media and cultivation. A basal bicarbonate-buffered medium contained the following (grams per liter):
Na2HPO4 2H20, 0.53; KH2PO4, 0.41; NH4Cl, 0.3;
CaCl2- 2H20, 0.11; MgCl2 6H20, 0.10; NaCl, 0.3;
NaHCO3, 4.0; and Na2S. 9H20, 0.48 (as well as acid and
alkaline trace elements [each, 1 ml/liter] and vitamins [0.2
ml/liter]). The acid trace element solution contained the
following (millimolar): FeCl2, 7.5; H3B04, 1; ZnCl2, 0.5;
CuCl2, 0.1; MnCl2, 0.5; CoCl2, 0.5; NiCl2 0.1; and HCl, 50.
The alkaline trace element solution was composed of the
following (millimolar): Na2SeO3, 0.1; Na2WO4, 0.1;
Na2MoO4, 0.1; and NaOH, 10. The vitamin solution had the
following composition (gram per liter): biotin, 0.02; niacin,
0.2; pyridoxine, 0.5; riboflavin, 0.1; thiamine, 0.2; cyanocobalamin, 0.1; p-aminobenzoic acid, 0.1; and pantothenic
acid, 0.1. Media for the coculture with S. wolinii were
supplemented with 0.02% BBL yeast extract (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) and 2.8 g of Na2SO4 per liter, and
media for M. hungatii were supplemented with 0.02% BBL

yeast extract, 0.04% bioTrypticase (bioMerieux, Charbonnieres les Bains, France), and 0.15 g of sodium acetate per
liter. Routinely, bacteria were cultured at 37°C in 120-ml
serum vials with 50 ml of medium and a gas phase of 1.7 atm
(172.2 kPa) N2-CO2 or H2-CO2 (80:20, vol/vol). Bottles were
sealed with butyl rubber stoppers (Rubber BV, Hilversum,
The Netherlands) and aluminum caps. Vitamins and bromoethanesulfonate (BrES) were filter sterilized; other compounds were sterilized by heat. Unless stated otherwise,
substrates were added from 1 M stock solutions to give a
final concentration of 20 mM. In most experiments, media
were inoculated with stock cultures which had been stored
between 15 and 20°C. Growth rates were estimated by
monitoring the optical density at 600 nm or product formation of duplicate bottles. For this, substrate-adapted and
actively growing cultures were inoculated (the inoculum size
was 10%) in fresh media. Experiments to determine CO2
formation were done with phosphate-buffered media. Bicarbonate (50 mM) was replaced by 30 mM sodium phosphate
(pH 7), and the gas phase was N2 instead of N2-CO2.
Analytical methods. Organic acids were measured with an
LKB high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC)
equipped with a Chrompack organic acid column (30 cm by
6.5 mm). The mobile phase was 0.01 N H2SO4 at a flow rate
of 0.6 ml/min. The column temperature was 60°C. Samples
(20 pl) were injected by using a Spectra Physics autosampler
(SP 8775). Compounds eluting were quantified by differential
refractometry by an LKB 2142 refractometer. Acetate,
propionate, and other fatty acids were also measured by gas
chromatography (GC) with a CP9000 gas chromatograph
(Chrompack, Middelburg, The Netherlands) equipped with a
glass column (inside dimensions, 180 cm by 2 mm) filled with
Chromosorb 101 (80/100 mesh). The carrier gas was nitrogen
saturated with formic acid. The temperatures of the injection
port and the detector were 250 and 300°C, respectively. The
temperature of the column was maintained at 160 or 180°C.
With both HPLC and GC the detection limit for compounds
was about 0.1 mM. Methane and hydrogen levels were
measured by GC with a Packard-Becker 417 gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and
molecular sieve 13 x (60/80 mesh). The column temperature
was 50°C, and the carrier gas was argon at a flow rate of 20
ml/min. CO2 levels were measured by GC in a fashion similar
to that used for the other gases. However, a Poropak Q
column was used, and helium was the carrier gas. Bicarbonate was determined by the same method as CO2; culture
samples (2.5 ml) were injected into closed 18-ml Hungate
tubes, and 2.5 ml of 1 M HCl was added to purge the CO2
from the liquid phase. L-Malate was measured enzymatically
with L-malate dehydrogenase (11).

Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Nuclear magnetic resonance experiments were performed as follows.
Media (5 ml) were prepared in 18-ml Hungate tubes. In
experiments to demonstrate involvement of the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway, media contained 20 mM [3-13Cjpropionate or 10 mM [2,3-13C]propionate plus 10 mM unlabeled
propionate. In experiments to study the fate of propionate in
the presence of fumarate, media contained 20 mM
[3-13C]propionate and 10 mM BrES in the presence or
absence of 40 mM fumarate. [3-'3C]propionate and [2,313C]propionate (minimum of 99 atom% 13C) were obtained
from Isotec (Miamisburg, Md.). Tubes were inoculated
(10%) with the propionate-oxidizing culture and incubated
for 2 weeks at 37°C. Cells were centrifuged, and D20 (10%,
vol/vol) was added to the supernatant. 13C-labelled compounds were analyzed with a Bruker CXP-300 FourierTransform spectrometer as described previously (13).
Other methods. Phase-contrast photographs were made
with a Wild phase-contrast microscope. Gram staining was
done according to standard procedures (6).

RESULTS
Origin and description of the newly enriched culture. The
propionate-oxidizing culture originated from the research of
Dolfing (7). Methanogenic granular sludge of a bench-scale
upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor, which had been
operated for several months with a mixture of propionate
and acetate as feed, was used as starting material for the
enrichment of propionate-oxidizing bacteria. The culture
was enriched in 1983 and regularly subcultured in media with
propionate as the sole substrate. Thereafter, it had been
stored for about 2 years at room temperature in the dark
before subculturing was continued in 1987. The propionatedegrading culture mainly consisted of gram-negative, short,
rod-shaped bacteria (1.1 to 1.6 by 1.8 to 2.5 ,um) and a
Methanospirillum sp. (about 0.8 ,um in width). The culture
was highly purified but was not yet a defined coculture. Even
after repeated transfer and dilution in fresh media, small
coccoid bacteria remained present in low numbers (less than
1%). These contaminants could be enriched and isolated
with yeast extract as a substrate. Yeast extract was fermented by this organism to acetate, isobutyrate, butyrate,
and isovalerate (or P-methylbutyrate) in a molar ratio of
about 20:2:3:6. This bacterium was also able to grow on
glucose or pyruvate. However, it was unable to grow on
propionate, succinate, malate, or fumarate, neither in the
absence nor in the presence of M. hungatii JF-1 (DSM 864).
It is possible that the coccoid bacterium is maintained in the
propionate-oxidizing culture by growth on cell lysis prod-

ucts. The Methanospirillum sp. could be enriched with
hydrogen plus carbon dioxide or formate as energy substrates. This methanogen morphologically and physiologically resembled M. hungatii JF-1 (DSM 864). In our media,
both strains had an absolute requirement for bioTrypticase,
and growth was stimulated by addition of sodium acetate (2
mM) to the media. Remarkably, the Methanospirillum sp.
did not require bioTrypticase during syntrophic growth with
propionate-oxidizing bacteria, which suggests the occurrence of cross-feeding. Bacteria with other morphologies
were never observed. The propionate-oxidizing culture converted propionate in the expected stoichiometry: 24.1 + 1.0
mol of propionate yielded 23 + 1.8 mol of acetate and 17.3 +
0.7 mol of methane. The apparent maximum specific growth
rate, estimated from the increase in acetate concentration in
time, was between 0.15 and 0.17 day-1. Labelling experiments showed that [3-13Clpropionate was converted to equal
amounts of [1-13C1- and [2- 3Clacetate. In addition, [2,313Cjpropionate in the presence of unlabelled propionate was
solely converted to [1,2-13CJacetate (results not shown).
Effect of fumarate and malate on propionate oxidation.
Addition of L-malate to the propionate-oxidizing culture led
to an instantaneous and stoichiometric formation of succinate (Fig. 1). When DL-malate was added, only the L-isomer
was consumed. Succinate formation was also observed with
fumarate, whereas D-malate, malonate, and maleate were
not metabolized. All of the observations presented below
were obtained with fumarate, but similar results were also
obtained with L-malate. These two compounds were interconverted to some extent in the culture. Table 2 shows that
in presence of fumarate less methane was produced per
amount of propionate which had been oxidized. Addition of
BrES, a specific inhibitor of methanogenesis, led to a complete inhibition of propionate oxidation. However, in BrESinhibited cultures, propionate was converted when fumarate
was present as well. These observations suggested that
hydrogen consumption by methanogens can be replaced by
addition of fumarate. Dense hydrogen-pregrown cultures of
M. hungatii JF-1 (DSM 864) and the Methanospirillum sp.
were unable to reduce fumarate to succinate with hydrogen
or formate as the electron donor in the presence of BrES.
This shows that the methanogens do not shift their metabo-

lism from methane formation to fumarate reduction when
methanogenesis is inhibited in the propionate-oxidizing culture. In BrES-inhibited propionate-oxidizing cultures
[3-13Cjpropionate is randomized to some extent to
[2-13CJpropionate, while no net degradation of propionate
occurred (Fig. 2B). However, when fumarate is present in
BrES-inhibited cultures, label originating from propionate
was mainly recovered in succinate, while no label in acetate
above the natural occurring background level of 1.1% was
recovered (Fig. 2A). This shows that the acetate must have
been formed from the unlabeled fumarate.

FUMARATE UTILIZATION BY PROPIONATE-OXIDIZING BACTERIA

absence of propionate was degraded as well (Table 2).
Fumarate degradation was coupled to growth, and compared
with syntrophic growth on propionate, high cell densities
were obtained. Succinate was the sole organic end product
detected by HPLC and GC methods (the detection limit of
compounds was about 0.1 mM). Because reducing equivalents are needed for conversion of fumarate to succinate,
part of the fumarate must have been oxidized to carbon
dioxide. Formation of carbon dioxide was confirmed by
using phosphate-buffered media. In this case, we found that
25.2 mmol of fumarate was converted into 19.5 mmol of
succinate and 15.5 mmol of CO2. Similar values were found
in the presence of BrES, and only minor amounts of methane
were formed in the absence of BrES. By repeated transfer
and dilution in fumarate media, a microscopically homogeneous culture was obtained. Methanogens were completely
removed; even after months of incubation, methane formation from hydrogen or formate did not occur. The bacteria
growing on fumarate resembled the propionate-oxidizing
bacteria in the propionate-degrading culture. However, the
average size was somewhat larger (1.3 to 1.8 by 1.8 to 3.8
pm). The coccoid contaminant remained present in the
culture in very low numbers. The fumarate-degrading culture grew best when dense inocula of 5 to 10% were used.
When a small inoculum (1% or less) was used, cultures had
a long lag phase before growth started. Later experiments
showed that the lag phase could be shortened considerably
by adding 0.1 mM dithionite to the media, suggesting that a
low redox potential is beneficial for growth. Growth on
fumarate was relatively slow; the estimated maximum specific growth rate was about 0.20 day-'. The fumaratedegrading culture fermented fumarate plus propionate to
succinate plus acetate in the same fashion as described
above for the BrES-inhibited propionate-oxidizing culture,
and in presence of hydrogen or formate, fumarate was
stoichiometrically transformed to succinate. Under these
conditions, growth was slower than with fumarate alone.
The estimated specific growth rate in media with propionate
plus fumarate (20 and 60 mM, respectively) was about 0.16
day-1. The culture, which was enriched with fumarate, was
unable to degrade propionate in the absence of fumarate.
However, propionate was degraded when M. hungatii JF-1
(DSM 864) was added (Fig. 3). In these experiments, it was
confirmed that the methanogen alone was not able to degrade propionate. We tried to isolate fumarate-degrading
bacteria with fumarate (20 mM) or with fumarate (40 mM)
plus propionate (20 mM) in agar media in roll tubes or in agar
shake cultures. These attempts were not successful, because
the bacteria failed to form colonies. Addition of yeast extract
(0.1%) to the media led to colonies of the contaminant only.
Fumarate utilization by cultures with S. wofinii. The effect
of fumarate on propionate oxidation by a methanogenic and
a sulfidogenic culture with S. wolinu was investigated. In
both cultures, Desulfovibrio strain Gll was present either as
the hydrogenotroph (sulfidogenic culture) or as a contaminant (methanogenic culture). Like in the original description
of S. wolinii, we were unable to get a defined coculture of the
proton-reducing acetogen with M. hungatu (2). The Desulfo
vibrio strain was able to degrade fumarate both in the
presence and in the absence of sulfate. In the absence of
sulfate, strain Gll fermented fumarate to succinate and
acetate in the expected stoichiometries, whereas in the
presence of sulfate (results not shown) or M. hungatii, less
succinate and more acetate were formed (Table 3). The
Desulfovibrio sp. grew only very slowly in media with
succinate and sulfate, whereas we did not observe syn-

trophic growth of the Desulfovibrio sp. on succinate in the
absence of sulfate but the presence of M. hungatii (results
not shown). The sulfidogenic coculture was unable to degrade propionate in the presence of fumarate in sulfate-free
media. However, fumarate was fermented rapidly to acetate
and succinate. This suggested that, under those conditions,
interspecies electron transfer does not occur. Thus, the
sulfate reducer preferred fermentative growth on fumarate
above growth by fumarate reduction with reducing equivalents derived from propionate oxidation by S. wolinii. In the
methanogenic propionate-oxidizing culture, the Desulfovibrio sp. was present only in low cell numbers (about 1%).
Propionate, fumarate, and fumarate plus propionate were
mainly converted to acetate by this methanogenic propionate-oxidizing culture, and methane was produced in the
expected amounts (results not shown). This indicates that
the two substrates were both degraded to acetate via interspecies electron transfer. The Desulfovibrio .sp. was enriched in the media with fumarate as the substrate, whereas
the numbers of S. wolinii increased with propionate as the
substrate. When propionate and fumarate were both present,
increased numbers of both species were found. Because of
the fast growth of the Desulfovibrio sp. on fumarate, a
possible slow conversion of fumarate by S. wolinu could not
be assessed.
DISCUSSION
Three important observations were made when fumarate
(or malate) was added to a newly enriched syntrophic

propionate-oxidizing culture. (i) The difficult succinate-oxidation step is avoided. (ii) Fumarate could replace methanogens as an apparent electron acceptor in propionate oxidation. (iii) Fumarate in the absence of propionate was
fermented to succinate and carbon dioxide. From the experiments with labelled propionate, it is evident that in media
with fumarate plus propionate, the following sequence of
reactions takes place in the propionate-oxidizing methanogenic culture: [3-13C]propionate + CO2 -+ [2-13C]succinate,
1 fumarate -> 1 acetate + 2CO2 + 4[H], and 2 fumarate plus
4[H] -- 2 succinate. Thus, propionate is not oxidized to
acetate but is solely carboxylated to succinate. Carboxylation of propionate to succinate is an energy-requiring reaction; the AG"' is +20.5 kJ/mol. Therefore, this conversion is
possible only if it is coupled to another energy-yielding
reaction. A similar carboxylation of propionate to succinate
was recently demonstrated for Propionibactenum freudenreichii (22). This propionigenic bacterium contains a propionyl-CoA-oxaloacetate transcarboxylase, an enzyme which
drives the endergonic carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to
methylmalonyl-CoA by the exergonic decarboxylation of
oxaloacetate to pyruvate. This bacterium lacks an oxaloacetate decarboxylase, and therefore it can ferment fumarate
only to succinate and acetate when propionate is present as
a carboxyl acceptor.
Growth of the propionate-oxidizing culture on fumarate
alone was rather unexpected. We made use of this property
to obtain a culture which was microscopically pure and
completely free of methanogens. This highly purified culture
fermented fumarate to succinate and CO2 according to the
sequence 7 fumarate -- 6 succinate + 4CO2, as was also
found for some other fumarate-fermenting anaerobes (5, 18).
In the presence of hydrogen or formate fumarate was stoichiometrically converted to succinate. The culture carboxylated propionate to succinate, while fumarate was no longer
oxidized to CO2 but to acetate. In addition, the culture
oxidized propionate to acetate in the presence of M. hungatii
JF-1 (DSM 864), an organism which is unable to metabolize
propionate. The fact that only one morphological type of
bacterium was present under either growth condition may
indicate that the syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria
are involved in all of these reactions. Besides, the shift from
CO2 to acetate formation from fumarate in the presence of

propionate and the simultaneous energy-dependent carboxylation of propionate can be explained satisfactorily only if
one bacterial species is involved. However, direct evidence
for this is possible only after a pure culture has been
obtained. Thus far, we did not succeed because the propionate-oxidizing bacteria failed to grow in solid media, and
with serial dilutions in liquid media we were not able to get
rid of a contaminating fermenting organism with characteristic morphology. We were able to isolate this contaminant
and could show that its metabolism does not interfere with
the fumarate and propionate metabolism of the propionateoxidizing bacteria.
Thus far, proton-reducing propionate-oxidizing bacteria
were thought to use only propionate for growth. Because
this substrate is degraded in syntrophy with hydrogenotrophic bacteria, detailed biochemical and physiological
studies with these proton-reducing acetogens are not possible, the more so because attempts to grow syntrophic
propionate-oxidizing bacteria in the absence of methanogens
with artificial electron removal systems were not successful
(16). Our findings could make syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria accessible for further study.
It remains to be studied in detail whether fumarate utilization by propionate-oxidizing bacteria is restricted to a few
species of syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria. Our
earlier findings (12) with a propionate-oxidizing culture enriched by Koch et al. (17) and results presented here with S.
wolinii suggest that fumarate utilization is not common
among syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria. However,
in a study with a highly purified thermophilic syntrophic
culture, we have obtained evidence for an advantageous
effect of fumarate on propionate oxidation. In the presence
of fumarate, this thermophilic culture carboxylated propionate to succinate and oxidized fumarate to acetate in a
fashion similar to the culture described here, but growth with
fumarate alone or propionate oxidation coupled to fumarate
reduction was not found (23).

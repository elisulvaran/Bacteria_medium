Microbial population size, community structure, and diversity, and the correlations of these characteristics with process variables were investigated in samples taken seasonally over two years from a full-scale
thermophilic anaerobic digester treating food waste-recycling wastewater (FRW). The organic component of the FRW consisted of carbohydrate (35% of volatile solids), protein (34%) and lipid (30%). The
chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency of the anaerobic digestion (AD) system negatively
correlated with Na+ (2.9–7.7 g/L) and lipid (3.3–22.8 g/L) concentrations, which varied significantly over
the two years. Tepidanaerobacter, Anaerobaculum, Defluviitoga, Keratinibaculum, Gelria, Tepidimicrobium,
Caldicoprobacter, Bacillus, and Syntrophaceticus were the major bacterial genera, and Methanoculleus
and Methanobacterium were the major archaeal genera. Concentrations of Na+ and lipid in the digester
were negatively correlated with total bacterial and archaeal populations determined by real-time
quantitative PCR. These concentrations could also significantly affect the bacterial community structure
(e.g., negative correlations with Gelria), but not archaeal community structure. Lipid concentration was
negatively correlated with bacterial diversity, but was not correlated with archaeal diversity. Ammonia
concentration in the digester (2.0–4.3 g N/L) had no significant correlation with COD removal or total
bacterial/archaeal populations, but could significantly affect both bacterial and archaeal community
structures, including syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens. These
results indicate that Na+, lipid and ammonia are among the key parameters that affect the process
performance of a thermophilic AD system treating FRW and/or the microbial communities in it.

1. Introduction
Food waste is one of the three largest components by weight
of the organic waste stream in Korea; 8.4 million tons of food
waste and wastewater (14.3% of total organic waste generation)
was generated in 2011 [1]. In Korea, food waste has been selectively collected among household wastes by law since 2003, and
> 95% is recycled as animal feed or compost. During the recycling
process, 3.4 million tons of food waste-recycling wastewater
(FRW, also referred to as food waste leachate or food wastewater)
have been generated annually, and constituted 41% of the total
annual food waste and wastewater generation in 2011 [1]. FRW
is a high-strength organic wastewater, that has 48–200 g chemical oxygen demand (COD)/L [2]. Due to the large quantity and the
high organic material content, significant environmental effects
are anticipated if FRW is released into the ecosystem without
adequate treatment.
Anaerobic digestion (AD) has been considered as a treatment
option that can reduce the quantity of organic waste, and simultaneously generate CH4, which can be used as a fuel. The Korean government has invested considerable money to install full-scale
anaerobic digesters in major cities in Korea to treat food waste
and/or FRW; at present, twenty full-scale AD plants are being
operated.
AD consists of four sequential biochemical processes: hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. Process
imbalance between acidogenesis and methanogenesis may occur
(i.e., the total concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) [TVFA]
produced by acidogens exceeds the amount of VFAs consumed
by methanogens) as a result of hydraulic or organic overloading,
the presence of compounds that inhibit anaerobes, or changes in
process conditions and influent substrate [3]. The content of major
organic components (i.e., carbohydrate, protein, and lipid) would
also affect the stability and efficiency of AD because they are
degraded into various metabolites via different biochemical pathways [4]. FRW is reported to contain high contents of lipid
(30.5 g/L; 37% of volatile solids (VS)), protein (24.6 g/L; 30% of
VS), and Na+ (2.1 g/L for FRW, 6.9 g/L for food waste), so
potentially-inhibitory compounds such as long chain fatty acids
(specified as lipid), ammonia, and Na+ could be primary concerns
in AD of FRW [2,5,6]. Furthermore, in a full-scale AD system, the
characteristics of the feedstock can vary unpredictably; such fluctuations may cause imbalance between acidogenesis and
methanogenesis, and can change the microbial community structure as well as process stability and performance [7,8]. In fact, substrate utilizations and inhibitory effects are correlated with growth
of specific microorganisms and to specific shifts in the microbial
communities during variations of process performance, but the
natures and degrees of these correlations remain unknown. In general, process functionality (and metabolic rate) is higher but microbial diversity is lower in thermophilic AD than in mesophilic AD, so
stable operation may be difficult to attain in thermophilic AD systems [9,10]. Thus, understanding of correlations within and among
process variables and microorganisms in a thermophilic AD system
would provide new insight into the interactions that affect the stability of the process.
Many studies have used high-throughput sequencing methods
to quantify microbial community structures in AD systems, but reference data for profiling of anaerobic microbial communities on
various types of organic waste are limited [11]. Moreover, variations of microbial communities in a full-scale thermophilic AD system treating FRW in the presence of variations in inhibitory effects
(e.g., by Na+ and lipid) have not been reported to the best of our
knowledge. Therefore, in this study, two-year variations (covering
four seasons) of microbial communities of a full-scale thermophilic
anaerobic digester treating FRW were analyzed using 454 pyrose-

quencing. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was conducted to
investigate temporal variation in microbial community structure
over this period. Correlations within and among process variables
and microbial communities in the AD system were determined
using correlation tests and visualized using redundancy analysis.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Full-scale anaerobic digester
A full-scale anaerobic digester (working volume 2200 m3) fed
with FRW in city of Gwangju, Korea was chosen for investigation
of microbial community structures. The digester is a thermophilic
(58.5 °C) continuously-stirred tank reactor (CSTR), and so it is
abbreviated as TC. Hydraulic retention time of the digester varied
from 15.5 d to 17.5 d.
2.2. Sampling and DNA extraction
The organic and inorganic composition of FRW varies widely
over seasons [2], so the effects of this variation may affect process
variables and microbial communities in the thermophilic AD system treating FRW. To consider its temporal variations, eight seasonal samples were collected from October, 2010 to July, 2012.
The samples were numbered chronologically: TC1 = Oct 2010;
TC2 = Jan 2011; TC3 = Apr 2011; TC4 = Jul 2011; TC5 = Oct 2011;
TC6 = Jan 2011; TC7 = Apr 2012; TC8 = Jul 2012). Samples were collected from the influent pipe and directly from the digester, and
stored in an ice box as soon as possible.
Total genomic DNA was extracted from the TC samples by using
an automated nucleic acid extractor (Magtration System 6GC, PSS,
Chiba, Japan). Before extraction of genomic DNA, 200 ll of sample
was centrifuged at 16 000 g for 10 min, and 100 ll of the supernatant was decanted. Then the pellet was washed twice in three
steps: (1) the pellet was added with 100 ll of deionized distilled
water and resuspended; (2) the suspension was centrifuged; (3)
100 ll of supernatant was decanted. Finally, the pellet was gently
suspended and applied to an automated nucleic acid extractor
(Magtration System 6GC, PSS Co., Japan). The pellets including
the extracted DNA were eluted with 100 ll of Tris–HCl buffer
(pH 8.0) and stored at 20 °C until further analyzed.
2.3. Physicochemical analysis
A gas chromatograph (6890 Plus, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) with
an HP Innowax capillary column and flame ionization detector
was used to measure VFAs and ethanol. The pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and VS concentrations were determined
according to the procedures in Standard Methods [12]. Carbohydrate concentration was measured using the phenol–sulfuric acid
method [13]. Protein concentration and total ammonia nitrogen
[ammonia] were determined using the Kjeldahl method [12].
Lipid concentrations [lipid] were measured by gravimetric analysis after extraction of lipid using chloroform: methanol (1:2 v/
v) [14]. Sodium ion concentration [Na+] and chloride ion concentration were measured using ion chromatography (790 Personal
IC, Metrohm, Switzerland). All analyses were performed in
duplicate.
2.3.1. Pyrosequencing analysis
Several fusion primers were designed under the guidance of
Macrogen (Seoul, Korea) and synthesized by Bioneer (Daejeon,
Korea). The fusion primers consisted of adapter A or B and the
oligonucleotide for amplifying the target sequence. The combined
primers A-787f (50 -ATTAG ATACC CNGGT AG-30 ) and B-1492r

J. Lee et al. / Chemical Engineering Journal 300 (2016) 291–299

(50 -GNTAC CTTGT TACGA CTT-30 ) were used to amplify the V5–V9
of 16S rRNA genes of extracted genomic DNA [15]. After an initial
denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, 30 cycles of polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) were performed (denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s,
annealing at 57 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 1 min), followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products were purified on 1% agarose gel by using a genomic DNA
purification kit (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea). All of the
454 pyrosequencing analyses were performed at Macrogen
(Seoul, Korea) following the manufacturer’s protocol (454 Life
Science, Branford, USA). An ‘‘in-house” program (Macrogen, Seoul,
Korea) was used to remove the adapter sequences from all amplified reads before further analysis. Reads with low nucleotidequality scores (< 20), short sequences (< 270-bp), and
potentially-chimeric sequences were discarded and MOTHUR
with CD-HIT-OTU was used to cluster the remaining sequences
that had P 97% sequence similarity as operational taxonomic
units (OTUs). Taxonomic classification of the OTUs was performed using the SILVA database. The nucleotide sequences
obtained from the 454 pyrosequencing were deposited in NCBI’s
sequence read archive (PRJNA315957).

2.4. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR)
(LightCycler 480, Roche) was used to quantify the populations
(16S rRNA gene copies) of total bacteria and total archaea in the
digester. TaqMan probe-primer sets were used: for bacteria,
BAC338F (50 -ACTCC TACGG GAGGC AG-30 ), BAC516F (50 -TGCCA
GCAGC CGCGG TAATA C-30 ), and BAC805R (50 -GACTA CCAGG
GTATC TAATC C-30 ); for archaea, ARC787F (50 -ATTAG ATACC CSBGT
AGTCC-30 ), ARC915F (50 -AGGAA TTGGC GGGGG AGCAC-30 ), and
ARC1059R (50 -GCCAT GCACC WCCTC T-30 ) [16].

2.5. Statistical analysis
Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) using Sorensen
(Bray–Curtis) distance was conducted to visualize how the similarity of microbial community structures in the digester changed
over time (PC-ORD 5.0, MjM software, OR, USA). Sorensen (Bray–
Curtis) distance is dominantly used for NMS of ecological community data because it provides better sensitivity in heterogeneous data sets and gives less weight to outliers than does
Euclidean distance [17]. Relative abundances of bacterial OTUs
or archaeal OTUs obtained by 454 pyrosequencing analysis were
used as the data sets. Process variables with p < 0.1 were selected
and used as the second matrix to construct a Joint NMS ordination plot. Each main matrix was processed for ordination such
that the stress (< 10) and the instability (< 104) criteria were
met [17].
Redundancy analysis (RDA) to visualize the correlations among
environmental variables and microbial community structures in
two-dimensional space was performed using CANOCO 4.5 (Plant
Research International, The Netherlands). In this study, the relative
abundances of bacterial genera from the 454 pyrosequencing analysis were used as dependent variables, and process variables
selected by forward selection (e.g., [lipid], [Na+], [TVFA], and [ammonia] in the digester; lipid removal, COD removal) were used as
independent variables. The statistical significance of the model
was tested by Monte Carlo permutation against 999 random datasets. Pearson correlation tests were conducted using R software
packages with optparse and gclus libraries to quantify correlation
coefficients within and among process variables and microbial
communities.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Variations in process performance along with changes in process
variables in a full-scale thermophilic AD system treating FRW
Temporal variation and effect of process variables on process
performance of the full-scale thermophilic AD system fed with
FRW were investigated using the eight seasonal samples. The
two-year averages of the FRW feedstock were 161.5 ±
27.3 g COD/L and 71.4 ± 14.7 g VS/L. Carbohydrate (24.7 ± 14.8 g/
L; 35% of VS), protein (24.3 ± 9.1 g/L; 34%) and lipid
(21.3 ± 4.0 g/L; 30%) contributed evenly to the organic contents
of the FRW (Fig. 1a). These values confirm that the characteristics
of the FRW used in this study agreed with the year-round observations as previously reported [2]. The coefficient of variation
(CV) was 60% for carbohydrate, 32% for lipid and 32% for protein.
These variations were higher than those of VS (21%) and COD
(17%); i.e., temporal variations in composition exceeded those
in total organic concentration. The high CV of carbohydrate content resulted mainly from relatively lower values of carbohydrate
contents in summer samples (17% of VS), TC4 and TC8, compared
to spring (29%), fall (34%), and winter (54%) samples. [TVFA] was
higher in the summer (19.0 g/L) than in other seasons (7.7–
10.9 g/L) (Fig. 1a). One possible explanation for these opposing
trend is that high temperature during summer may have
increased microbial acidification of carbohydrate during transport
and storage processes.
In this study, COD removal efficiency was considered a key
parameter in assessment of the process performance of the AD system. COD removal varied from 26% to 80% over time (Fig. 1b). More
carbohydrate (22.3 ± 15.3 g/L; 90% of influent) was degraded than
lipid (12.7 ± 5.1 g/L; 60% of influent) or protein (9.4 ± 5.6 g/L; 38%
of influent) in the system. Poor degradation of protein compared
to carbohydrate and lipid is often observed in full-scale anaerobic
digesters fed with FRW [18], and suggests that FRW may contain
high contents of refractory protein. Lipid removal increased as
COD removal increased (r = 0.907, p < 0.05), and was more similar
to the trend in variation with COD than were carbohydrate and
protein removal (Fig. 1); these results suggest that lipid removal
could be the main factor that determines COD removal in the TC
digester.
[Lipid], [Na+], and [ammonia] in the digester can directly
influence process performance and microbial communities in
an AD system [19]. [Lipid] varied more among samples
(CV = 89%), than did [Na+] (36%), or [ammonia] (23%) (Fig. 1c).
High [lipid] in the digester can inhibit microorganisms (1) by
limiting substrate transfer between the cell and the aqueous
phase, or (2) by disrupting cellular homeostasis [20,21]. Moreover, compared to mesophilic conditions, inhibition of lipids
(including long chain fatty acids) is more problematic under
thermophilic conditions due to the presence of higher portion
of their unionized forms [22]. In this study, [Lipid] in the digester increased as [lipid] in the influent FRW increased (r = 0.789,
p < 0.05); i.e., high [lipid] in the digester may be closely related
to high [lipid] in the influent FRW (Fig. 1c). COD removal
decreased as [lipid] in the digester increased (r = 0.889,
p < 0.05); this trend suggests that lipids may inhibit digestion
in the digester. For instance, COD removal remained above the
average (61%) when [lipid] in the digester was < 5.0 g/L, but
decreased drastically to 26–44% when it was > 5.0 g/L
(Fig. 1b and c). This trend is consistent with a previous study
that reported 5 g lipid/L as an inhibition threshold in AD of
protein- and lipid-rich organic wastes [23].
[Na+] can inhibit growth of microorganisms if it is high enough
to cause dehydration of cells by elevated osmotic pressure
[19,24,25]. The IC50 of sodium for methanogenic activity, assessed

on methanogens alone or together with syntrophic bacteria, varies
widely from 3 g/L to 16 g/L, mainly due to the differences in the
degree of acclimation of microbial communities and in the environmental conditions in the AD systems [19,25]. In this study,
[Na+] in the digester varied from 2.9 g/L to 7.7 g/L; [Na+] in the
digester was negatively correlated with COD removal (r = 0.908,
p < 0.05) (Fig. 1c). COD removal decreased significantly when
[Na+] in the digester reached 7.1–7.7 g/L (e.g., in TC1, TC3, and
TC4); this response is consistent with a previous report that thermophilic AD was severely inhibited by the presence of 7.8 g Na+/
L [26].
High [ammonia] can also inhibit methane production by
inhibiting methanogens and bacteria; reported IC50 of ammonia
for methane production is 1.7 6 [ammonia] 6 14 g/L, depending
on inoculum and the environmental conditions in the AD system
[19,27]. Neither [ammonia] nor [free ammonia] showed significant
correlation with any organic removals in this study; i.e., the ranges
of [ammonia] and [free ammonia] in the digester (2.0–4.3 g N/L
and 0.1–2.0 g N/L, respectively) might not have significantly
affected the entire process performance during the two-year operation (Fig. 1c).
VFAs can accumulate when: (1) the influent loading or characteristics are high or vary widely, so that methanogens cannot
completely process the VFAs generated by bacteria, (2) compounds (including Na+, lipid, ammonia and increased VFAs
themselves) that inhibit methanogens occur in the digester
[3,19]. COD removal decreased as [TVFA] and concentrations of
acetate and butyrate increased (r = 0.776, 0.690, 0.833,
respectively, all p < 0.1) (Fig. 1d); these results are consistent
with previous reports that suggest that the concentrations of
VFAs in the digester can be used as an indicator of process
instability [3].

3.2. QPCR analysis of total microbial populations
To investigate the relationship between variations in microbial
population and the perturbations in [Na+] and [lipid], total bacterial and archaeal populations of the eight seasonal samples were
quantified using QPCR. The total population of bacteria was
1.4  1010 ± 1.5  1010 rRNA gene copies/mL, and the total population of archaea was 9.1  107 ± 1.1  108 16S rRNA gene copies/mL
(Supplementary Fig. 1), and both were positively correlated with
variation in COD removal (r = 0.782, p < 0.05 and r = 0.664,
p < 0.1, respectively) but negatively correlated with [Na+] and
[lipid] in the digester (Supplementary Fig. 1); the second of these
results suggests that high [Na+] and [lipid] inhibited the growth
of both bacteria and archaea, and reduced overall process
performance.
3.2.1. Pyrosequencing analysis of microbial population profile in total
454 pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons from
eight samples resulted in 58 342 non-chimeric sequence reads.
Reads that shared P 97% similarity in sequences were grouped
as OTUs; after this preprocess, 17 073 reads (2 134 ± 783 reads for
each sample) remained as rigid reads and were grouped into
116 OTUs for further analysis. In this study, the ratio R of classified
reads to total bacterial reads decreased as taxonomic levels of
methanogens moved from the phylum to the species. R was 1.00
at the phylum level, 0.83 at the class level, 0.82 at the order level,
0.80 at the family level, and 0.77 at the genus level, but only 0.20 at
the species level. Because R decreased significantly between phylum and class, and between genus and species, further analysis
focused on the phylum and the genus.
All of the bacterial reads (17 073 reads) were classified into one
of nine phyla: Firmicutes (66.6 ± 20.1%), Synergistetes

J. Lee et al. / Chemical Engineering Journal 300 (2016) 291–299

(19.1 ± 18.6%),
Thermotogae
(10.4 ± 8.9%),
Bacteroidetes
(2.2 ± 3.5%), Atribacteria (1.1 ± 2.0%), Proteobacteria (0.4 ± 0.6%),
Tenericutes (0.2 ± 0.5%), Actinobacteria (0.006 ± 0.018%), Spirochaetes (0.004 ± 0.011%) (Supplementary Fig. 2). The overwhelming dominance of Firmicutes has been commonly reported in labscale [28] and full-scale thermophilic anaerobic digesters [29]. In
this study, of 116 OTUs (i.e., total number of bacterial OTUs found
in this study), 90 (78%) were classified into Firmicutes and a large
portion of unclassified reads at the class level (92%) belonged to
Firmicutes. This result indicates that Firmicutes was highly diverse
and contributed significantly to the decrease in R between the phylum and class levels. Phylum Atribacteria (8% of total unclassified
reads at the class level) has no cultivated representatives, and is
only found in cultivation-independent genomic analyses such as
metagenomic analyses [30]. Reconstruction of genomic information of Atribacteria genotypes suggests that these bacteria can ferment carbohydrate and organic acids to ethanol, acetate, and
hydrogen.
Results of various previous metagenomic studies of anaerobes
have suggested correlations between process variables (i.e., environmental variables) or process performance and bacteria at the
phylum level [8,29,31]. One report demonstrated that the types
and compositions of substrates fed to the AD systems determined
the ratio RFB of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (e.g., high RFB for easilydegradable substrates, low RFB for fibrous substrate) [31]. In this
study, RFB showed no such a relationship with composition of the
substrate fed to the TC digester. In fact, investigation of the correlation between process variables and bacteria communities of AD
systems may be inadequate if it is based solely on bacterial data

295

at the phylum level. This is because bacteria vary greatly in both
phenotype and genotype even if they belong to the same phylum;
thus, these correlations should be conducted at the finest taxonomic level possible (i.e., genus or species).
At the genus level, 13 218 reads (77.4% of the total bacterial
reads) were classified into 45 genera. Sixteen bacterial genera that
showed relative abundance > 0.5% in one of the eight samples were
considered high-rank groups: Tepidanaerobacter (20.6 ± 15.1%),
Anaerobaculum (19.1 ± 18.6%), Defluviitoga (10.4 ± 8.9%), Keratinibaculum
(8.1 ± 8.3%),
Gelria
(7.9 ± 8.2%),
Tepidimicrobium
(3.4 ± 5.0%), Caldicoprobacter (2.5 ± 1.2%), Bacillus (1.8 ± 4.4%), Syntrophaceticus (1.7 ± 2.8%), Ruminiclostridium (0.6 ± 1.1%), Lactobacillus (0.4 ± 0.6%), Halocella (0.3 ± 0.3%), Proteiniphilum (0.3 ± 0.6%),
Methyloversatilis (0.2 ± 0.3%), Syntrophomonas (0.2 ± 0.2%), Haloplasma (0.1 ± 0.3%) (Fig 2a). Among these sixteen genera, Tepidanaerobacter, Anaerobaculum, Defluviitoga, Keratinibaculum,
Gelria, Tepidimicrobium, Caldicoprobacter, Bacillus, and Syntrophaceticus were dominant (96% of the average abundance of
classified bacterial genera and each contributing P 1.0% on average) (Fig. 2a).
454 pyrosequencing of the eight samples yielded 8 130 nonchimeric archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequence reads; 3 822
(478 ± 642 reads per sample) remained as rigid reads and were
grouped into nine OTUs for further analysis. All (3 822) of the
archaeal reads were classified into seven methanogen genera:
Methanoculleus (63.7 ± 44.4%), Methanobacterium (30.7 ± 40.2%),
Methanolinea (2.2 ± 4.2%), Methanothermobacter (1.6 ± 4.4%),
Methanospirillum (0.9 ± 2.2%), Methanogenium (0.9 ± 2.2%), and
Methanosaeta (0.1 ± 0.2%) (Fig. 2b). Hydrogenotrophic methano-

gens (HMs) constituted 99.9% of total archaeal reads. The dominance of HMs is generally observed in AD systems that are
ammonia-stressed (> 3 g N/L) due to presence of selective inhibition on aceticlastic methanogens [27]. High [ammonia] in the TC
digester (3.3 ± 0.8 g N/L on average) supports this trend. At the
genus level, taxonomic resolution was much lower for bacteria
(19.6%) than for archaea (100%); the difference may occur because
bacteria are more diverse than archaea, so that 16S rRNA based
analysis of bacteria is likely to be more vulnerable to limitations
in short-read length of 16S rRNA amplicons in 454 pyrosequencing
and incomplete 16S rRNA gene databases [32].
3.3. Variations in microbial community structures
NMS was conducted to visualize the similarity of microbial
community structure based on the relative abundances of OTUs
across the sample set in the full-scale thermophilic AD system
treating FRW (Fig. 3). The Joint NMS result for bacteria indicated
that bacterial community structure dynamically shifted over time,
and that all temporal shifts were in different directions; the lack of
consistent change suggests that bacterial community structure
was influenced more by environmental variations in the digester
than by temporal variations (Fig. 3a). [Lipid], [Na+], [TVFA], and
[ammonia] in the digester and COD removal had significant effects
(p < 0.1) on in bacterial community structures among the samples.
The samples located in the upper half of the NMS (TC1, TC3, TC4)
had high [lipid], [Na+], and [TVFA] in the digester and low COD
removals compared to the other samples; this result indicates that
community structure varied in response to [lipid], [Na+], and
[TVFA] in the digester and to COD removal. The vector to [ammonia] in the digester was at 90° to the vectors to [lipid] and [Na+] in
the digester; this means that the effects of [ammonia] are independent of those of [lipid], [Na+]. [TVFA] in the digester showed positive correlation with [lipid] and [Na+], and negative correlation
with COD removal; this result agrees well with previous study that
suggested that high VFA concentrations in the digester may indicate process instability and inhibition of the AD system [3].
In the Joint NMS ordination plot based on archaeal OTUs, significant shifts of methanogen community structure occurred three
times: TC1 to TC2, TC6 to TC7, and TC7 to TC8 (Fig. 3b). The shifts
are mainly explained by shifts of dominant methanogen from
Methanoculleus to Methanobacterium (i.e., a negative correlation

between these most-abundant genera, r = 0.971, p < 0.05)
(Fig. 2b). [Ammonia] in the digester was a significant process variable (p < 0.1) among process variables to explain variations in
archaeal community structures among the samples (Fig. 3b). The
vector to [ammonia] in the digester points up axis 2; this orientation suggests that [ammonia] could have a significant effect on the
significant shifts of archaeal community structures. The opposite
correlations of Methanobacterium and Methanoculleus with [ammonia] (r = 0.829, p < 0.05 and r = 0.874, p < 0.05, respectively) supported this hypothesis.
In this study, [lipid], [Na+], and [TVFA] in the digester (3.3–
22.8 g lipid/L, 2.9–7.7 g Na+/L, 6.7–44.6 g TVFA/L) were important
process variables that could affect both total bacterial population
(i.e., bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies/L) and bacterial community
structure (i.e., relative compositions of bacteria OTUs). They
seemed also to influence variations in total archaeal population,
but not archaeal community structure. In contrast, [ammonia] in
the digester (2.0–4.3 g N/L; 0.1–2.0 g free ammonia N/L) was the
only factor that affected the shifts of archaeal community structures, but it had no significant correlation with COD removal and
total bacterial population.
These observations suggest that if specific microorganisms are
suppressed by increasing [ammonia], their functions might be
replaced by other microorganisms with similar roles without
major reduction in overall process performance in this thermophilic AD system, at least within the given ranges of [ammonia].
Furthermore, the fact that [ammonia] had similar effects on bacterial and archaeal community structures implies that perturbing
[ammonia] could cause critical changes in syntrophic consortia
(of bacteria and archaea) that perform methanogenesis in the TC
digester. This speculation is supported by the results that [ammonia] in the digester was positively correlated with relative abundances of Tepidanaerobacter (a genus that includes syntrophic
acetate-oxidizing bacteria, and that comprised 20.6 ± 15.1% of total
bacteria; r = 0.657, p < 0.1) and of Methanobacterium (an HM genus
that comprised 30.7 ± 40.2% of total archaea; r = 0.829, p < 0.05).

seasonal variations in the thermophilic AD system (Fig. 4). The correlations were double-checked using Pearson’s correlation coefficient at 90% and 95% confidence intervals (Supplementary
Table 1). The RDA ordination plot (Fig. 4) had model p < 0.05, which
means that the model was statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval, and eigenvalue = 0.55, which means that the independent variables explained 55% of the variance in the response
variables.
The genera Tepidanaerobacter and Syntrophaceticus include syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB) such as Tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans and Syntrophaceticus schinkii, which establish
syntrophic relationships with HMs [33,34]. T. acetatoxydans was
detected in this study; this species can grow in co-culture with
HMs including Methanoculleus sp. and Methanobacterium sp., which
were dominant methanogens in the TC digester [33,35]. In this
study, the facts that (1) HMs constitute 99.9% in total methanogens, (2) Tepidanaerobacter was the most abundant bacteria genus,
and (3) the average abundance of Tepidanaerobacter was twelve
times higher than that of Syntrophaceticus, suggest that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis coupled with T. acetatoxydans could be the
main metabolic pathway to generate methane by acetate degradation in the TC digester. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Tepidanaerobacter increased as [ammonia] increased (r = 0.657,
p < 0.1) (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 1); i.e., Tepidanaerobacter
was not inhibited by [ammonia] within the range of 2.0–4.3 g N/
L (0.1–2.0 g free ammonia N/L) in the TC digester. This conclusion
is consistent with the previous report that T. acetatoxydans could
grow at 0–7 g N/L; whereas Thermacetogenium phaeum, another
common thermophilic SAOB, could grow at 0–3 g N/L [35].
Although the genus Syntrophaceticus can also grow at high [ammonia] = 6.4 g N/L, it grows optimally in mesophilic conditions (25–
45 °C), so it was uncommon in the TC digester [34]. The relative
abundance of Tepidanaerobacter was correlated positively with
the relative abundance of Methanobacterium (r = 0.598) and negatively with the relative abundance of Methanoculleus (r = 0.713,
p < 0.05); these opposite relationships suggest that Methanobacterium might be a preferred syntrophic partner in methanogenesis
under the ammonia-stressed condition in the TC digester.

underlined. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the

Anaerobaculum (19.1%) was the second most-dominant genus,
and could significantly contribute to carbohydrate removal
(r = 0.692, p < 0.1) in the TC digester (Supplementary Table 1). This
conclusion is consistent with literature reports that Anaerobaculum
hydrogeniformans ferments mainly sugars to acetate, hydrogen and
carbon dioxide, possibly in syntrophy with HMs [36]. Anaerobaculum was abnormally dominant at TC4 (60.8%) when NaCl concentration was the highest (10.7 g/L) among the samples (Fig. 2a),
this response is consistent with the observation that A. hydrogeniformans requires high NaCl concentration (10 g/L) for optimum
growth.
Defluviitoga (10.4%) was the third dominant genus. It consists of
one known species, Defluviitoga tunisiensis, a thermophilic (55 °C as
the optimum), slightly halophilic (5 g NaCl/L as the optimum)
sulfur-reducing bacterium isolated from a whey digester [37]. This
bacterium can degrade a variety of sugars to acetate, H2, and CO2.
Previous studies reported that the genus Defluviitoga was the most
dominant bacterium in thermophilic AD systems fed with proteinrich wastes such as stillage [38] or food waste [9], but the exact
roles of this bacteria in those systems were not determined. Both
wastes included high protein content, so the positive correlation
between protein removal and the relative abundance of Defluviitoga (r = 0.685, p < 0.1) in the TC digester (Supplementary Table 1)
may not be coincidental.
Keratinibaculum (8.1%) was the fourth dominant genus; it
includes one known species, Keratinibaculum paraultunense, a thermophilic (55 °C as the optimum), slightly halophilic (2 g NaCl/L as
the optimum) bacterium that uses keratins and other proteins [39].
To our knowledge, this is the first detection of Keratinibaculum as a
dominant bacterium in an AD system; however, the relative abundance of this genus was not significantly correlated with any of the
process variables considered in this study.
Gelria (7.9%) was the fifth dominant genus. It includes one
known species, Gelria glutamica, which was isolated from a
propionate-oxidizing methanogenic enrichment culture [40]. G.
glutamica is reported to ferment glutamate in syntrophic relationship with Methanobacterium sp., and can solely oxidize sugars to
acetate, propionate, H2 and CO2 under thermophilic conditions.
The relative abundances of Gelria and Syntrophomonas were correlated negatively with [Na+] and [lipid], but positively with COD
removal and lipid removal (Fig. 4). This suggested that these genera may make critical contribution to lipid or COD removals, but
are drastically inhibited by the [Na+] and [lipid] ranges in the TC
digester (Fig. 1). Inhibition of Gelria and Syntrophomonas by [Na+]
and [lipid] has not been reported previously, so the contributions
of these genera to COD removal or lipid removal were investigated.
Gelria could contribute to COD removal by degrading glutamate in
syntrophic relationship with HMs. Previous research also supports
the significance contribution of Gelria to production of H2, which
may then be utilized by HMs, in a thermophilic AD system to
degrade cellulose and microbial protein [41]. Thus, Gelria sp. may
be an indicator of process performance in thermophilic AD systems
that treat food waste or food wastewater. Syntrophomonas consists
of species known to oxidize long chain fatty acids (i.e., lipid) in syntrophic relationship with methanogens [42]; this relationship is
consistent with the positive correlation between lipid removal
and the relative abundance of this genus.
Caldicoprobacter (2.5%) was the only genus in which the relative
abundance was positively correlated with [Na+] in the digester
(r = 0.939, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 1); i.e., Caldicoprobacter may be halophilic or halotolerant at least within the
ranges of 2.9–7.7 Na+ g/L, and this is consistent with the characteristics of C. faecale (recently reclassified from Acetomicrobium faecale), which is halotolerant (< 50 g NaCl/L) [43]. Moreover, the
relative abundance of Caldicoprobacter was negatively correlated
with COD removal (r = 0.918, p < 0.05), so they may indicate abnor-

mality of process performance in thermophilic AD systems treating
food waste or food wastewater.
Tepidimicrobium (3.4%) showed the highest positive correlation
with [TVFA] in the digester (r = 0.901, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 1). This relationship is consistent with reports that all
species in this genus are acidogens that produce VFAs under thermophilic conditions [44]. A positive correlation of the relative
abundance of Tepidimicrobium with [TVFA] in the digester has been
noted previously, and the presence of this genus is considered an
indicator of process acidification [45].
Among the dominant genera, Tepidanaerobacter, Anaerobaculum, Defluviitoga, Ketarinibaculum, and Tepidimicrobium had no significant correlation with [Na+] or [lipid] in the digester (Fig. 4;
Supplementary Table 1); therefore variations of [Na+] or [lipid]
within the given ranges might do not seem to affect the relative
abundances of those genera in bacterial community structures in
the TC digester. However, [ammonia] was a possible factor to
explain variations in these genera: as [ammonia] increased, relative abundances of Tepidanaerobacter, Tepidimicrobium, and Defluviitoga increased, whereas relative abundances of Anaerobaculum
and Keratinibaculum decreased (Fig. 4).
Bacterial and archaeal diversity indices were separately quantified based on rigid OTUs (P 0.5% relative abundance in one of eight
samples). In an ecosystem, species richness S represents the number of species present; and evenness E represents their relative
abundances. The Shannon diversity index H, which considers both
S and E, is generally used to quantify species diversity of various
ecosystems [9,46,47].
For bacteria, [lipid] in the digester correlated negatively with S,
E, and H; i.e., inhibition due to high [lipid] decreased overall bacterial diversity (Table 1). Removals of COD, VS, carbohydrate, and
lipid positively correlated with H; these trends indicate that
increasing the diversity of the bacterial community could stabilize
and increase process performance of the AD system. All of these
results are consistent with previous studies and the general concept in ecology that a high diversity of microorganisms increases
the functionality of an ecosystem [9,48].
For archaea, [TVFA] in the digester was positively correlated
with H; this relationship indicates that process instability could
occur as archaeal diversity increased. This conclusion concurs with
a previous report that methanogen diversity increases in the presence of inhibitory effects [49]. It also indicates that bacteria and
archaea could have different diversity responses, but not different
population size responses, to inhibitory effects in AD systems.

variables were elucidated using biomolecular tools (i.e., QPCR
and 454 pyrosequencing) and statistical computations (i.e., NMS,
RDA and Pearson correlation test). Eight seasonal observations of
two-year operation of the digester gave statistically meaningful
results as follows.

(1) Temporal variation of organic composition in the FRW was
high; high [lipid] in the digester may result from high [lipid]
in the influent FRW. [Na+] and [lipid] in the digester was
negatively correlated with COD removal of the AD system,
but [ammonia] was not.
(2) Tepidanaerobacter, Anaerobaculum, and Defluviitoga, Keratinibaculum, Gelria, Tepidimicrobium, Caldicoprobacter, Bacillus,
and Syntrophaceticus were dominant bacterial genera, and
Methanoculleus and Methanobacterium were dominant
archaeal genera.
(3) Both total bacterial and archaeal populations were positively
correlated with COD removal but negatively correlated with
[Na+] and [lipid] in the digester. This result suggests that
high [Na+] and [lipid] within the ranges might inhibit the
growth of both bacteria and archaea, and reduce COD
removal of the AD system.
(4) The bacterial community structure could be significantly
affected by [Na+], [lipid] and [ammonia] in the digester. Gelria and Cardiocoprobacter showed opposite responses to
[Na+] and [lipid] in the digester, and may be microbial indicators of process abnormality in thermophilic CSTR AD systems that treat FRW. [Ammonia] in the digester could solely
affect both bacterial and archaeal community structures,
especially in the dominance and the variations in SAOB
(i.e., Tepidanaerobacter) and HMs (i.e., Methanoculleus,
Methanobacterium) genera, which were explained by variation in [ammonia].
(5) Bacterial diversity was negatively correlated with [lipid].
Archaeal diversity was positively correlated with [TVFA].
To summarize, high [Na+] > 7 g Na+/L and high [lipid] > 5 g lipid/
L might result in decrease of overall bacteria and archaeal functionalities in the thermophilic AD system; in turn, this repression
would reduce COD removal. Moreover, [Na+], [lipid], and [ammonia]
were among the key parameters that determine process performance and/or the underpinning microbial communities for
thermophilic AD system treating high-strength and complex
organic wastewater.

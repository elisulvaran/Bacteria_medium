A novel anaerobic, Gram-positive, thermophilic, spore-forming, obligately
syntrophic, glutamate-degrading bacterium, strain TGOT, was isolated from a
propionate-oxidizing methanogenic enrichment culture. The axenic culture was
obtained by growing the bacterium on pyruvate. Cells were rod-shaped and
non-motile. The optimal temperature for growth was 50–55 SC and growth
occurred between 37 and 60 SC. The pH range for growth was 55–8 with
optimum growth at pH 7. In pure culture, strain TGOT could grow on pyruvate,
lactate, glycerol and several sugars. In co-culture with the hydrogenotrophic
methanogen Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum strain Z-245, strain TGOT
could grow on glutamate, proline and Casamino acids. Glutamate was
converted to H2, CO2, propionate and traces of succinate. Strain TGOT was not
able to utilize sulphate, sulphite, thiosulphate, nitrate or fumarate as electron
acceptors. The GMC content was 338 mol %. Sequence analysis of the 16S rDNA
revealed that strain TGOT belongs to the thermophilic, endospore-forming
anaerobes, though no close relations were found. Its closest relations were
Moorella glycerini (92 %) and Moorella thermoacetica (90 %). Strain TGOT had
an unusually long 16S rDNA of more than 1700 bp. The additional base pairs
were found as long loops in the V1, V7 and V9 regions of the 16S rDNA.
However, the loops were not found in the 16S rRNA. The name Gelria glutamica
gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed for strain TGOT.

INTRODUCTION

Because proteins are encountered in almost every
ecosystem, the biodegradation of amino acids is a very
important microbial process. The conversion of amino
acids in methanogenic environments has been studied
over the last 20 years, especially in temperate environments (Barker, 1981 ; Nagase & Matsuo, 1982 ;
McInerney, 1989). However, in moderately thermophilic methanogenic environments, the degradation of
amino acids has not been studied in detail. Only a few
bacterial species have been described to degrade amino
acids under thermophilic conditions (Cheng et al.,
.................................................................................................................................................

The GenBank accession number for the 16S rDNA sequence of strain TGOT
is AF321086.

1992 ; O= rlygsson, 1994 ; Tarlera et al., 1997 ; Plugge et
al., 2000).
Glutamate conversion under methanogenic conditions
can occur in different ways (Table 1). The formation of
acetate and butyrate as the organic end-products has
been described for many anaerobes that belong mainly
to the genus Clostridium. This type of conversion of
glutamate is hydrogen independent. Other examples of
hydrogen-independent glutamate conversions are the
homoacetogenic fermentation (Dehning et al., 1989)
and the reductive formation of propionate (Nanninga
et al., 1987). The formation of hydrogen is more likely
to occur in methanogenic environments, where hydrogen-scavenging methanogens convert the hydrogen to
methane with the concomitant reduction of CO . In

the presence of methanogens, the free energy available
from the overall reactions is higher (Table 1). Under

standard conditions, these reactions yield small
amounts of energy. In particular, the exclusive formation of propionate from glutamate is very difficult,
since the free energy at 55 mC is only k16n0 kJ (mol
glutamate)−" (Table 1). It is highly unlikely that a
single organism can perform this reaction. However, in
a methanogenic consortium, the hydrogen formed is
consumed via interspecies hydrogen transfer and the
energy that becomes available from this reaction
increases to k79n0 kJ (mol glutamate)−".
Earlier research indicated the presence of a propionateforming, obligately syntrophic bacterium in a thermophilic, syntrophic, glutamate-degrading, propionateoxidizing enrichment (Stams et al., 1992). From this
mixed culture, we isolated a bacterium that produced
propionate as the major product from glutamate, in
addition to traces of succinate. In this paper, we
present detailed information about the organism and
we propose to name the organism Gelria glutamica
gen. nov., sp. nov.
METHODS
Strains and source of organisms. The glutamate-degrading
strain TGOT was isolated from a thermophilic, syntrophic,
propionate-oxidizing enrichment culture as described by
Stams et al. (1992). Strain TPO, a syntrophic, propionateoxidizing bacterium, was isolated from the same enrichment
culture. Moorella thermoacetica DSM 521T and Moorella
glycerini DSM 11254T were obtained from the DSMZ. Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245 (l DSM 3720) has
been used before ; this methanogen was recently renamed
Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus Z-245 (Wasserfallen et al., 2000).

# of 182 kPa H \CO (80 : 20, v\v) was used and,
gas
# was# changed to N \CO . Organic
after growth, the gas phase
substrates were added from anaerobic sterile#stock#solutions
to final concentrations of 20 mM (unless otherwise stated).
To obtain an axenic culture, soft agar (0n7–0n8 % agar noble ;
Difco) was added to the medium described above, supplemented with 20 mM pyruvate as the carbon source. Light
microscopy confirmed purity.
For the reconstitution experiments with axenic cultures of
strain TGOT (0n5 %, v\v), strain TPO (2 %, v\v) and
Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245 (2 %, v\v)
were inoculated in medium with 20 mM glutamate.
Temperature and pH. The temperature optimum was
determined in bicarbonate-buffered medium containing
20 mM pyruvate at pH 7 and duplicate bottles were incubated at temperatures ranging from 30 to 75 mC. The pH
optimum was tested in medium by adding 0n15 g KH PO l−"

instead of sodium bicarbonate. The pH value of the medium
containing 20 mM pyruvate was adjusted with NaOH or
HCl under the N atmosphere. Duplicate bottles were
# pH values ranging from 4n5 to 9n5. For
incubated at 55 mC at
determinations of the temperature and pH optimum, OD
'!!
and acetate production were measured as indicators for
growth.
Growth and substrate utilization. Utilization of substrates
by strain TGOT in pure culture and in co-culture with
Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245 was determined by monitoring growth and substrate depletion as well
as product formation. All incubations were performed at
55 mC, pH 7. The effect of electron acceptors on the growth
of strain TGOT was tested in medium with 20 mM glutamate.
GjC content. Isolation and purification of genomic DNA
was carried out according to Marmur (1961). The GjC
content of the DNA was analysed using thermal denaturation as described by Owen et al. (1969).
16S rDNA sequence analysis. Total DNA was extracted from
strain TGOT as described previously (Zoetendal et al., 1998).
PCR was performed with the bacterial primers 7f and 1510r
(Lane, 1991) by using the Taq DNA polymerase kit (Life
Technologies) to amplify the bacterial 16S rDNA. PCR
products were purified with the Qiaquick PCR purification
kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

used as sequencing primers. The sequences were analysed
automatically on a LI-COR DNA sequencer 4000L and
corrected manually. Phylogenetic analysis and tree construction were performed with the programs of the 
software package (Strunk & Ludwig, 1991).  homology
searches with sequences of the EMBL and GenBank DNA
databases were performed and the results were compared
with those obtained with the  programs. Because strain
TGOT had additional loops in several regions of the 16S
rDNA, we did the database comparison with the complete
sequence of 1725 bp and also with the sequence without the
additional loops.
RNA isolation, RT–PCR and dot-blot hybridizations. RNA
was extracted from strain TGOT as described by Zoetendal
et al. (1998). Specific probes targeting the V1, V7 and V9
regions of the 16S rDNA of strain TGOT were applied
in order to investigate whether such additional loops were
also present in the 16S rRNA. The sequences of these oligonucleotides were 5h-GCTCTTGGGCCTTTTGAA-3h (V1
region), 5h-GTTAACCCTCTGGCTTTG-3h (V7 region)
and 5h-CTCAATCCGCAAGTTTAA-3h (V9 region).
Primer 538r (Lane, 1991) was used as a positive control for
Eubacteria. Dot-blot hybridizations were performed with
strain TGOT, Moorella thermoacetica, Moorella glycerini
and Escherichia coli as described by Oude Elferink et al.
(1997). All membranes were hybridized overnight at 40 mC.
RT–PCR of the 16S rRNA genes of strain TGOT, Moorella
thermoacetica, Moorella glycerini and Escherichia coli was
performed by means of bacterial primers 7f and 1510r using
the Access RT–PCR system (Promega). Prior to the RT–
PCR amplification, the samples were incubated with RNasefree DNase (Promega) to remove all traces of DNA. The
integrity and size of the nucleic acids were determined
visually after electrophoresis on a 1n2 % agarose gel containing ethidium bromide in the presence of markers and
compared with the 16S rDNA of strain TGOT.
Other methods. Gases and organic acids were analysed by
GC and HPLC as described by Plugge et al. (2000). Amino
acids were analysed by HPLC as described by Kengen &
Stams (1994). Occasionally, glutamate was determined
enzymically with glutamate dehydrogenase as described by
Bernt & Bergmeyer (1974). Ammonium was analysed by the
indophenol-blue method (Hanson & Philips, 1981). Inorganic compounds tested as electron acceptors were analysed by HPLC as described by Scholten & Stams (1995).
Gram and flagella staining were done by standard procedures as described previously (Plugge et al., 2000).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Isolation of the glutamate-oxidizing strain TGOT

A thermophilic, syntrophic, propionate-oxidizing enrichment, as described by Stams et al. (1992), was also
able to convert glutamate to acetate, NH+, HCO− and
$ on
CH . When the enrichment culture was% growing
%
glutamate, a small, rod-shaped bacterium became
predominant. It was not possible to obtain the bacterium in pure culture by adding an inhibitor of
methanogenesis (bromoethanesulphonic acid, BES) to
the enrichment culture. No degradation of glutamate
was observed when BES was added. The bacterium
could be purified by serial dilution in media containing
agar (0n7–0n8 %) with pyruvate as the organic substrate. The colonies that appeared in the agar and on

the surface of the agar were 0n7–1n0 mm in diameter.
The colonies were white and round at the surface and
lens-shaped in the agar. A single colony picked from
the agar grew in medium containing pyruvate and with
0n05 % yeast extract. Repeated transfer from liquid
medium to soft-agar medium resulted in an axenic
culture of a strain designated TGOT. This strain was
characterized further.
Morphology and cellular characterization

The isolated strain TGOT is a rod-shaped, sporeforming organism. The Gram stain was positive. Cells
were 0n5 µm in diameter and 1–1n5 µm in length when
grown on pyruvate (Fig. 1). If the bacterium was
grown on glucose, the cells were 0n5 µm in diameter
and 3–20 µm in length. Spores were located terminally
and were 0n5i0n5 µm in size and developed in the lateexponential phase. Motility was never observed, nor
were flagella found.
Physiological characterization

Strain TGOT was able to grow on glutamate only
in the presence of the methanogenic archaeon Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245. Glutamate
(15 mM) was converted to propionate (12n9 mM),
succinate (1n0 mM), NH+ (14n9 mM) and CH (8n9
% remM). The carbon and %electron recovery were
spectively 93 and 98 % (excluding the biomass formed).
The doubling time of strain TGOT in co-culture with
Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245 on glutamate was 0n23 day−". Several thermophilic bacteria
are known to utilize glutamate with the concomitant
production of H , but these organisms also grow in
pure culture on #glutamate. Caloramator proteoclasticus, Caloramator coolhaasii and Thermanaerovibrio
acidaminovorans (Cheng et al., 1992 ; Tarlera & Stams,
1999 ; Plugge et al., 2000) are examples of such
thermophilic glutamate-degrading organisms. In pure

vorans is grown in co-culture with a methanogen, the
products formed from glutamate conversion shift in
favour of propionate formation. However, considerable amounts of acetate are still formed. Examples of
mesophilic glutamate-degrading organisms that show
the same degradation products as Thermanaerovibrio
acidaminovorans are Acidaminobacter hydrogenoformans and Aminobacterium mobile (Stams & Hansen,
1984 ; Baena et al., 2000). Like strain TGOT, Aminobacterium mobile only grows on glutamate in the
presence of a hydrogen scavenger.

Strain TGOT is the first example of an organism that is
unable to form acetate from glutamate and forms
mainly propionate. As a consequence, the organism
has to grow in a syntrophic co-culture with a methanogen, since the free energy under standard conditions is
only slightly negative (Table 1). It is unclear why strain
TGOT does not form acetate from glutamate, even
though acetate production could be detected after
growth on several sugars, lactate and pyruvate. The
formation of traces of succinate during glutamate
utilization suggests that direct oxidation takes place
via α-ketoglutarate and succinyl-CoA. This pathway was also suggested to be used in propionate
formation in Thermanaerovibrio acidaminovorans and
Acidaminobacter hydrogenoformans (Cheng et al.,
1992 ; Stams & Hansen, 1984).
Yeast extract (minimum 0n02 %) was required for
growth. Pyruvate was converted by strain TGOT to
acetate, propionate, succinate (traces), H and CO .

Other substrates that could be used by the pure culture
of TGOT were lactate, arabinose, fructose, galactose,
glucose, maltose, mannitol, rhamnose and sucrose.
Sugars were converted mainly to acetate and propionate with the formation of traces of hydrogen and
formate.
In co-culture with the methanogen Methanobacterium
thermautotrophicum Z-245, strain TGOT could also
grow on Casamino acids, α-ketoglutarate and proline.
Proline (18n6 mM) was degraded to propionate (17n3
mM), NH+ (18n2 mM) and H (27n2 mM) and the
# calculated from the
amount of %hydrogen formed was
amount of methane measured. Anaerobic proline
oxidation has been reported for two other bacteria.
Desulfobacterium vacuolatum (Rees et al., 1998), a
versatile amino acid-utilizing sulphate reducer, and
Geovibrio ferrireducens (Caccavo et al., 1996), an ironreducing bacterium, can couple the oxidation of
proline to sulphate reduction and dissimilatory Fe(III)
reduction, respectively. The study of fermentative
proline utilization by anaerobes has focussed on its
use as an electron acceptor (McInerney, 1989). Strain
TGOT might be able to convert proline to glutamate
with the reverse reactions of proline synthesis via
glutamate semialdehyde.

Reconstitution of the original consortium from
axenic cultures of strain TGOT, strain TPO and
Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245

In order to investigate glutamate utilization as originally observed in the propionate-oxidizing enrichment
culture, we performed reconstitution experiments with
three axenic cultures : strain TGOT, strain TPO (the
syntrophic propionate-oxidizing organism) and Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum Z-245. In the original enrichment culture, glutamate was degraded to
acetate, CH , NH+ and CO , with the intermediate

In the reconstitution experiments, glutamate was

cultures.

Phylogeny

The nucleotide sequence (1725 bp) of the 16S rDNA of
strain TGOT was analysed and it revealed that this
organism belongs to the subphylum of Gram-positive,
endospore-forming, thermophilic, anaerobic bacteria.
Sequence alignment revealed that strain TGOT had
additional loops in the V1, V7 and V9 helices of the
16S rDNA. There are examples of other organisms
with 16S rDNA that exceeds the mean length of
1500 bp. In thermophiles, it is not unusual that the 16S
rDNA is longer (Rainey et al., 1996). Dot-blot hybridizations with specific oligonucleotides against these
regions showed no hybridization with 16S rRNA from
strain TGOT, Moorella glycerini, Moorella thermoacetica and Escherichia coli. The positive control with
primer 538r reacted with all 16S rRNA molecules. This
indicated that the loops were not transcribed from the
16S rDNA to the 16S rRNA of strain TGOT. Comparison of the size of the 16S rDNA and 16S rRNA
showed that the sizes were respectively 1700 and
1500 bp. This confirms the absence of the loops in the
16S rRNA observed with the dot-blot hybridizations
(Fig. 3). It is unclear how the transcription of the
rRNA is regulated.
Sequence analysis showed that strain TGOT is only
distantly related to Moorella glycerini and Moorella
thermoacetica (Slobodkin et al., 1997 ; Collins et al.,
1994), with respective levels of similarity of 92 and
90 %. The similarities were calculated with the use of
the 16S rDNA sequence of strain TGOT without the
additional loops. A phylogenetic tree showing the
relationship of strain TGOT and other related species
is depicted in Fig. 4.
The GjC content of strain TGOT was 33n8 mol %.
Taxonomy

Our findings indicate that strain TGOT differs physiologically and phylogenetically from previously described species. Strain TGOT is phylogenetically most
similar to the genus Moorella (90–92 % similarity), but

the phylogenetic relationship is not sufficiently close to
classify strain TGOT in this genus. Also, the ability of

separates it from members of this genus. Therefore, we

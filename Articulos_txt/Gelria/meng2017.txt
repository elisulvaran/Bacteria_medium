In order to investigate long-term effect of cefalexin (CFX) on the performance of expanded granular
sludge bed (EGSB) system and microbial community structure, two 1.47 L EGSB reactors E1 and E2 were
designed and run for 224 days treating with synthetic antibiotic wastewater. For the purpose of comparison, E1 was fed with synthetic antibiotic industry wastewater with CFX added as the test reactor,
while, E2 was fed without any CFX added as the control reactor (E2). The addition of CFX resulted in the
continual increasing of soluble COD (sCOD) and accumulation of VFAs in the efﬂuent of E1 system. Besides, it was found that the accumulation of CFX by-products D-1, D-2 and D-3 was negative correlation
with sCOD removal efﬁciency. Furthermore, the microbial community structures were also investigated.
For the bacterial community, Gelria and Syntrophorhabdus which can ferment propionate and other
organic pollutants as their substrate were obviously enriched in E1 system. For the archaea, there was
more functional diversity in E1 system than in E2 system. Furthermore, fungi also played an important
role on the removal of complex organics in E1 system.

pollutants in the environment because of their potential long-term
adverse impact on environmental microorganisms. And previous
studies have shown that most antibiotics in the environment comes
from antibiotics manufacture waste streams which contain much
higher concentrations of antibiotics (Saravanane et al., 2001a;
Larsson et al., 2007). Under high concentration, antibiotics will
interfere the running of Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs)

216

and related treating critical processes such as carbon removal
(Amin et al., 2006; Chelliapan et al., 2006). Some studies have
investigated the impacts of antibiotics on the performance of
anaerobic reactor. For example, tracycline exerted a terminal/lethal
effect at 8.5 mg/L on the microbial community under anaerobic
conditions, which caused the inhibition of substrate/COD utilization and biogas generation and even a total collapse of the reactor
(Cetecioglu et al., 2013). However, extremely high levels of tylosin
in the antibiotic manufactured wastewater were still compatible
with stable performance (Chelliapan et al., 2006), and it was also
conﬁrmed that high concentration of amoxicillin was unlikely to
create problems in anaerobic reactor (Meng et al., 2015b).
Usually, in anaerobic system, four main steps are involved for
organic pollutants removal (COD degradation) (Narihiro and
Sekiguchi, 2007): hydrolysis (protein), fermentation (sugars and
amino acid), acetogenesis (VFAs) and methanogenesis (acetic acid,
H2 and CO2). Any step inhibited by the antibiotics will lead to the
decrease of organic pollutants removal efﬁciency in anaerobic
system. And different class of antibiotics may cause diverse effects
to different organics degradation steps.
As a direct result of above issues, antibiotics in wastewater could
trigger signiﬁcant changes of microbial communities, affecting the
stable operation of treatment system. And previous studies have
also proven this by investigating the impacts of some antibiotics on
microbial communities, especially on bacterial and archaea communities (Kor-Bicakci et al., 2016; Aydin et al., 2015; Meng et al.,
2015a). For example, according to our previous studies, increasing
concentration of amoxicillin from 20 to 200 mg/L in the inﬂuent,
Firmicute, Bacteroidetes, Cloacimonetes, Ignavibacteriae and
Thermotogae were the most dominant bacterial groups and
Methanosaeta was the main compositions of archaea community in
amoxicillin manufacture wastewater treatment system (Meng
et al., 2015b). However, Deltaproteobacteria became the major
bacterial groups and archaea afﬁliated with Methanomethylovorans
hollandica-like methylotroph was abundant in anaerobic reactors
treating antibiotic-bearing (mainly streptomycin) wastewater
(Deng et al., 2012). And the long-term adverse impact of sulfamethoxazole was quite variable for fermentative bacteria and
methanogenic archaea fractions of the microbial community
(Cetecioglu et al., 2015). Some kind of antibiotics may lead to the
favored growth of some special bacterial and archaea groups,
contributing to maintain the stable operation of the treatment
system.
Except for bacteria and archaea, eukarya such as fungi can also
decompose complex organic compounds in wastewater treatment
system (Guest and Smith, 2011), but it is normally neglected. Recent
research show ascomycota can decompose complex organic compounds such as PAHs, oil and phenol in wastewater (Bankar et al.,
2009; Deng et al., 2010). For biological treatment solutions,
white-rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been one of the
most studied species due to its ability for degrading phenolic
compounds (Jaouani et al., 2005), and Trametes versicolor has been
proved to be a powerful decontaminant of different types of pollutants such as dyes, chlorobenzenes, polybrominated ﬂame renquez et al., 2004; Marco-Urrea
tardants and pharmaceutical (Bla
et al., 2009a, 2009b; Rodríguez-Rodríguez et al., 2012). Besides,
pervious research found the fungal carbon-degrading gene groups
were signiﬁcantly correlated with the oxytetracycline and penicillin concentration, and the role of fungal functional genes was
enhanced by antibiotics (Zhang et al., 2013). Phoma sp was
conﬁrmed could biotransform some pharmaceuticals and personal
care products (PPCPs) in the aquatic environment (Hofmann and
Schlosser, 2015). Some studies also showed that fungal treatment
could remove most of the pharmaceutical active compounds in
hospital wastewater (Mir-Tutusaus et al., 2017) and urban

wastewater (Badia-Fabregat et al., 2015). Hence, fungi in antibiotic
wastewater treatment process may play a key role in removal of
complex organic pollutants and antibiotics.
CFX is effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative
organisms like penicillin. And CFX is one of the most prescribed
antibiotics and is produced in great quantities, which concentration
is high in synthetic drug-based efﬂuents (Sundararaman, 2009).
Therefore, for CFX manufacture wastewater, microbial toxicity and
recalcitrance of CFX may affect sCOD removal efﬁciency in the
treatment systems, leading to the treatment systems breakdown.
Furthermore, some research indicated the by-products of antibiotics degradation were found to be more toxic than antibiotics
themselves (Li et al., 2008; Wang and Lin, 2012) and might affect
the performance of reactor. However, little has been done to evaluate the impacts of the CFX or its byproducts on the performance of
treatment system and microbial community in biological treatment
systems from a holistic view.
This study aimed to reveal how the addition of high CFX concentration (simulating CFX manufacture wastewater) into the
inﬂuent affected the EGSB reactor run and microbial community
structure response in the systems. To answer this question, the
long-term inhibitory effect of CFX was evaluated by monitoring
accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), sCOD removal efﬁciency
and CFX by-products. Furthermore, microbial community structures including bacteria, archaea and fungi in the EGSB system were
analyzed by high-through sequencing technology.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Operation of EGSB reactor systems
Two the same EGSB reactors (E1 and E2), which had the liquid
volume of 1.47L as SFig. 1, were inoculated using granular sludge
from an EGSB reactor that is used to treat antibiotic wastewater
contained amoxicillin and ﬂocculent sludge from a full scale
municipal wastewater treatment plant, inoculated at a volume ratio
of approximately 1:1. The amount of mixed liquor volatile suspended solid (MLVSS) was 23.41 g/L. The two EGSB reactors were
operated under mesophilic condition (35 ± 2  C) by water bath.
Liquid up-ﬂow velocity (Vup ¼ 1.6 m/h) was also controlled by
inner recirculation with a peristaltic pump. The sludge in the
reactor wasn't discharged in the whole operation. The composition
of synthetic wastewater from the fermentation liquor of antibiotics
constituted about 6500 mg sCOD/L mainly contained acetate, propionate, isobutyrate, butyrate, isovalerate and other main organic
pollutants (as STable 1). In the whole operation term, the inﬂuent
pH value maintained at 7 ± 0.2 and the HRT was 24 h.
2.2. The experimental approach
The operation of the two EGSBs included a start-up period of
approximately 74 days was fed with fermentation liquor of antibiotic manufacture process without CFX to allow acclimation and
establishment of steady-state conditions. Then the concentration of
CFX in E1 reactor inﬂuent kept around 200 mg/L through successive
phases, in order to observe long-term effect of CFX on the performance of EGSB. The E2 reactor was fed without any antibiotics was
operated for the entire research period under identical conditions,
and this served as the control reactor.
2.3. Sampling and chemical analysis
Analysis of sCOD was conducted in accordance with standard
method (APHA, 2005). VFAs were determined according to
pervious method (Chelliapan et al., 2006). CFX determination was

L.-W. Meng et al. / Chemosphere 184 (2017) 215e223

syringe ﬁltered through a 0.45 mm nylon membrane to remove
biomass. Samples were stored at 4  C until analysis. CFX concentration was measured using an HPLC (warers1525-2996-tcm)
equipped with a Waters Sunﬁre C18 (5 mm  20 mm  4.6 mm)
guard column and a Jasco ProSar/Dynamax UV detector. The mobile
phase was a mixture of ultrapure water with formic acid (0.1%)
(mobile phase A), and methanol (mobile phase B) pumped at a ﬂow
rate of 0.8 mL/min through the column. The gradient started with
10% of mobile phase B for 0.5 min, increased to 60% from 0.5 to
12 min, decreased to 10% from 12 to 15 min, remained at 10% until
5.0 min. The sample injection volume was 10 mL. Peaks were
monitored by UV absorbance at 254 nm and 270 nm with a
sensitivity of 0.005 AUFS. Quantiﬁcation of CFX was obtained by
comparison to the external standard peak height ratios as a function of concentration. A calibration curve was prepared with ﬁve
standards (0e300 mg/L), and the correlation coefﬁcient
(r2 ¼ 0.999) and method detection limit (MDL) (0.1 mg/L) were
determined. Water quality samples were preserved as indicated
and analyzed within their holding time.
2.4. Sampling and DNA extraction
Sludge samples were collected at day 0 (inoculated sludge is the
same in E1 and E2 reactor, marked S0) and at day 224 in the E1
(marked S1) and E2 (marked S2) reactor. DNA was extracted from a
0.25 g sample of sludge with the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO
BIO Laboratories, USA), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Concentrations and quality of the extracted DNA were
checked by spectrophotometric analysis on a NanoDrop ND-2000
(Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, USA) and electrophoresis on a 1%
(weight/volume) agarose gel. Then extracted DNA was stored
at 20  C until analysis.
2.5. QPCR assays and PCR ampliﬁcation of 16S rRNA and ITS genes
and sequencing with Illumina MiSeq
QPCR assays were performed for the quantiﬁcation of bacterial
16S rRNA, archaea 16S rRNA and fungal rRNA genes using primers
341f/758r, 931f/M1100r and FR1/FF390, respectively (STable 2).
Besides, the experiment condition and statistical analysis were
showed in the previous study (Deng et al., 2012).
The DNA was ampliﬁed with a set of primers targeting of the
bacteria (16S rRNA), archaea (16S rRNA) and fungi gene (ITS). Their
forward and reverse primers were showed in STable 3, respectively.
The 50 mL reaction solution consisted of 10 ng of the extracted DNA
template, 2.5 U of Plantium® Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen,
USA), 5 mL of the supplied 10  TAP buffer (Takara, China), 0.5 mL of
dNTPs (10 mM), and 0.5 mL of the combined forward and reverse
primers. The PCR proceeded under the following conditions: 94  C
for 3 min; 5 cycles of 94  C for 30 s, 45  C for 20 s, and 65  C for 30 s;
20 cycles of 94  C for 20 s, 55  C for 20 s, and 72  C for 30 s; followed
by a ﬁnal extension at 72  C for 5 min. The PCR products were
puriﬁed with the SanPrep Column DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Sangon,
China) and quantiﬁed with a Qubit 2.0 ﬂuorometer (Invitrogen,
USA). The amplicons from different samples were mixed in equimolar amounts and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform
with the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (Illumina, USA).

and screened for chimeric sequences with the pre.cluster command
and chimera.uchime command, respectively, in Mothur (Schloss
et al., 2009). The resulting effective sequences were used for the
subsequent bioinformatic analysis. Operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) with identities of 97% were identiﬁed using Usearch (vs
esion 7.1 http://drive5.com/uparse/). The OTU-based analysis of the
alpha diversity indices, including richness, the Shannon index,
abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE), Chao1, and coverage,
was performed with Mothur (version v.1.30. http://www.mothur.
org/wiki/Schloss_SOP#Alpha_diversity). Each sequence was
assigned to a taxonomic rank in RDP Classiﬁer (version 2.2 http://
sourceforge.net/projects/rdp-classiﬁer/) and a conﬁdence value of
70%. In the taxonomic ranking of families with relative abundances
of >1%, the unclassiﬁed sequences were picked, and grouped into
OTUs with 97% identity. Accession numbers of the bacteria (16S
rRNA), archaea (16S rRNA) and fungi (ITS) in the NCBI Sequence
Read Archive were showed in the STable 4.
2.7. Statistical analysis
The conversion percent of CFX by-products was standardized to
further analysis using the formula, Z ¼ X/Y, where X is relative
concentration of CFX by-products in the efﬂuent (Calibration curve
of CFX was applied in CFX by-products calculation), and Y is the CFX
concentration in the inﬂuent. Statistical analyses were conducted
using SPSS 21.0 software package (Statistical Program for Social
Sciences) to examine the relationship between COD removal efﬁciency and conversion percent of CFX by-product. Generally, P
values < 0.01 are regarded as signiﬁcant.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Treatment performance of the system
3.1.1. COD removal
Long term results of sCOD removal ability of the two EGSB
systems are shown in Fig. 1. During the days of 0e224, the concentration of sCOD in the inﬂuent was all controlled around
6500 mg/L. At the very beginning, during the days 0e74, the two
EGSB systems both run without CFX, and they exhibited parallel
stable sCOD removal ability, with an average efﬂuent sCOD of
903.49 ± 42 mg/L, which corresponded to sCOD removal efﬁciency
of around 85%. On the day 75, CFX was introduced into E1 system,

2.6. Bioinformatic analysis of the sequencing data
Paired sequences were joined with the FLASH ver. 1.2.7 software
(Su et al., 2015). The adaptors, barcodes, and primers were trimmed. Low-quality and short (<200 bp) sequences were removed
with the PRINSEQ-lite ver. 0.19.5 software (Schmieder and
Edwards, 2011). The remaining sequences were further denoised

well E2 run as controlled system without CFX throughout the
whole operation. As what is shown in Fig. 1, in E1 system, sCOD
concentration in the efﬂuent continuously increased to
3919.47 mg/L from the days 75e116. At the same time, sCOD in the
efﬂuent of E2 was about 800 mg/L. However, sCOD removal ability
began to recover from the day 122 in E1 system, and about 28 days
later, sCOD removal almost recovered to the same level with E2
system. Above results showed the addition of CFX had a disadvantageous effect on the removal of sCOD and this effect was
recoverable in the system. The recoverable ability may come from
the contribution of the inoculated sludge taken from the system of
treating amoxicillin manufactory wastewater. When treating
amoxicillin manufacture wastewater, the microorganisms activity
restrained by amoxicillin can be recovered and adapt high concentration amoxicillin condition step by step in the system (Meng
et al., 2015b). Both amoxicillin and CFX belong to b-lactam antibiotics, and CFX may have similar (not same) toxicity function to
microbial community with amoxicillin. The related sludge was
inoculated into the EGSB, which may be one of reasons that
removal ability of sCOD was recoverable. In the previous study, the
same sludge (50%) was inoculated into the anaerobic reactor to
treat oxytetracycline production wastewater, which was advantage
to achieved high organic removal efﬁciency (Yi et al., 2017). Besides,
it was possible that some microbial community adapted or
enriched in the CFX toxic environment, leading to the recovery of
sCOD removal. To answer this question, microbial component dynamic has been investigated as below.
3.1.2. Organic composition removal
The component of CFX synthetic wastewater is complex as
mentioned above, and there are protein, sugars, aromatic compounds and TVFAs mainly contributing to sCOD. SFig. 2 showed
sCOD, TVFAs and other complex organic (components details was
showed in STable 1, in this study was all called ‘others’ contrast to
sCOD and TVFAs) removal results. As shown in SFig. 2-A, sCOD of E2
efﬂuent kept relative stable, and TVFA slightly accumulated in the
early operation and all degraded few days later. Comparison with
E2, in E1 system, sCOD accumulated as soon as CFX added, and
according to SFig. 2-B, sCOD mainly accumulated from TVFAs and
other organic pollutants. The change of dominant VFAs concentration such as acetic acid, propanoic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric
acid, isovaleric acid and valeric acid during the entire operation of
the two reactors are shown in Fig. 2. Comparison with the E2
reactor, in E1 reactor, VFAs accumulated mainly included isobutyric
acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid and valeric acid. And isobutyric
acid concentration varied between 23 and 262 mg/L from the days
80e142 and butyric acid concentration varied between 20 mg/L
and 105 mg/L from the days 80e136. Isovaleric acid and valeric acid
were detected at the max high concentration160 and 70 mg/L,
respectively. However, acetic and propionic acid degradation were
not affected by the addition of CFX and displayed a similar degradation trend in E1 and E2 reactor respectively. Above results
implied that the addition of CFX not inhabit the activity of
methanogens using acetic as substrate and bacteria using propionic
acid as substrate during long-term operation, whereas the removal
of isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, valeric acid and
others organics pollutants were adversely affected.
Fig. 2. VFAs proﬁle in the inﬂuent and efﬂuent of E1 and E2 from the day 68 to 224d.

3.1.3. CFX removal and by-products accumulation in the E1 reactor
The removal efﬁciency of CFX reached to 99% through degradation or conversion into its by-products and the efﬂuent concentration of CFX was around 0.2 mg/L in E1 as shown in Fig. 3-A.
And this CFX removal efﬁciency was obviously higher than that of
previous study (Saravanane et al., 2001b). Besides, the degradation
by-products were detected as shown in the SFig. 3. The conversion

percent of three by-products named D-1, D-2 and D-3 are showed
in Fig. 3-B. From the days 74e116 the D-1 and D-2 had obvious
accumulation and the highest conversion percent could reach to
0.05 and 0.13, respectively. Additionally, D-3 was accumulated after
the day 94, and had obvious increase trendy after the day130. These

(2.42  104). Whereas they were higher than anaerobic reactors
treating antibiotic-bearing (mainly streptomycin) wastewater
(Deng et al., 2013). Fungi component required further study to
reveal what the main function of fungi was in the antibiotic
wastewater treatment system.
3.3. Richness and diversity of microbiological phylotypes
By performing the alignment, the operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) (3% distance) were clustered for the sample S0, S1 and S2,
and the results were showed in Table 2. The Shannon diversity
index provides not only the simply species richness (i.e., the
number of species present) but how the abundance of each species
is distributed (the evenness of the species) among all the species in
the community. Sample S1 had the highest bacterial and archaea
diversity among the three samples. Now, many studies support the
view that greater biodiversity increases ecological stability of the
system. There is a complex and toxicity organic substrate in antibiotic wastewater contained CFX. Therefore, the high diversity of
bacterial and archaea communities in E1 can be considered as a
response of against the toxicity substrate environment. Before
further taxonomic analysis, the rarefaction curves of the three
samples were also determined, as is illustrated in SFig. 5 B, A and F.
The rarefaction curves of the three samples reach level at the
sequencing depth of above the 20000, suggesting that this
sequencing depth was almost cover the whole microbiological
including the bacteria, archaea and fungi diversity in the EGSB
reactors.
3.4. Bacterial taxonomic identiﬁcation and change

Fig. 3. The removal efﬁciency of CFX (A) and the conversion percent of three
byproducts named D-1, D-2 and D-3(B).

results showed that, with the running of EGSB reactor, the degradation pathway of CFX was affected. Besides, some research indicated CFX degradation by-products were found to be more toxic
than itself (Li et al., 2008; Wang and Lin, 2012). And, in the study, it
was found that D-1, D-2 and D-3 were negative correlation with
sCOD removal efﬁciency as shown in Table 1 from the days 75e116,
especially D-1 (R ¼ 0.799, P ¼ 0.000 (<0.01)). It was possible that
accumulation of D-1, D-2 and D-3 affected the activity and structure
of microbial community, which led to the unstable performance of
reactor.
3.2. Quantiﬁcation of different microbial groups by real-time PCR
As SFig. 4 shown, the copy ratio of archaea/bacteria was higher
in the S1 and S2 than the S0. And the copy ratio of archaea/bacteria
reached to 0.28, even under high concentration of CFX condition.
The results showed that, with the running of the E1 and E2 reactor,
archaea become one of the dominant microbial groups that
contributed to the removal of sCOD in the anaerobic condition.
However, the copy ratios of fungi/bacteria were different to that of
archaea/bacteria, and were decreased in S1 (9.95  105) and S2

To identify the phylogenetic diversity of bacterial community in
S0, S1 and S2, we assigned qualiﬁed reads to known phyla, class and
genera in Fig. 4. Fig. 4-P showed that there were 21 (S0), 23 (S1) and
24 (S2) identiﬁed bacterial phyla in three samples respectively. And
the composition of phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes,
and Spirochaetae showed similar in these samples. However, the
relative abundance of some bacterial phyla changed obviously. For
Proteobacteria, the relative abundance in S1 (19.54%) and S2
(17.96%) was lower than that in S0 (44.82%). Bacteroidetes also
showed similar change tendency with Proteobacteria. Therefore, on
phyla level, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes did not affected by the
addition of CFX. Spirochaetae showed the highest relative abundance in S2 (33.32%), lower in S1 (23.31%), and the lowest in S0
(6.10%). And several studies mentioned potential function of microorganisms assigned into Spirochaetae in AD mainly related to
re
hydrolysis of organic matter and production of acetic acid (Rivie
et al., 2009). The addition of CFX led to the relative abundance of
Spirochaetae decline in E1, and then might affect hydrolysis of
organic matter. Well the abundance of Firmicutes was increased in
S1. And some previous studies also revealed the main functional
role for Firmicutes in antibiotic wastewater treatment system
(Casas et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015). This might imply that the addition
of CFX in the inﬂuent was advantage to the enrichment of Firmicutes, contributing to the recovery of sCOD removal.
The class level identiﬁcation of the bacterial communities in S0,
S1, and S2 is illustrated in Fig. 4-C. In Proteobacteria phylum, the

most dominant classiﬁed subgroup was b-Proteobacteria, d-Proteobacteria, and g-Proteobacteria. g-Proteobacteria decreased to
2.52% and 4.66% in S1 and S2 respectively, and b-Proteobacteria was
decreased to 1.67% in S1. An exception is that the relative abundance of d-Proteobacteria was increased in S1 compared to S2 and
S0. In fact, d-Proteobacteria was the main groups in anaerobic reactors treating antibiotic (Deng et al., 2012), and had been also
suggested to be speciﬁcally associated with antibiotic containing
aquatic environments (Li et al., 2011). The class Spirochaetes was
the sole microbes cluster belonging to the phylum Spirochaetae in
the three samples. And its relative abundance has also been
weakened by CFX in E1 system (10%) contrast with E2. And the
phylum Firmicute was mainly divided into Clostridia, Bacilli, and

Erysipelotrichia in the three samples. Clostridia were enriched in E1
and E2, especially in E1. Clostridia was found in the environments
contain antibiotics (Li et al., 2011). Besides, it is known that Clostridia are efﬁcient hydrogen producers and various Clostridia strains
degrade organic acids in a syntrophic association with hydrogenotrophic methanogens.
Standing on the genus level allows us to further infer the
functions of the community as shown in Fig. 4-G. Gelria was
enriched both in the E1 and E2 system. And with CFX addition,
Gelria was almost not been affected in E1, on the contrary, it
increased from 12.35% to 15.48% compared to E2. Interestingly, a
reference species of the genus Geleria, namely G. glutamica, was
isolated from a propionate-oxidizing methanogenic enrichment

L.-W. Meng et al. / Chemosphere 184 (2017) 215e223

culture and was able to grow in co-culture with a hydrogenotrophic
methanogen (Plugge et al., 2002). Coincidently in the whole operation both of E1 and E2, propionate was not accumulated, so this
phenomenon illustrated that the activity of Geleria was not affected
by the toxicity of CFX or its by-products. Syntrophorhabdus was only
notably enriched in S1. It is obligated anaerobic bacterium and can
oxidize aromatic compounds as substrate. And it was detected in
bioreactors treating terephthalate water (Li et al., 2014b). Alistipes,
Smithella, Syntrophobacter, Spirochaeta, Sedimentibacter, and
Macellibacteroides also increased in E1 system contrast to E2 with
variable degrees respectively, which have been guessed that their
growth have an advantage under the addition of CFX and play a
vital role on keeping the stable system operation. In addition to,
they might take part in CFX degradation. Alistipes (3.42% in the S1)
could be detected in most hospital efﬂuent and wastewater treatment plant samples and presented stronger correlation with the
variation of the concentration of some antibiotics (include penicillin G) (Varela et al., 2014). Smithella (2.26% in the S1) and Syntrophobacter (0.40% in the S1) has been suggested as functional
syntrophic benzoate oxidizing bacteria and were described as
syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria in partnership with H2/
formate utilizers like Methanospirillum or Methanoculleus, together
with acetate consumers as Methanosaeta (Ariesyady et al., 2007;
Narihiro et al., 2015). Besides, a reference species of the genus
Spirochaeta (1.60% in the S1), namely Spirochaeta caldaria sp able to
ferment various sugars to organic acids and H2/CO2 (Pohlschroeder
et al., 1994), suggesting that the corresponding bacterial population
likely played the major role in sugars fermentation. Sedimentibacter
can ferment amino acid to butyrate (Breitenstein et al., 2002) and
Macellibacteroides which mesophilic rods with a fermentative and
obligately anaerobic type of metabolism is able to use protein as
electron donor (Jabari et al., 2012). For Wohlfahrtiimonas and
Lutispora, it seems that they are not affected by the addition of CFX
in the system E1 and E2. Comparison with the S0 (22.23%), in the S1
and S2, the relative abundance of Wohlfahrtiimonas decreased to
1.43% and 1.33% respectively. Wohlfahrtiimonas which is strict aerobic bacteria was impossible growth in the anaerobic condition, but
it was possible that DNA could not be degraded completely, leading
to the positive result of detection. Lutispora may specialize substrate hydrolysis in straw hydrolysis (Li et al., 2014a), suggesting it
played a vital role on the substrate hydrolysis in the CFX
wastewater.
Besides, in the three samples, Comamonas, Syntrophus, Syntrophomonas, Petrimonas, Paludibacter, bacteroides and Pseudomonas
could also be detected in three samples and some take great part in
the community. But it seemed that all of these bacteria had been
weaken to some extent by CFX addition. Comamonas which is a
versatile aromatic degradation for phenolics, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatics (Peng et al., 2013) was not
enriched in S1. The relative abundance of Syntrophus and Syntrophomonas which could convert various organic acids produced in
acidogenesis steps to hydrogen and acetate for subsequent methanogenesis in S1 was lower than S2. Though Petrimonas and Bacteroides are hydrolysis/fermentative bacterium, and most of them
produce acetic acid, propionate acid, formate and succinic acid as
s et al., 2005; Hatamoto et al., 2014),
the major end-products (Agne
they were not the main function microorganism of hydrolysis/
fermentation by the effect of long-term CFX addition in the system.
It was possible that these bacteria were inhibited by the addition of
CFX, which lead to the decreasing removal efﬁciency of sCOD at the
beginning stage. However, with the running of reactor, some
advantage bacteria were then enriched in the system as above
mention, contributing to the recovery of sCOD removal efﬁciency.
However, it cannot be ignored there were mainly included uncultured, no rank and unclassiﬁed bacterium that might played a

221

key role on the hydrolysis/fermentative of organic pollutant and
CFX degradation in E1 and E2 systems.
3.5. Archaea taxonomic identiﬁcation
During typical AD systems, complex organic matter can be
degraded and fermented by bacteria and converted ﬁnally into
methane by methanogens as part of their energy metabolism.
Understanding the taxonomic distribution and change of methanogens allows us to infer methano-genic pathway in the systems.
The phylum Euryarchaeota covered almost all the archaea
population in each sample and relative abundance reached to
above 99%. Methanobacterium which is hydrogenotrophic methanogens took great relative abundance in S2 (69.29%) and S0
(54.78%) as shown in Fig. 5. However, being affected by the addition
of CFX, its relative abundance only was 45.04% in S1. On the contrary, hydrogenotrophic Methanospirillum, Methanoculleus, and
Methanolinea were only enriched and accounted for 9.80% of all
methanogen in S1. Although the total relative abundance of
hydrogenotrophic methanogens was weakened (14.45%), new
genius appeared in E1 system. This phenomenon keep well corresponding with the results of bacteria analysis, as the bacteria genus
Geleria that is able to grow in co-culture with hydrogenotrophic
methanogens was enriched in the E1 and E2 system, especially in
the E1 system, thus hydrogenotrophic methanogens might have
higher competitive advantages than others methanogens in the
ESGB system treating the CFX wastewater reactor. It was also the
main reason that propionic acid degradation was not affected by
the addition of CFX. The Methanosaeta which comprises the aceticlastic methanogens can generally be found in the anaerobic
process to produce an extensive amount of methane had the higher
abundance in the S0 (about 20%) than in the S2 (only 3.81%).
Interestingly, the relative abundance of Methanosaeta in S1 reached
to 20%. The result was different to our previous study that growth of
Methanosaeta was inhabited by high concentration of amoxicillin
(Meng et al., 2015b). As mentioned above, the degradation of acetate almost did not affected by CFX, which will depends on Methanosaeta being rich in E1 system. Methanomassiliicoccus utilizing
the hydrogen and methanol as the substrate methanogen was also
enriched in E1 and E2 systems. Given above information, there was
more functional diversity in the E1 systems than in the E2 systems
and indicates that it was beneﬁcial to keep the stable operation of
reactor and resist toxic substance and the shocking from the change
of operation conditions. Addition to, above results strongly suggested that hydrogenotrophic methanogens was the main pathway
for methane generation in the antibiotic wastewater treatment
contained CFX. And acetoclastic, utilizing hydrogen and methanol
methanogenesis were also concluded.

3.6. Fungi taxonomic identiﬁcation
In anaerobic wastewater treatment system, it contains a variety
of microorganisms such as bacteria, archaea and fungi. In general,
the function of bacteria and archaea in the system has always been
concerned, whereas fungi metabolizing wide spectrum of organic
substances has been neglected.
To identify the phylogenetic diversity of fungi community in S0,
S1 and S2, we assigned qualiﬁed reads to known phyla and genera
in Fig. 6. The phylum Ascomycota was the lowest in relative
abundance in S0 (46.35%), higher in the S1 (92.45%), and the
highest in S2 (97.56%) (Fig. 6-P). The results show Ascomycota
which can decompose complex organic compounds such as PAHs,
oil and phenol in wastewater (Deng et al., 2010) was enriched in E1
and E2 system. Previous study also showed Ascomycota is an
important player in pollutant removal under high concentration
level of antibiotic (Deng et al., 2012). Furthermore, Basidiomycota
was only enriched in E1 system, suggesting that the addition of CFX
in E1 had favored the growth of Basidiomycota.
In generous level, the gene Pseudallescheria belonging to Ascomycota were enriched in S1 (76.91%) and S2 (91.89%), whereas
there was relative low abundance of 33.53% in S0 (Fig. 6-G).
Pervious study showed P. boydii, a weakly pathogenic fungus, has
the abilities of both dechlorination and oxidation dioxins in the
bioreactor process (Ishii and Furuichi, 2007; Ishii et al., 2009). In
fact, the fermentation liquor contained complex organic pollution
such as cyanide, benzpyrole and so on, but dioxins weren't

detected. Therefore, for Pseudallescheria, the main function in the
E1 and E2 reactor was unclear. The other gene Phoma (1.25%)
belonging to the phylum Ascomycota only could be detected in the
E1 system, and has the degradation ability to PPCPs (such as the
antibiotic sulfonamides) in the wastewater. The Trichosporon
belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota could be detected in the E1
and E2 and their relative abundance were 5.95% and 0.60%,
respectively. A great variety of Trichosporon species has a high potential to biodegrade phenolic compounds and a wide range of
toxic compounds. So the speciﬁc appearance of Phoma and Trichosporon in E1 showed that these microorganisms maybe contribute
to complex organic pollution or CFX degradation.
4. Conclusion
The addition of CFX had a disadvantageous effect on the removal
of sCOD, but this effect was recoverable. Besides, the high diversity
of bacterial and archaea communities in the E1 system can be
considered as a response of against the toxicity substrate environment. The bacterial genera Gelria and Syntrophorhabdus played
a key role on the degradation of organic pollutants, and hydrogenotrophic methanogens was the main pathway for methane
generation in the antibiotic wastewater treatment system.
Furthermore, the fungi genera Trichosporon and Phoma played an
important role on degradation of complex organic pollution in the
system.

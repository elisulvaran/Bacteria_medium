A novel strictly anaerobic, moderately halophilic and mesophilic bacterium, designated strain
SOL3f37T, was isolated from a hydrocarbon-polluted soil surrounding a deep petroleum
environment located in south Tunisia. Cells of strain SOL3f37T stained Gram-positive and were
motile, straight and spore-forming. Strain SOL3f37T had a typical Gram-positive-type cell-wall
structure, unlike the thick, multilayered cell wall of its closest relative Clostridiisalibacter
paucivorans. The major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 (41 %), iso-C14 : 0 3-OH and/or iso-C15 : 0
dimethyl acetal (21.6 %), iso-C13 : 0 (4.4 %), anteiso-C15 : 0 (3.9 %) and iso-C15 : 1 (2.8 %). Strain
SOL3f37T grew between 20 and 48 6C (optimum 40 6C) and at pH 6.2–8.1 (optimum pH 6.9).
Strain SOL3f37T required at least 0.5 g NaCl l”1 and grew in the presence of NaCl
concentrations up to 150 g l”1 (optimum 40 g l”1). Yeast extract (2 g l”1) was required for
degradation of pyruvate, fumarate, fructose, glucose and mannitol. Also, strain SOL3f37T grew
heterotrophically on yeast extract, peptone and bio-Trypticase, but was unable to grow on
Casamino acids. Sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite, elemental sulfur, fumarate, nitrate and nitrite were not
reduced. The DNA G+C content was 30.7 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA
gene sequences revealed that strain SOL3f37T was a member of the family Clostridiaceae in the
order Clostridiales; strain SOL3f37T was related to members of various genera of the family
Clostridiaceae. It exhibited highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (93.4 %) with
Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T, 91.8 % with Thermohalobacter berrensis CTT3T and
91.7 % with Caloranaerobacter azorensis MV1087T. On the basis of genotypic, phenotypic and
phylogenetic data, it is suggested that strain SOL3f37T represents a novel species in a new
genus. The name Sporosalibacterium faouarense gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed, with SOL3f37T
(5DSM 21485T 5JCM 15487T) as the type strain of Sporosalibacterium faouarense.

The Clostridiales constitutes one of the largest of the
eubacterial orders. It encompasses a complex range of
bacteria that may be Gram-negative or Gram-positive,
psychrophilic, mesophilic or thermophilic, spore-forming
or non-spore-forming, chemo-organoheterotrophic or
chemolithotrophic and have been found in a variety of
habitats, and it includes a large number of eukaryotic
pathogens (Cato et al., 1986). The family Clostridiaceae
was the first of the 19 families within the order
Clostridiales to be described, and it contains the type
Abbreviation: DMA, dimethyl acetal.
The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene
sequence of strain SOL3f37T is EU567322.

genus of the order. It contains 13 recognized genera, of
which the type genus, Clostridium, contains about 190
recognized species at the time of writing. Recently, the
systematics of the Clostridiaceae have been found to differ
significantly from previous descriptions (Wiegel, 2009).
Several of the species that were not in the radiation of the
genus Clostridium sensu stricto have been transferred to
new genera and other families, in some cases even in
different orders. The taxa presently placed into the
Clostridiaceae are generally obligately anaerobic rods.
Although most of the species are neutrophiles, several
alkaliphilic, alkalithermophilic, moderately halophilic,
haloalkaliphilic and slightly acidophilic species have been
described (Wiegel, 2009).

Here, the isolation and characterization are reported of a
novel strictly anaerobic, moderately halophilic, heterotrophic, spore-forming bacterium, belonging to the family
Clostridiaceae, which originated from a hydrocarbonpolluted soil surrounding a deep petroleum environment
located in the El Faouar area in south Tunisia. It is
suggested that this strain, SOL3f37T, represents a novel
species in a new genus of the order Clostridiales.
Samples were collected in sterile tubes from a hydrocarbonpolluted soil surrounding a deep petroleum environment
located in the El Faouar area in south Tunisia, transported
to our laboratory and stored at 4 uC until analysis. The NaCl
concentration of the samples was 36 g l21. The temperature
of the soil at the sampling site was 35–39 uC during the day.
Samples were collected at the surface of the soil (0–2 cm
deep) and the pH of the soil was 6.8.
Enrichment and isolation were performed using an
anaerobic enrichment medium, which contained (per litre
distilled water) 0.3 g KH2PO4, 0.3 g K2HPO4, 1.0 g NH4Cl,
40 g NaCl, 0.5 g KCl, 0.2 g CaCl2, 0.5 g cysteine hydrochloride, 2 g yeast extract (Difco), 5 g bio-Trypticase, 3 g
glucose, 1 ml mineral element solution (Widdel & Pfennig,
1981) and 1 ml 0.1 % (w/v) resazurin. The medium was
adjusted to pH 7.1 with 10 M KOH. This enrichment
medium was boiled under a stream of O2-free N2 gas and
cooled to room temperature and 5 ml aliquots were then
distributed into Hungate tubes under a stream of O2-free
N2 gas. The N2 gas phase was replaced with N2/CO2
(80 : 20) and the tubes were autoclaved. To initiate
enrichment cultures, a small portion of the soil sample
was inoculated into the growth medium and incubated at
37 uC without agitation. The Hungate technique was then
used throughout isolation and study for physiological and
metabolic characterization.
Enrichment cultures showed growth after 24 h incubation
at 37 uC and microscopic examination revealed the
presence of motile rod-shaped bacteria. Growth was
determined by inserting culture tubes directly into a model
Cary 50 Scan spectrophotometer (Varian) and measuring
the OD580. Cultures were purified by repeating the
Hungate roll-tube method (Hungate, 1969) and using
enrichment medium solidified with 2 % (w/v) agar (Difco).
Several colonies were picked and cultured in the corresponding culture medium. The isolation process was
repeated several times until isolates were deemed to be
axenic. Several axenic cultures were obtained using this
process and one strain, named SOL3f37T, was used for
further characterization.
Cells of strain SOL3f37T were straight, thin and long rods
(0.565.0–10.0 mm) that grew singly or in pairs. Cells were
motile by means of a monotrichous laterally inserted
flagellum (Fig. 1). Strain SOL3f37T stained Gram-positive.
Spherical and terminal spores were observed, mainly in old
cultures. Strain SOL3f37T showed a typical Gram-positivetype cell-wall structure, unlike the thick, multilayered cell
wall of its closest relative Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans.

Fatty acid methyl esters were extracted from fresh biomass
by the CCUG using the standard Microbial Identification
System procedure (Microbial ID). The Microbial ID system
was used to compare the fatty acid methyl esters of strain
SOL3f37T with fatty acid patterns stored in the fatty acid
database. Six fatty acid components were found at levels
greater than 2 % (Table 1), with an exceptionally high
percentage of the fatty acid component iso-C15 : 0 (41 %).
The other major components were identified as iso-C14 : 0
3-OH and/or iso-C15 : 0 dimethyl acetal (DMA) (21.6 %),
iso-C13 : 0 (4.4 %), anteiso-C15 : 0 (3.9 %), iso-C15 : 1 (2.8 %)
and one major component that remained unidentified
(12.5 %).
Strain SOL3f37T did not grow in anaerobic enrichment
medium containing traces of oxygen (as indicated by the
pink-coloured resazurin in the growth medium) and was
therefore described as a strict anaerobe. It grew anaerobically at 20–48 uC, with an optimum at 40 uC.
Substrate utilization was studied using anaerobic basal
medium containing (per litre distilled water) 0.3 g
KH2PO4, 0.3 g K2HPO4, 1.0 g NH4Cl, 40.0 g NaCl, 0.5 g
KCl, 0.2 g CaCl2 and 0.5 g cysteine hydrochloride. Yeast
extract (0.2 g or 2.0 g l21) was added to this basal medium.
For determination of NaCl requirements, NaCl was
weighed directly into tubes at concentrations up to 200 g
l21 before dispensing basal medium without NaCl. The
strain did not grow when NaCl was omitted from the basal
medium. It grew in NaCl concentrations ranging from 0.5
to 150 g l21 (optimum 40 g l21). For pH studies, the same
medium was adjusted to the desired pH using anaerobically prepared stock solutions of NaHCO3 (10 %) or
Na2CO3 (8 %). Growth occurred between pH 6.2 and 8.1;
the optimum pH was 6.9. Yeast extract (2 g l21) was
required for degradation of the carbon substrates pyruvate,

fumarate, fructose, glucose and mannitol (all at 20 mM).
Furthermore, strain SOL3f37T grew heterotrophically on
yeast extract, peptone and bio-Trypticase, but was unable
to grow on Casamino acids. Fumarate was reduced to
succinate. End products from pyruvate utilization were
acetate, H2 and CO2. Strain SOL3f37T did not use
cellobiose, cellulose, galactose, lactose, maltose, mannose,
ribose, sucrose, xylose, melibiose, arabinose, glycerol,
ethanol, methanol, acetate, propionate, butyrate, lactate,
citrate, xylan or starch. Acetate was produced after growth
on glucose, fructose and mannitol. None of the amino
acids tested (at 20 mM), including threonine, glycine,
proline, tyrosine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine,
cysteine, lysine, serine, valine, alanine, arginine, tryptophan, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamine, glutamic acid,
methionine and histidine, supported growth.
Sulfate, thiosulfate and elemental sulfur were added separately
to the anaerobic basal medium at final concentrations of
http://ijs.sgmjournals.org

20 mM, 20 mM and 0.1 % (w/v), respectively, for potential
use as an electron sink. Nitrate and nitrite utilization tests
were carried out in triplicate in butyl-capped Hungate tubes
filled with 5 ml pre-reduced medium (without resazurin and
Na2S) distributed under a nitrogen atmosphere. NaNO3
(10 mM) or NaNO2 (10 mM) was added to the tubes
immediately before inoculation (10 %, v/v). These tests were
carried out under similar conditions without pre-reducing
the medium and without a nitrogen atmosphere for oxygen
utilization.
Sulfate (20 mM), thiosulfate (20 mM), elemental sulfur
(0.1 %), nitrate (20 mM) and nitrite (2 mM) were not used
as electron acceptors. The sulfur test was carried out
photometrically as colloidal CuS (Fardeau et al., 1997) and
nitrate/nitrite reduction was assayed using specific sticks
(Quantofix; Macherey-Nagel).
The DNA G+C content, determined by the Identification
Service of the DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Braunschweig,
Germany) using the method of Mesbah et al. (1989), was
30.7 mol%.
Genomic DNA of strain SOL3f37T was extracted using the
Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit following the
manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). The universal primers
Fd1 (59-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-39) and Rd1 (59AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC-39) were used to amplify the
16S rRNA gene. The nucleotide sequence (1497 bases) was
aligned manually using the sequence alignment editor
BioEdit (Hall, 1999). Reference sequences were obtained
from the Ribosomal Database Project II (Maidak et al.,
2001) and GenBank (Benson et al., 1999). Pairwise
evolutionary distances based on 1246 unambiguous
nucleotides were computed by the method of Jukes &
Cantor (1969). The phylogenetic tree obtained by the
neighbour-joining method (Saitou & Nei, 1987) is shown
in Fig. 2; its topology was supported by the maximumparsimony and maximum-likelihood algorithms (not
shown).
16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of strain SOL3f37T revealed
that it was a member of the family Clostridiaceae of the order
Clostridiales, as defined in the currently proposed taxonomy
in Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (Wiegel, 2009).
The three most closely related strains with validly published
names were Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T,
Caloranaerobacter azorensis MV1087T and Thermohalobacter berrensis CTT3T, with sequence similarity of 93.4,
91.7 and 91.8 %, respectively. These three type strains belong
to three different genera. Other closely related type strains
with validly published names include Clostridium purinilyticum ATCC 33906T, Clostridium acidurici ATCC 7906T
and Eubacterium angustum ATCC 43737T, which showed
sequence similarities with strain SOL3f37T below 92 % (91.9,
91.6 and 88.8 %, respectively; Fig. 2).
Numerous phenotypic characteristics of strain SOL3f37T
enabled it to be distinguished unambiguously from

phylogenetically closely related type strains, including
Clostridium purinilyticum ATCC 33906T (Dürre et al.,
1981) and Clostridium acidurici ATCC 7906T (Liebert,
1909). Isolate SOL3f37T was metabolically distinct from
these species, which grew on purines such as uric acid and
adenine and on amino acids such as glycine. However,
none of them grew on sugars (Wery et al., 2001), whereas
strain SOL3f37T grew on two sugars (glucose and fructose),
but not on amino acids, including glycine.
Strain SOL3f37T differed markedly from Thermohalobacter
berrensis CTT3T. Strain SOL3f37T stained Gram-positive
and was spore-forming, whereas Thermohalobacter berrensis CTT3T stained Gram-negative and was a non-sporulating rod (Cayol et al., 2000). Strains SOL3f37T and
Thermohalobacter berrensis CTT3T also differed in their
growth conditions; strain SOL3f37T, a slightly thermotolerant bacterium, grew between 20 and 48 uC (optimum
40 uC), whereas Thermohalobacter berrensis CTT3T, a strict
thermophile, grew at up to 70 uC (optimum 65 uC), but
not below 45 uC.
Strain SOL3f37T also differed unambiguously from
Caloranaerobacter azorensis MV1087T (Wery et al., 2001).
Strain SOL3f37T stained Gram-positive, whereas Caloranaerobacter azorensis MV1087T was Gram-negative and
had a characteristic Gram-negative cell wall. In addition,
the DNA G+C content of Caloranaerobacter azorensis
MV1087T (27.0 mol%) was significantly lower than the
value calculated for strain SOL3f37T (30.7 mol%). Furthermore, Caloranaerobacter azorensis MV1087T and strain
SOL3f37T did not use the same carbohydrates; in contrast
to Caloranaerobacter azorensis MV1087T, strain SOL3f37T
was able to use glucose, fructose and mannitol but not
arabinose, ribose, xylose, galactose or sorbose. Strain
SOL3f37T also differed from Caloranaerobacter azorensis
MV1087T in terms of physiological growth conditions; the
optimum growth temperature of strain SOL3f37T was
40 uC, whereas Caloranaerobacter azorensis MV1087T was
able to grow at up to 70 uC, with optimum growth at
102

65 uC. Hence, unlike Caloranaerobacter azorensis
MV1087T, which is thermophilic, strain SOL3f37T was
only slightly thermotolerant.
Finally, strain SOL3f37T could be distinguished unambiguously from Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T in
terms of marked differences in their morphological, genetic
and physiological traits. Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans
37HS60T (Liebgott et al., 2008) was able to utilize the
organic acids succinate, fumarate and pyruvate (all at
20 mM), whereas strain SOL3f37T was unable to use
succinate, but could use fumarate and pyruvate, as well as
glucose, fructose and mannitol (Table 2). Strain SOL3f37T
and Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T both reduced
fumarate slowly to succinate. End products from pyruvate
fermentation were acetate, H2 and CO2. Unlike Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T, which was unable to use
sugars as carbon sources, strain SOL3f37T produced acetate
after growth on glucose, fructose and mannitol. Like
Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T, strain SOL3f37T
was an anaerobic, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium.
However, the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between
strain SOL3f37T and Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans
37HS60T was less than 93.4 %, and numerous phenotypic
characteristics of isolate SOL3f37T were completely distinct. Strain SOL3f37T differed from Clostridiisalibacter
paucivorans 37HS60T in its inability to use Casamino acids
and amino acids. Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T
was able to use cysteine, lysine, serine and valine for
growth, whereas strain SOL3f37T was unable to grow on
any of the 20 amino acids tested. Strain SOL3f37T and
Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T were both mesophilic and slightly thermotolerant, with a similar temperature range for growth, but Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans
37HS60T grew at up to 50 uC (optimum 42 uC), whereas
SOL3f37T only grew at up to 48 uC (optimum 40 uC). In
addition, some physiological characteristics enabled
SOL3f37T to be distinguished from its closest relative. Thus,
in contrast to Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T, which
was able to grow at pH 5.5, strain SOL3f37T did not grow

below pH 6.2. Also, unlike SOL3f37T, Clostridiisalibacter
paucivorans 37HS60T was unable to grow in media containing
less than 10 g NaCl l21. The maximum NaCl concentration
for growth of Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T was
100 g l21, whereas strain SOL3f37T was able to grow in NaCl
concentrations up to 150 g l21. Also, the DNA G+C content
of Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T (33.0 mol%) was
significantly higher than the value calculated for strain
SOL3f37T (30.7 mol%). Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans
37HS60T was motile by means of peritrichous flagella,
whereas strain SOL3f37T was motile with a monotrichous
laterally inserted flagellum (Fig. 1). Finally, Clostridiisalibacter
paucivorans 37HS60T showed an atypical thick Gram-positive
http://ijs.sgmjournals.org

cell-wall structure composed of dense and stratified multiple
layers, which is restricted to date within these closely related
genera to the genus Clostridiisalibacter, whereas strain
SOL3f37T showed a typical Gram-positive-type cell-wall
structure.
Taking into account the important differences in phylogenetic distances, strain SOL3f37T represents a novel
species in a new genus in the family Clostridiaceae in the
order Clostridiales, for which the name Sporosalibacterium
faouarense gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. This proposal is
strongly supported by significant differences in genetic,
metabolic and physiological traits and cell-wall structure.

seed and, in bacteriology, a spore; L. n. sal, salis salt; L.
neut. n. bacterium a rod; N.L. neut. n. Sporosalibacterium a
moderately halophilic sporulated rod).
Rod-shaped, motile, Gram-positive bacteria, forming
ovoid to spherical and subterminal to terminal spores.
Spores appear mainly in old cultures. Exhibit a typical
Gram-positive-type cell-wall ultrastructure, unlike the
thick, multilayered cell wall of the closest relative
Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans. Moderately halophilic
and slightly thermotolerant. Strictly anaerobic, chemoorganotrophic. Able to grow on yeast extract, peptone,
bio-Trypticase, pyruvate, fumarate, glucose, fructose and
mannitol, but unable to grow on Casamino acids. Yeast
extract is required for growth. Sulfur, sulfate, thiosulfate,
nitrate and nitrite are not necessary for growth. 16S rRNA
gene sequence comparisons place Sporosalibacterium in
the lineage of the low-G+C-content Gram-positive
bacteria, in the family Clostridiaceae of the order
Clostridiales. The type species is Sporosalibacterium
faouarense.

Displays the following properties in addition to those
described for the genus. Cells are monotrichously flagellated, 0.565.0–10.0 mm, occurring singly or in pairs. The
major fatty acids detected are iso-C15 : 0, iso-C14 : 0 3-OH
and/or iso-C15 : 0 DMA, iso-C13 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0 and isoC15 : 1 and one major component that remains unidentified,
with small proportions of various other fatty acids. Growth
occurs at 20–48 uC (optimum 40 uC). The optimum pH
for growth is 6.9; growth occurs at pH 6.2–8.1. Optimum
NaCl concentration for growth is 40 g l21; grows in the
presence of NaCl concentrations up to 150 g l21.
Heterotrophic. Requires yeast extract in order to degrade
pyruvate, fumarate, fructose, glucose and mannitol. Does
not use elemental sulfur, sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite, nitrate,
nitrite or oxygen as electron acceptors.
The type strain is SOL3f37T (5DSM 21485T 5JCM
15487T), isolated from a hydrocarbon-polluted soil surrounding a deep petroleum environment located in the El
Faouar area in south Tunisia. The G+C content of DNA of
the type strain is 30.7 mol% (HPLC).

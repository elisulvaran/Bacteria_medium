Abstract The shift of microbial communities during a transition from mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) to thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD) was characterized in two
treatments. One treatment was inoculated with sludge and
the other was inoculated with manure. In this study, methane
was produced both in MAD and TAD, but TAD has slightly
more methane produced than MAD. A broad phylogenetic
spectrum of bacterial, archaeal, and fungal taxa at thermophilic conditions was detected. Coprothermobacter, Bacillus,
Haloplasma, Clostridiisalibacter, Methanobacterium,
Methanothermobacter, Saccharomycetales, Candida,
Alternaria, Cladosporium, and Penicillium were found almost
exclusively in TAD, suggesting their adaptation to thermophilic conditions and ecological roles in digesting the organic
compounds. The characterization of the lesser-known fungal
community revealed that fungi probably constituted an important portion of the overall community within TAD and contributed to this process by degrading complex organic compounds. The shift of the microbial communities between

MAD and TAD implied that temperature drastically affected
the microbial diversity in anaerobic digestion. In addition, the
difference in microbial communities between sludge and manure indicated that different source of inoculum also affected
the microbial diversity and community.

Introduction
Anaerobic digestion is a common method to convert biodegradable organic matters to biogas, which is mostly composed
of methane (Nallathambi Gunaseelan 1997). This process is
widely used for industrial and domestic purposes because of
its methane recovery potential and capability for sewage sludge
stabilization (Gujer and Zehnder 1983; Parkin and Owen
1986). Thermophilic anaerobic digestion (TAD) is a wellknown strategy to increase organic loading rates (OLR) and
methane production rates, while simultaneously reducing
solids and potential pathogens as compared to mesophilic systems (De la Rubia et al. 2013; Khemkhao et al. 2012). For
example, mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) took 30 to
40 days to eliminate an approximately 50 % of the initial mass
of the sludge for methane production, whereas only 11 to
14 days were required for the same results under thermophilic
conditions (Zbransk et al. 2000).
TAD, which is usually achieved by inoculating biomass
from MAD at higher temperatures, is a microbiological process mainly mediated by thermophiles including thermophilic
bacteria, archaea, and even eukaryotes (fungi) (De la Rubia
et al. 2013). Previous studies have demonstrated that a wide
diversity of organisms can be classified as thermophiles. A
number of thermophilic bacteria and archaea clustering within

the genera Bacillus (Darland and Brock 1971), Thermus
(Brock and Freeze 1969), Methanosarcina (Zinder and Mah
1979), and Methanosaeta (Kamagata et al. 1992) have been
identified previously. All these bulk studies have shown that
there are dynamic microbial communities inhabiting the TAD
process. An in-depth investigation of the microbial communities during the transition from mesophilic to thermophilic conditions can provide useful information for understanding and
improving the performance of TAD. Although the community
compositions of bacteria and archaea in anaerobic digestion
processes have been investigated (Levén et al. 2007), the role
of fungi has been largely overlooked. Furthermore, the information of the indigenous microbial communities that develop
under thermophilic conditions, especially the community
shifts resulting from the switch from mesophilic to thermophilic conditions is limited.
In the current study, we investigated the bacterial, archaeal,
and fungal communities in activated sludge and manure digestion processes during a shift in temperature from 37 to
58 °C by high-throughput sequencing. A comparative community analysis was performed to investigate the microbial
community dynamics during this transition. Shifts in bacterial
and archaeal communities, as well as fungal communities
were monitored and characterized. The overall goals of this
study are (i) to reveal the shift in microbial communities during the transition from mesophilic to thermophilic conditions
and (ii) to identify and interrogate the ecophysiology of the
predominant thermophiles. It is anticipated that the systematic
microbial community analysis obtained in this study will provide useful information to select the best strategy for the operation of TAD.

up. Methane content in headspace was analyzed using a gas
chromatograph system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA)
equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (J&W Scientific, DB-624, diameter 0.53 mm; Folsom,
CA, USA). Injector and detector temperatures were set at
200 °C and the column temperature was 120 °C. Total solids
(TS) and volatile solids (VS) were measured in accordance
with the standard methods (APHA et al. 2005).
DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing
analysis
After 60 days incubation at two temperature conditions, total
genomic DNA was extracted from three microcosms per treatment using the FastDNA® spin kit (MP bio, Santa Ana, USA)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. The extracted DNA was
homogenized subject to PCR amplification. The V4 variable
region for bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA was amplified with
primer pairs 515F/806R (Caporaso et al. 2011). Fungal internal
transcribed spacer (ITS) was amplified using primer pair ITS1FBt1 (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS4R-bt
(TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC). Sequencing was performed
at Mr. DNA (Shallowater, TX, USA) on a MiSeq platform
following the manufacturer’s guidelines. The sequences were
denoised after depletion of the barcodes and removal of the ones
that were less than 150 bp or having ambiguous bases. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were generated and chimeras
were removed. OTUs were defined by clustering at 97 % similarity. Final OTUs were taxonomically classified using BLAST
against a curated database derived from GreenGenes, RDPII,
and NCBI (DeSantis et al. 2006).The reads were deposited into
the NCBI short reads archive database (SRP059155).

Materials and methods

Statistical analyses

Batch experiments

The similarity of microbial communities among different
treatments was determined using UniFrac. QIIME calculated
both weighted and unweighted UniFrac. Unweighted pair
group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) clustering
were conducted on weighted UniFrac (Kuczynski et al.
2012). The open-source software Cytoscape 2.816 was
employed to visualize the 33 most abundant prokaryotic
genera and 22 most abundant fungal taxa based on their
relative abundances.

Two batch experiments were set up in the current study. The
first experimental setup was inoculated from anaerobic sludge
from a wastewater treatment plant in Michigan, USA. The
second experimental setup was seeded from manure sampled
from a biogas plant in Michigan, USA. Batch experiments
were performed in 160-mL serum bottles filled with 80-mL
sludge (49.5 g/L as total solids) or 80-mL manure (59.3 g/L as
total solids). The headspace was replaced with nitrogen and
carbon dioxide. Resazurin was added to each microcosm as
anaerobic condition indicator. For each experimental setup,
ten microcosms were established and incubated under 37 °C
for 30 days, and then five of them were transferred to 58 °C for
inoculation of thermophilic sludge and manure. The other five
microcosms were still maintained at 37 °C as controls. A total
of four treatments including thermophilic sludge, mesophilic
sludge, thermophilic manure, and mesophilic manure were set

General analyses of the Illumina-derived dataset
A total of eight sequencing libraries were retrieved including
four prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) sequencing libraries
and four fungal sequencing libraries. Detailed information of
sequencing libraries was summarized in Table 1. After filtering the low-quality reads, chimeras and trimming the adapters,
barcodes and primers, a total of 132,431 valid reads (average
read length 280 bp) were identified from four prokaryotic
sequencing libraries and 168,219 valid reads (average read
length 250 bp) were identified from four fungal ITS sequencing libraries through Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The number
of Chao 1, ACE, and Shannon at a cutoff level of 3 % were
summarized in Table 2. Thermophilic conditions may not decrease the microbial diversity as indicated from nonparametric indicators. For example, SWDT has higher Chao
1 and ACE than SWD0. For fungal sequencing libraries, both

sequencing libraries and their

conditions

DSFT and SWFT have higher Chao 1 and ACE than DSF0
and SWF0, respectively, indicating that fungal communities at
higher temperature may be more diverse than at mesophilic
conditions. The Venn diagram, as calculated at a distance of
0.03, with shared and unique OTUs was used to describe the
similarity and difference among different libraries (Fig. 2).
The prokaryotic sequencing libraries shared 152 out of 22,
254 OTUs (0.68 % of the total) that have been observed in
the four treatments. The number of OTUs unique to individual
sequencing library was 7048 (DSD0), 3252 (DSDT), 4306
(SWD0), and 5027 (SWDT), accounting for 88.2 % of the
total observed OTUs. The fungal sequencing libraries shared
39 out of 7345 OTUs (0.53 % of the total) that have been
observed in the four treatments. The number of OTUs unique
to individual sequencing library was 598 (DSF0), 1645
(DSFT), 1527 (SWF0), and 2860 (SWFT), accounting for
90.3 % of the total observed OTUs. The small number of
OTUs shared by all four prokaryotic and fungal libraries indicated diverse microbial communities inhabiting in these
mixed microbial systems.

We taxonomically grouped the Illumina sequencing libraries
according to Ribosome Database Project (RDP). The prokaryotic OTUs fell into 32 different bacterial phyla and 2 archaeal
phyla. Proteobacteria accounted for 45.6 and 25.2 % of the total
valid reads in DSD0 and DSDT, respectively (Figure S1). However, Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in sequencing
libraries derived from manure samples, accounting for 46.5 and
69.3 % in SWD0 and SWDT, respectively. It is notable that
sequences related to Firmicutes were more abundant at thermophilic than mesophilic conditions. As indicated by a previous
study, the 515F/806R primer pair is nearly universal to archaea
and bacteria (Walters et al. 2011). In accordance with this observation, our current study also identified a large number of
archaeal sequences in four libraries. Archaeal reads accounted
for 6.0 % of the total reads, indicating a relatively small amount
of archaeal reads occurring in the libraries compared to bacterial
reads. Euryarchaeota was the most abundant archaeal phylum
in all libraries. Crenarchaeota only constituted a minor fraction
in archaeal reads with relative abundances less than 1 %. Notably, Euryarchaeota increased in abundances at thermophilic
conditions, especially in sludge samples.

Further comparison of the dominant phyla down to class,
order, and genus levels was performed to reveal the microbial
community evolution in response to temperature change. At the
class level, Clostridia was the most abundant bacterial class
accounting for 28.5 % of the total reads, followed by the classes
Deltaproteobacteria (8.68 %), Actinobacteria (7.74 %) and
Betaproteobacteria (7.11 %). A total of ten archaeal classes
were identified and Methanobacteria was the most abundant
in thermophilic libraries (DSDT and SWDT) (Figure S2). In
contrast, Methanomicrobia demonstrated relatively high abundances in mesophilic libraries (DSD0 and SWD0). Diverse microbial communities were also demonstrated at order levels
(Figure S3A). For instance, in thermophilic libraries,
Thermoanaerobacterales, Actinomycetales,
Syntrophobacterales, and Methanobacteriales were the most
dominant orders seeded from sludge, while Clostridiales,
Baci llales, Haloplasmatales, Bacteroidales, and
Thermoanaerobacterales were the dominant orders derived
from manure samples. Notably, Thermoanaerobacterales became the dominant orders in two thermophilic libraries, indicating that the members of Thermoanaerobacterales may contain
many thermophilic species. Furthermore, Methanobacteriales
was the most abundant archaeal order in two thermophilic

libraries, suggesting that Methanobacteriales-affiliated
methanogen may play a central role in thermophilic methane
production.
Fungal taxonomic profile
Fungal phylogenetic affiliation was determined by fungal ITS.
A total of seven fungal phyla were detected (Figure S4). About
82.7 % of the total fungal reads could be assigned to the phylum
Ascomycota, which was the most abundant phylum in libraries
of DSFT, SWF0, and SWFT. Nevertheless, Basidiomycota was
the most dominant phylum in DSF0 (79.4 %). Five other fungal
phyla, including Glomeromycota, Chytridiomycota,
Monoblepharidomycota, Neocallimastigomycota, and
Blastocladiomycota occurred only sparsely. At the class level,
the difference among fungal communities inoculated from different biomasses is distinguished. Dothideomycetes was the
most abundant class in libraries derived from manure samples.
In libraries derived from sludge, the abundance of
Saccharomycetes increased along with temperature increasing.
Conversely, the abundance of Basidiomycota decreased when
the temperature increased. At the fungal order level,
Saccharomycetales became the most dominant fungal order in
two thermophilic libraries, accounting for 22.89 % in SWFT
and 61.56 % in DSFT (Figure S3B). Basidiomycota and
Paraglomerales were other dominant fungal orders in two thermophilic libraries. It is noteworthy that all these three fungal
orders only occurred with low levels in two mesophilic libraries
(<2 %), suggesting that they might be enriched by the temperature increase.
Microbial community evolution in response
to the temperature increase
Differences between four prokaryotic libraries and four fungal
libraries were demonstrated from the 16S rRNA and ITS
amplicon data as shown in Fig. 3. Unifrac PoCA analysis
indicated that temperature may have a significant impact on
the microbial communities, where PoCA axis 1 showed 55.1
and 81.9 % of the variation and PoCA axis 2 showed 31.3 and
14.6 % variation in prokaryotic and fungal communities, respectively. These results were supported by the observed
changes in the representative abundance in the major clades,
especially at the genus level within the prokaryotic and fungal
communities. Libraries of DSD0 and DSDT were clustered,
while SWD0 and SWDT were distantly related (Fig. 3a). A
similar trend was observed in the fungal communities
(Fig. 3b). DSF0 and DSFT were grouped together, whereas
SWFT and SWF0 were not clustered. High temperature is a
primary factor to shift the abundance of the major taxonomic
groups, especially at genus level. Therefore, the analyses
based on the genus level will allow us to compare and further
verify the functional evolution of the community in details.

As illustrated from Fig. 4, sequences related to genera
Coprothermobacter, Dermatophilus, Syntrophus, and
Azoarcus showed relatively high abundances (>5 % relative
abundances) in DSDT. Among these four genera,
Coprothermobacter and Dermatophilus were frequently detected in TAD. In SWDT, Bacillus, Haloplasma,
Proteiniphilum, Clostridiisalibacter, and Caldicoprobacter
occurred at high levels (>5 % relative abundances). In addition, the abundances of Bacillus, Haloplasma,
Clostridiisalibacter, and Caldicoprobacter increased notably
at thermophilic conditions, whereas the number of
Proteiniphilum dropped significantly with a temperature increase. At the thermophilic condition, Methanobacterium
became the most dominant archaeal genus in DSDT
(>90 % of the total archaeal reads) (Fig. 5), while the relative abundances of Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobium, and
Methanothermobacter were less than 5 % of the total
archaeal reads in DSDT. Methanothermobacter and
Methanomicrobium were prevalent in SWDT with relative
abundances greater than 20 % of the total archaeal
reads. Sequences assigned to genera Methanosphaera,

Coprothermobacter, Methanobacterium, Proteiniphilum,
Ruminiclostridium, and Bacillus were the most abundant genera based on the size of the corresponding nodes. For example,
Syntrophus was the most abundant in DSD0 and DSDT.
Coprothermobacter was more abundant in DSDT based on
the size of purple node than other nodes. Bacillus was exclusively abundant in SWDT. Other genera with smaller nodes,
such as Paludibacter and Fastidiosipila, were ubiquitous in
four libraries.
At the fungal Cytoscape network, the sizes of nodes
representing Leptosphaerulina and Basidiomycota were larger
than other taxa (Fig. 8), indicating their dominance in SWF0
and DSF0. A number of purple and yellow nodes demonstrated that the corresponding genera were exclusively enriched in
thermophilic conditions. In accordance with such observation,
many of such genera contained thermophilic fungal species.

Methanobrevibacter, Methanobacterium, Methanosaeta,
Halobacterium, and Methanoculleus demonstrated their relative abundances greater than 1 % of the total archaeal reads
in SWDT.
A number of fungal genera increased their abundances at
thermophilic conditions compared to mesophilic conditions
(Fig. 6). For instance, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Penicillium,
Hypocrea, Epicoccum, Pseudocosmospora, Aspergillus,
Pichia, and Trichosporon were abundant (>3 %) in SWFT.
However, their relative abundances in SWF0 were less
(<1 %) as compared with that in SWFT. Candida,
Dipodascus, Geotrichum, Galactomyces, Exophiala,
Cyberlindnera, Trichoderma, Peyronellaea, Engyodontium,
Rhodotorula, Paraconiothyrium, and Cyclothyrium increased
their relative abundances significantly with the increase in
temperature. In contrast, the genus of Leptosphaerulina
(81 % in SWF0), which dominated in mesophilic conditions,
decreased its abundance notably at the elevated temperatures.
Furthermore, a profile clustering network analysis was applied to compare the differences of the microbial communities
at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions in a straightforward
way. One can determine the change of abundances of a certain
genus in different libraries based on the size of corresponding
node. The network analysis generated by a Cytoscape network
showed the most abundant prokaryotic and fungal genera and
highlighted their relative distribution and abundances. At the
bacterial network (Fig. 7), Syntrophus, Dermatophilus,

Discussion
Previous studies indicated that temperature had a remarkable
impact on microbial communities in many microbial systems,
such as enhanced biological phosphorus removal system
(Panswad et al. 2003), hot springs (Skirnisdottir et al. 2000),
acid mine drainage (Sun et al. 2015), and activated sludge
(Wang et al. 2012). Therefore, we proposed that a change of
temperature from 37 to 58 °C may result in the shift of

microbial communities by selecting these microorganisms
able to adapt to the thermal environment. These enriched microorganisms may play an important role in TAD and investigation of these microorganisms may provide critical information for operating and optimizing the performance of TAD.
In addition, methane production rate in thermophilic conditions is slightly higher than mesophilic conditions. This discrepancy in methane production might be due to the change of
major methanogens, as discussed later.

In accordance with our hypothesis, the microbial community results showed significant differences between
mesophilic and thermophilic conditions as indicated by PCoA
and UPGMA analyses. At phylum level, a remarkable observation was that the abundances of Firmicutes increased in
both manure and sludge samples when temperature increased
to 58 °C. The dominance of Firmicutes-related bacteria in
thermophilic conditions could be related to their ability of
adaptation to living in thermal environments. Our

observations were supported by previous studies where
Firmicutes has also been detected in the extreme thermophilic
environments (Emmerich et al. 2012; Orcutt et al. 2010).
In this study, we have been able to capture broader phylogenetic taxa than in any previous studies of TAD, including
sequences of several taxa that were rarely detected before. Several fungal phyla, including Glomeromycota, Chytridiomycota,
Monoblepharidomycota, Neocallimastigomycota, and
Blastocladiomycota were seldom reported in TAD. These fungal phyla only constituted a minor fraction in the total fungal
reads (2.3 % overall). However, we could not rule out the
possibility that they played an ecological role in TAD.
Ascomycota was the dominant fungal phylum in two thermophilic sequencing libraries (DSFT and SWFT) and one
mesophilic sequencing library (SWF0), accounting for more
than 90 % of the total reads in manure sequencing libraries
and 70 % in DSFT. The dominance of Ascomycota-related
fungi suggested their importance in TAD. In agreement with
this observation, Ascomycota has been reported as important
decomposers (Osono 2003) for breaking down organic compounds (Štursová et al. 2012).
Deeper sequencing at the genus level revealed that some
genera were enriched atthermophilic conditions, indicating
these microorganisms were able to survive or even thrive under thermophilic conditions. Remarkably, different genera
were enriched in manure and sludge samples, indicating that
the inocula were another important factor in determining the
microbial community compositions. Some of the enriched
genera have been identified as thermophiles. However, several
genera have rarely been detected in thermophilic conditions,
especially fungal genera, suggesting that our current understanding of microbial communities in TAD is still very limited. Although microorganisms have not been isolated in the
present study, it may be possible to predict their metabolic
capabilities based on those phylogenetically closely related
isolates (Bond et al. 2000).
Important bacterial genera and species
Coprothermobacter was the most abundant genus in DSDT,
but this phylotype demonstrated much less relative abundance
in DSD0. Coprothermobacter-related species have been isolated from sludge previously. For instance, Coprothermobacter
platensis was an anaerobic proteolytic thermophilic bacterium
isolated from anaerobic mesophilic sludge (Etchebehere et al.
1998). In another study, Wrighton et al. (2008) isolated
Coprothermobacter from thermophilic microbial fuel cells. In
this study, Coprothermobacter was closely related to
Coprothermobacter proteolyticus, which was isolated from
biokitchen wastes digested by a dry anaerobic composting process (DRANCO) under thermophilic conditions (55 °C)
(Kersters et al. 1994). The optimal temperature for this
species was 65–70 °C. C. proteolyticus was able to utilize

10279

proteinaceous materials (Sasaki et al. 2011) and oleate under
thermophilic conditions (Menes et al. 2001). All these observations indicated Coprothermobacter species may play a significant role for digesting organic compounds in TAD. Other genera including Syntrophus, Dermatophilus, Azoarcus, and
Crocinitomix occurred at relatively high abundances in DSDT.
Members of the genera Bacillus, Haloplasma,
Ruminiclostridium, Proteiniphilum, Clostridiisalibacter, and
Caldicoprobacter occurred at high levels in SWDT. Among
these genera, Bacillus, Haloplasma, Clostridiisalibacter, and
Caldicoprobacter increased their relative abundances in
SWDT as compared to SWD0. Bacillus was the most abundant
genus (23.22 %) in SWDT but only accounted for 0.1 % in
SWD0, indicating that a temperature increase remarkably facilitated the growth of Bacillus species. In the current study,
Bacillus-related sequences were closely related to Bacillus
infernus. B. infernus was able to reduce Fe(III) with formate
and lactate as electron donor at temperatures from 40 to 65 °C
(Boone et al. 1995). In addition, B. infernus has been frequently
detected in TAD (Cheon et al. 2007; Merlino et al. 2013; Park
et al. 2008). The dominance of B. infernus in thermophilic
manure samples implied its important role in TAD. Other genera, such as Haloplasma, Clostridiisalibacter, and
Caldicoprobacter increased their abundances with temperature
increase, suggesting that they may contain thermophilic microorganisms. Consistently, Haloplasma spp. were previously detected in thermophilic biogas reactors fed with different agricultural waste materials (Ziganshin et al. 2013), two-phase biogas reactor (Rademacher et al. 2012), a thermophilic anaerobic
digester (Hori et al. 2014), and aerated cattle manure
composting piles (Maeda et al. 2010). Clostridiisalibacter
paucivorans have been detected in deep-sea hydrothermal environments (Jiang et al. 2015).Caldicoprobacter contained several thermophilic species, such as Caldicoprobacter oshimai
(Yokoyama et al. 2010), Caldicoprobacter algeriensis
(Bouanane-Darenfed et al. 2011) and Caldicoprobacter
guelmensis ( Bouanane-Darenfed et al. 2013). The detection
of various microorganisms indicated that TAD might be mediated by a suite of thermophiles.
Important archaeal genera and species
Methanobacterium was the most abundant (91.2 % of total
archaeal reads) archaeal genus in DSDT but reduced its abundance to 37.7 % in DSD0. The remarkable enrichment under
thermophilic conditions indicated that the high temperature
might facilitate the growth of Methanobacterium-related archaea. Most Methanobacterium-related sequences were closely
related to Methanobacterium subterraneum. M. subterraneum
was an alkaliphilic, eurythermic, and halotolerant methanogen,
which was first isolated from deep granitic groundwater
(Kotelnikova et al. 1998). Methanobacterium also contained
some thermophilic species such as Methanobacterium

10280

thermoautotrophicus isolated from sludge (Zeikus and Wolee
1972), Methanobacterium wolfei isolated from sludge and river
sediments (Winter et al. 1984) and Methanobacterium
thermoalcaliphilum isolated from a biogas plant (Blotevogel
et al. 1985). All these observations suggested that
Methanobacterium species have been frequently encountered
in sludge under thermophilic conditions.
A different scenario was observed in manure samples.
Methanothermobacter spp. significantly raised their abundances from 0.9 % in SWD0 to 47.9 % in SWDT. This remarkable difference indicated Methanothermobacter might
adapt to thermophilic conditions and outcompete other
methanogens. The genus Methanothermobacter was proposed early in 2000 (Wasserfallen et al. 2000). Our experimental results indicated that most Methanothermobacter-related sequences were closely related to
Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicum, accounting for
47.5 % in SWDT. M. thermoautotrophicum (formerly
M e t h a n o b a c t e r i u m t h e r m o a u t o t ro p h i c u m ) i s a
lithoautotrophic and thermophilic archaeon (Zeikus and
Wolee 1972), which was first isolated from sewage sludge in
1971. It has been frequently detected in anaerobic digestion
processes (Luo and Angelidaki 2013), including some thermophilic digestion studies (Tada et al. 2006; Ueno and Tatara
2008). Overall, the enrichment of Methanobacterium and
Methanothermobacter species in thermophilic conditions suggested their importance in producing methane in TAD.
Important fungal phylotypes
Compared to bacterial and archaeal communities, fungal communities in TAD have been less addressed in the previous
studies. In the current study, Illumina sequencing offered an
opportunity to systematically characterize the shift of fungal
communities from 37 to 58 °C in anaerobic digestion.
Ascomycota was the most dominant phylum in thermophilic
samples, accounting for 82.5 % of total reads of DSFT and
SWFT. Ritari et al. (2012) utilized pyrosequencing analysis to
characterize the fungal communities in MAD and TAD. Only
two phyla including Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were detected in that study and the Ascomycota-related sequences
represented almost 99 % of the fungal sequences (Ritari
et al. 2012). All these observations indicated Ascomycota
probably contained members that were able to thrive in thermophilic conditions.
A phylogenetically wide spectrum of different fungal genera significantly increased their relative abundances in thermophilic conditions, suggesting their adaption to thermal environments. Another notable observation was that various
fungal genera were enriched from different inocula. In sludge
samples, Candida and Dipodascus seemed to prefer elevated
thermophilic temperatures. In manure samples, Alternaria,
Cladosporium, Penicillium, Hypocrea, and Epicoccum were

Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2015) 99:10271–10282

found mostly or exclusively in thermophilic conditions. Numerous other fungal genera increased their abundances at elevated temperatures, but to a lesser extent. Among the
enriched genera, many have been identified as thermophilic
fungi such as Candida (Shin et al. 2001), Dipodascaceae
(Hultman et al. 2010), Alternaria (Craveri et al. 1972), and
Cladosporium (Ghazifard et al. 2001).
It is notable that thermophilic microcosms contained more
fungal diversity than mesophilic microcosms. In accordance
with our observation, Ritari et al. (2012) also found a more
diverse fungal community in thermophilic digesters than in
mesophilic digesters. Unlike bacteria, fungi are often able to
thrive under extreme environments such as low nutrient availability, low pH, and low moisture (Buchan et al. 2003; de Boer
et al. 2005; Margesin et al. 2005). Among these enriched
fungal genera, many were capable of degrading organic compounds. For instance, Candida and Penicillium contained species that were able to degrade lignin and cellulose (Kirk and
Farrell 1987; Kuhar et al. 2008; Wood and Garcia-Campayo
1991). This observation indicated that fungi might play an
important ecological role in thermophilic digestion by
degrading more complex organic compounds.
In summary, high-throughput Illumina sequencing was
employed to characterize the shift in microbial communities
during a transition from mesophilic digestion to thermophilic
digestion. Our results showed that the bacterial, archaeal, and
fungal community compositions changed dramatically, indicating that temperature was an important factor in shaping the
microbial communities inhabiting the AD process. In addition, microbial community compositions differed significantly
between samples inoculated from sludge and manure, suggesting that source of inoculum was probably another important factor in shaping the thermophilic microbial communities.
A phylogenetically wide spectrum of phylotypes was enriched
in thermophilic conditions, indicating that TAD might be mediated by a suite of thermophiles. Among them, many have
been classified as thermophilic microorganisms. However,
others have rarely been detected in thermophilic conditions,
indicating the relatively broad phylogenetic coverage of highthroughput sequencing. Also, our experimental results demonstrated that a more diverse fungal community was found in
TAD than in MAD. Further investigations are needed to isolate thermophiles to test their metabolic capabilities in TAD,
as well as to profile the metagenomics for understanding the
metabolic potentials of bacteria, archaea, and fungi in thermophilic conditions.

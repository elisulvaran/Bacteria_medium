A Gram-staining-negative, thin rod-shaped, anaerobic bacterium designated MCWD3T was isolated from sediment of
the deep sea in Ulleung Basin, East Sea, Korea. The ranges of
temperature, pH and NaCl for growth of this strain were 15â€“
40Â°C (optimum 29Â°C), 5.0â€“10.0 (optimum pH 6.5), and 1â€“5%,
respectively. The major fatty acids were iso-C15:0 (30%) and
iso-C15:0 dimethyl acetal (17%). The major polar lipids were
diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and unidentified aminophospholipids, phospholipids, and aminolipids. The fermentation product from
yeast extract was acetate. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S
rRNA genes indicated that the isolate was related to Sporosalibacterium faouarense (92.8% sequence identity), Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans (92.6%), and Brassicibacter mesophilus
(92.4%). However, the isolate was differentiated from these
genera by both physiological and chemotaxonomical properties. On the basis of a polyphasic taxonomic analysis, we
propose that MCWD3T represents a novel taxon with the
name Abyssisolibacter fermentans gen. nov. sp. nov.

Introduction
Diverse microbes are present in the various deep seabed environments despite the extreme conditions of low temperature, high pressure and low nutrient availability (JÃ¸rgensen
and Boetius, 2007). Recent ocean drilling projects have provided more insights into the microbial systems in the deepsea sediments. Analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences
have uncovered specific microbiomes (Zhu et al., 2013; Polymenakou et al., 2015) as well prokaryotes phylogenetically
distant from those in other habitats (Marchesi et al., 2001;
Reed et al,. 2002). While these investigations have provided

more information about the deep-sea microbiome, full understanding for deep sea microbes is still limited by the scarcity of cultivated strains and information about their properties (Teske, 2006; Da Silva et al., 2013).
The order Clostridiales, is a large and diverse phylogenetic
group that includes species with a wide range of morphologies, habitats and physiologies (Cato et al., 1986). The family
Clostridiaceae belongs to this order and contains 37 genera as
well as a number of unclassified species (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Taxonomy/). In the last decade, a number of isolates
have been described that represent novel genera in this family
(Liebgott et al., 2008; Rezgui et al., 2011; Fang et al., 2012;
Hania et al., 2015a). We isolated another member of the family Clostridiaceae from deep-sea sediment in Ulleung Basin,
East Sea, Korea. A polyphasic analysis of its growth properties,
chemotaxonomy, and phylogeny demonstrated that this
isolate represents a novel species and genus in the family.

Isolation and growth of strain MCWD3

Strain MCWD3T was isolated from the deep sea sediment
(water depth 2,150 m) located in the Ulleung Basin (37Â°00í¿N,
131Â°00í¿E). The samples were acquired by a 4 m long piston
core sampler with polycarbonate liner (Ï•=13 cm). Subsamples
were obtained from 0.5, 50, 100, 150, and 200 cm depths by
a modified 3 ml plastic syringe. The subsamples, 0.5 cm3,
were mixed with 10 ml of anaerobic medium (DSMZ No. 135)
on shipboard. Following transportation to the laboratory,
0.5 ml of culture broth was transferred into a new medium
(10 ml) composed of (g/L): K2HPO4 0.14, NH4Cl 0.5, FeSO4
0.017, KCl 0.34, MgCl2Â·6H2O 2.8, MgSO4Â·7H2O 3.45, CaCl2Â·
2H2O 0.14, NaCl 22, trace mineral solution (Balch, 1979) 1 ml,
vitamin solution (Balch, 1979) 1 ml, resazurin 1 mg, yeast extract 2, glucose 5, sodium acetate 1.4, cysteineÂ·H2OÂ·HCl 0.5,
NaHCO3 5.0, Na2SÂ·9H20 0.5. The sample was diluted and the
enrichment was performed at 30Â°C for 7 days. The highest
dilution showing growth was streaked into a slant of the same
medium with 1.5% agar. A resulting colony was selected for
further characterization. It was preserved as a glycerol suspension (15%, w/v) at â€“80Â°C and deposited at KCTC (Korean
Collection for Type Cultures, No. KCTC 15524) and CCTCC
(under deposit). All of media for this study were prepared by
the Hungate anaerobic techniques (Hungate, 1969). Unless
otherwise stated, strain MCWD3T was cultivated at 30Â°C.
Phylogenetic analysis
Extraction of genomic DNA from strain MCWD3T was con-

348

Kim et al.

ducted using a commercial Exgene cell SV kit (GeneAll
Biotechnology), and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with
bacterial primers 27F and 1492R. The PCR product was sequenced at Cosmogentech Inc. The GenBank accession number is KU510224. To ascertain the phylogenetic position of
strain MCWD3T, the 16S rRNA gene sequence was compared
with those obtained from EzTaxon (http://eztaxon-e.ezbiocloud.net/). A total of 1,343 unambiguously aligned sequences
were compared. Phylogenetic tree using the Jukes-Cantor
model and neighbor-joining (NJ) method was constructed
by the MEGA ver. 5.2 (Tamura et al., 2011). The resulting
tree topologies were evaluated using bootstrap analyses based
on 1,000 resamplings. Phylogenetic analysis based on maximum-likelihood (ML) and maximum-parsimony (MP) methods were also conducted in MEGA.
Morphological, physiological, and biochemical characterization
Gram type was examined by utilizing Gram staining kit (YD
diagnostics). Morphology and motility were observed by light
microscopy at Ã— 1,000 (Nikon). The oxygen resistance was
assessed by cultivation with air in the absence of Na2S and
cysteine. To examine growth temperature ranges, cultures
were incubated at 4, 10, 15, 20, 25, 29, 33, 37, 40, and 44Â°C.
The pH range for was determined at pH values of 4.0, 5.0,
6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, and 10.0 by the addition of 10
mM of buffer. The buffers and pH ranges use were by MES
(pH 4.0â€“6.0), HEPES (pH 6.0â€“8.0) and AMPSO (pH 8.0â€“
10.0) (Yang et al., 2013) instead of bicarbonate buffer. Salinity
range for growth was examined by the addition of NaCl to
final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and
10.0%. The effect of yeast extract on growth was tested at 0,
0.05, 0.1, and 0.2%. Endospore formation was checked by
the pasteurization test, and the strains were treated at 80Â°C,
90Â°C and 100Â°C for 10 or 20 minutes before being transferred
into fresh medium (Hania et al., 2015b).
Type strain Sporosalibacterium faouarense SOL3f37T (Rezgui
et al., 2011) was obtained from KCTC (No. 15135) and cultivated with the medium (No. 987) recommended by the

institute.
The basal medium for the substrate utilization tests for strain
MCWD3T was prepared with (g/L): K2HPO4 0.3, KH2PO4
0.3, NH4Cl 1.0, MgCl2Â·6H2O 2.0, KCl 0.1, CaCl2Â·2H2O 0.1,
NaCl 10.0, trace mineral solution 10 ml, yeast extract 0.5,
resazurin 0.1% (w/v), NaHCO3 0.2, cysteine-HCl 0.5 (pH
6.5). The organic acids (20 mM) tested were sodium formate,
sodium acetate, sodium propionate, sodium butyrate, sodium
fumarate, sodium malate, sodium succinate, sodium lactate,
and sodium citrate. The amino acids (20 mM) tested were alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine,
glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine,
methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine. The carbohydrates (20 mM) tested
were arabinose, cellobiose, fructose, glucose, glycerol, lactose,
maltose, mannose, and mannitol. In addition, H2+CO2 gas
(80:20 v:v, 1 bar), peptone (0.1%), and casamino acids (0.1%)
were tested. The basal medium for Sporosalibacterium faouaT
rense SOL3f37 was prepared with the previous composition (Rezgui et al., 2011) containing 0.05% yeast extract.
To examine if sulfur compounds can be served as electron
acceptors, potassium sulfate (20 mM), sodium thiosulfate (20
mM), and elemental sulfur (0.1%) were added into each yeast
extract (0.05%) containing medium prepared in the absence
of Na2S. Hydrogen sulfide concentration of each sample was
photometrically estimated from colloidal CuS (Cord-Ruwisch,
1985). The reduction of nitrate and nitrite was inspected by
utilizing Durham tubes (Ogg and Patel, 2009) and color changes
with the Griess reagents (Conn and Breed, 1919; MacFaddin,
2000). The end product from the metabolism was confirmed
by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an ion
exclusion coloumn (Shodex RSpak KC81), which was operated at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and 40Â°C.

ing to the manufacturerâ€™s instruction with cells cultivated for
7 days. Polar lipids were extracted as described by Minnikin
et al. (1984) and analyzed by 2-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (TLC; Minnikin et al.,1984; Komagata and Suzuki, 1987). To stain the total lipids, phospholipid, aminolipid, glycolipid and complex lipid, molybdophosphoric acid,
molybdenum blue, ninhydrin, and Î±-naphthol and sulfuric
acid were sprayed, respectively. Detailed procedure was described in Yang et al. (2013).
Results and Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis
T

The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain MCWD3 revealed that
it was affiliated with the family Clostridiaceae of the order
Clostridiales. The most closely related strains were SporosaliT
bacterium faouarense SOL3F37 (92.7% sequence identity;
Rezgui et al., 2011), Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans 37HS60T
(92.6%; Liebgott et al., 2008), and Brassicibacter mesophilus
T
BM (92.4%; Fang et al., 2012). In the phylogenetic tree con-

structed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method, strain MCWD3
grouped within the clade containing the genera Sporosalibacterium, Clostridiisalibacter, Brassicibacter, Caloranaerobacter, and Caldisalinibacter (Fig 1). The analysis also indicated that strain MCWD3T was not closely affiliated with any
other previously described genus.
Morphology and physiological characteristics
T

Strain MCWD3 stained Gram-negative and formed thin,
long rods (0.7 Î¼m Ã— 5-23 Î¼m). Under the microscope, cells
were motile. The colonies were yellow, circular and smooth.
No growth was observed in air, indication that it was a strict
anaerobe. Growth occurred at 15â€“40Â°C (optimum 29Â°C) and
pH 4.0â€“10.0 (optimum pH 6.5). NaCl was required at range
of 1â€“5% NaCl (w/v, optimum 2%) for growth (Table 1). The
pasteurization test resulted in successful re-growth even after
incubation at 100Â°C for 20 min, indicating thermoresistant
endospores were formed.
Yeast extract was required for growth even in the presence
of other carbon sources. Casamino acids and peptone did
not stimulate growth. The colorimetric test indicated that

elemental sulfur, sulfate and thiosulfate were not reduced
by the strain. The nitrate/nitrite reduction assay showed nitrogen compounds were not reduced by strain MCWD3T.
Fructose, cellobiose, mannose, and methionine stimulated
growth in the presence of yeast extract, but none of the other
organic acids, amino acids or carbohydrates tested were stimulatory, which are different characteristics from other closely related species including S. faouarense SOL3f3T (Table 1).
The HPLC assay confirmed acetate was a fermentation product from the yeast extract, and other organic acids such as
formate, propionate, and butyrate were not detected.
These physiological properties distinguished strain MCWD3T
from other members of this clade. It stains Gram negative
while C. paucivorans 37HS60T, S. faouarense SOL3f37T and
Csb. kiririmariensis L21-TH-D2, stain Gram positive. It is
mesophilic and fails to grow at temperatures > 40Â°C, distinguishing it from Cab. azorensis MV1087T (Wery et al.,
2001) and Csb. kiririmariensis L21-TH-D2T (Hania et al.,
T
2015a). Unlike S. faouarense SOL3f37 (Rezgui et al., 2011)
T
and Csb. kiririmariensis L21-TH-D2 , strain MCWD3T does
not tolerate high concentrations of NaCl. In addition, the
T
pattern of substrates utilized by strain MCWD3 differs from
that of all the other species.

Chemotaxonomy
According to the draft genome sequence of strain MCWD3T
(LOHE00000000.1), the DNA G+C content is 28.8 mol%.
The predominant fatty acid components (> 5%) are iso-C13:0
(5.4%), iso-C15:0 (30%), antesio-C15:0 (7.6%), C15:0 (5.0%), isoC15:0 DMA (16.9%), summed feature 5 (C15:0 DMA and/or
C14:0 3OH, 9.7%), and C16:0 DMA (5.2%) (Table 2). The dominance of the iso-C15:0 and iso-C15:0 DMA are also reported
for other genera in the clade. The polar lipid profiles of strain
MCWD3T included diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and
an unidentified lipid, two unidentified phospholipids (PL)
and aminolipids (AL), and five unidentified aminophospholipids (APL) (Supplementary data Fig. S1). In the Cts. pauT
civorans 37HS60 (Liebgott et al., 2008), PG and PE were
detected, but DPG was not. The presence of DPG, PG and
PE is also reported for S. faouarense SOL3F37T (Rezgui et al.,
T
2011) and B. mesophilus BM (Fang et al., 2012), but amount
of DPG appears to be higher than the PG and PE, which is
different from MCWD3T.

taxonomic analyses indicate that strain MCWD3 is distinct
from members of other genera in the family Clostridiaceae.
Thus, we propose that strain MCWD3T is a novel species in
a new genus with the name Abyssisolibacter fermentans.

Ferment a few carbohydrates and amino acids. The major
cellular fatty acids are iso-C15:0 and iso-C15:0 DMA and polar
lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and several unidentified species. The
DNA G+C content is approx. 29 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis
suggests that this genus belongs to the family Clostridiaceae.
The type species is Abyssisolibacter fermentans.
Description of Abyssisolibacter fermentans sp. nov. fermentans (fer.menâ€™tans. L. part. adj. fermentans fermenting)
Cells are long thin rods, size of 0.7 Ã— 5.0â€“23.0 Î¼m. Colonies
were bright yellow, circular and smooth. The temperature
for growth is 15â€“40Â°C (optimum 29Â°C), and the pH range
is 6.0â€“9.0 (optimum pH 6.5). Requires 1â€“5% (w/v) NaCl for
growth, with an optimum at 2.0%. The fermentation product
from yeast extract broth is acetate. It is heterotrophic, CO2
was not used as carbon source. Cells are not capable of reducing elemental sulfur, sulfate and thiosulfate. Cells metabolize fructose, mannose, cellobiose and methionine in
the presence of yeast extract (0.5 g/L). The major fatty acids
identified were C15:0, iso-C15:0, anteiso-C15:0, C16:0 DMA, isoC15:0 DMA, anteiso-C15:0 DMA, Summed feature 4 (comprised
with C15:2 and/or C15:1 cis7) and Summed feature 5 (C15:0 DMA
and/or C14:0 3OH). In addition to the genus description, two
unknown phospholipids, two unknown aminolipids, and five
unknown aminophospholipids were present. The type strain,
T

A moderately halophilic, strictly anaerobic bacterium, designated 37HS60T, was isolated from an
olive mill wastewater in southern Morocco (Marrakesh). The cells were straight, motile and stained
Gram-positive, forming spherical and terminal spores and with an atypical thick and stratified
multilayered cell wall. Major fatty acid components were iso-C17 : 1v10c or anteiso-C17 : 1v3c
(19.3 %), C14 : 0 (14.3 %), C16 : 1v7c (9.9 %), C16 : 1v7c DMA (8.5 %) and C16 : 0 (7.6 %).
Strain 37HS60T grew from 20 to 50 6C with an optimum at 40–45 6C, and growth was observed
from pH 5.5 to 8.5 with an optimum of 6.8. The salinity range for growth was 10–100 g NaCl l”1
with an optimum at 50 g NaCl l”1. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences
revealed that strain 37HS60T fell within the evolutionary radiation enclosed by cluster XII of
the Clostridium subphylum. Strain 37HS60T exhibited highest 16S rRNA gene sequence
similarity of 92.0 % with Caloranaerobacter azorensis and 90.6 % with Clostridium purinilyticum.
Moreover, 37HS60T did not grow on basal medium with hexose or pentose sugars as carbon and
energy sources. Pyruvate, fumarate and succinate were the best substrates for 37HS60T
growth with 1.0 g yeast extract l”1. The DNA G+C content was 33.0 mol%. Due to its
phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, isolate 37HS60T is proposed as a novel species of a
new genus, Clostridiisalibacter paucivorans gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain is 37HS60T
(5JCM 14354T5CCUG 53849T).

Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is a major environmental
problem in the Mediterranean region, where more than
36107 m3 of this residue is produced annually. OMW
presents a high organic load, including sugars, tannins,
polyphenols, polyalcohols, pectins, lipids and a wide
variety of simple aromatic compounds resulting from olive
cell-wall degradation during the oil extraction process
(Balice & Cera, 1984; Hamdi, 1993; Labat et al., 2000;
Lesage-Meesen et al., 2001). This effluent is discharged
directly into sewage systems and water streams, despite the
fact that such disposal methods are prohibited in many
Mediterranean countries. This is due to the current lack of

appropriate alternative technologies to treat OMW properly, mainly in the south of the region. In many countries,
such as Morocco, OMW is directly rejected into evaporation ponds without any complementary treatment.
Microbiological studies on OMW or digesters treating
these wastes have revealed the presence of metabolically
diverse anaerobic bacteria (Mechichi et al., 1998, 1999a, b,
2000; Chamkha et al., 2001a, b; Thabet et al., 2004), all of
which are anaerobic species belonging to the order
Clostridiales and affiliated to the genus Clostridium. This
genus has been defined as containing Gram-positive,
anaerobic, rod-shaped and spore-forming bacteria unable
to carry out dissimilatory sulfate reduction (Cato et al.,
1986; Hippe et al., 1992). Collins et al. (1994) used rDNA
phylogenetic analysis to define 15 clusters within the genus
Clostridium, and they subsequently proposed five new

genera: Caloramator, Filifactor, Moorella, Oxobacter and
Oxalophagus. Phylogenetically, however, the genus still
embraces a high number of organisms from many different
genera that are not defined by Clostridium-specific
phenotypes (Cato & Stackebrandt, 1989; Lawson et al.,
1993; Rainey & Stackebrandt, 1993; Rainey et al., 1993;
Collins et al., 1994; Stackebrandt & Rainey, 1997;
Stackebrandt et al., 1999; Stackebrandt & Hippe, 2001).
Despite some reclassification, the genus Clostridium
remains a phylogenetically heterogeneous entity, containing a core cluster (I) of more than 60 species, while the
remaining species form several independent phylogenetic
lineages, in which species are sometimes closely related to
organisms which are classified in different genera. Cluster
XII, for example, recognized as being phenotypically
incoherent, contains four Clostridium species, closely
related to other genera such as Tissierella (Farrow et al.,
1995), Thermohalobacter (Cayol et al., 2000), Caloranaerobacter (Wery et al., 2001), Sporanaerobacter (HernandezEugenio et al., 2002), Sedimentibacter (Breitenstein et al.,
2002), Soehngenia (Parshina et al., 2003) and Garciella
(Miranda-Tello et al., 2003). These genera, isolated from
diverse environments, include non-spore-forming, Gramnegative and -positive bacteria. In cluster XII, the species
are either mesophilic or thermophilic, and even halophilic.
Here, we describe a novel species of a novel genus
belonging to the order Clostridiales, cluster XII, which is
an anaerobic, mesophilic, halophilic, heterotrophic, sporeforming bacterium, isolated from an OMW evaporation
pond located in Marrakesh, Morocco. Formerly, these
ponds were old underground galleries, called khettaras,
which brought water for irrigation of the desert. Nowadays
they are used as reserve ponds for different agroindustrial
effluents.
Samples were collected at a depth of 6 m, using a single
tube with a specific stem to collect each sample of
sediment. The mud was transferred (i) into 50 ml serum
vials closed with butyl rubber stoppers then stored at 4 uC,
and (ii) into 1.8 ml cryotubes containing 2 % glycerol
(v/v), added as a cryoprotectant, then stored at 220 uC
until processing.
The Hungate technique (Hungate, 1969) was used
throughout the isolation procedure and the physiological
and metabolic characterization. The basal medium contained (l21): 0.3 g KH2PO4, 0.3 g K2HPO4, 1.0 g NH4Cl,
50 g NaCl, 0.1 g KCl, 0.1 g CaCl2 . 2H2O, 10 ml trace
mineral element solution (Balch et al., 1979) and 1 ml
0.1 % (w/v) resazurin. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with
10 M KOH. The basal medium was boiled under a stream
of O2-free N2 gas, cooled to room temperature, and 5 ml
aliquots were distributed into Hungate tubes under a
stream of O2-free N2 gas. The N2 gas phase was replaced
with N2/CO2 (80 : 20) and the tubes were autoclaved. Prior
to inoculation, 0.05 ml Na2S . 9H2O (2 %, w/v), 0.1 ml
NaHCO3 (10 %, w/v) and 0.1 ml MgCl2 . 6H2O (150 g l21)
were added. To initiate enrichment cultures, a small part of
62

the sediment sample was inoculated into the growth
medium, followed by incubation at 37 uC without agitation.
Positive enrichment cultures were obtained after 7 days
incubation at 37 uC, and microscopic examination revealed
the presence of motile, rod-shaped bacteria. The culture was
then purified by repeated use of the Hungate roll tube
method (Hungate, 1969). Single colonies (0.8–1.0 mm
diam.), which developed in the roll tubes after 96 h
incubation at 37 uC, were picked up and tenfold serial
dilutions were performed in the roll tubes at least twice
before the culture was considered to be pure. Several axenic
cultures were obtained using this procedure, and one strain,
named 37HS60T, was used for further characterization.
Strain 37HS60T was a straight, thin, long rod
(0.5 mm63.0–8.0 mm), motile by means of peritrichous
flagella (Fig. 1a), that stained Gram-positive and formed
spherical and terminal spores (Fig. 1b) which appeared
mainly in old cultures. However, ultrathin sections
obtained as described by Fardeau et al., (1997) showed
an atypical, well-contrasted, Gram-positive-type cell wall.
It exhibited a thick and stratified cell wall composed of
dense multilayers, including a cytoplasmic membrane and
an atypical thick and multilayered peptidoglycan, covered
by an S-layer (Fig. 1c). Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)
were analysed at the CCUG (Göteborg, Sweden) using the
Microbial Identification System (Microbial ID), and strain
37HS60T was compared to the available fatty acid database.
For FAME analysis, bacteria were grown on marine agar at
37 uC. 37HS60T has an original cellular fatty acid profile,
containing large amounts of saturated and unsatured fatty
acids. The fatty acids detected were iso-C17 : 1v10c or
anteiso-C17 : 1v3c (19.3 %), C14 : 0 (14.3 %), C16 : 1v7c
(9.9 %), C16 : 1v7c DMA (8.5 %), C16 : 0 (7.6 %) and a
weak proportion of diverse fatty acids (Table 1). A large
proportion of both the major and weak fatty acids, as well
as unknown fatty acids which are listed in Table 1, are
rarely encountered and this atypical profile was unexpected
for a Gram-positive bacterium.
Optimal growth conditions for strain 37HS60T were
determined in duplicate experiments performed in basal
medium containing yeast extract (0.1 g l21) as described
by Fardeau et al. (2000). Strain 37HS60T was strictly
anaerobic. The optimal temperature for growth was 42 uC
(range 25–50 uC); growth was not observed at 20 or 55 uC.
For pH studies, the medium was adjusted to the desired pH
using anaerobically prepared stock solutions of NaHCO3
(10 %) or Na2CO3 (8 %). The optimum pH was 6.8 (range
5.6–8.4). For studies of NaCl requirements, NaCl was
weighed directly into the tubes for concentrations ranging
from 0 to 200 g NaCl l21 before dispensing basal medium
without NaCl. Strain 37HS60T required salt for growth
(range 10–100 g NaCl l21), with an optimum of 50 g l21.
Substrate utilization was studied in the presence of 0.1 g
yeast extract l21 added to the basal medium. Only three
organic acids (20 mM) were used as carbon and energy
sources: succinate, fumarate and pyruvate. Succinate was

lysine and serine, and isobutyrate was formed from valine.
Other amino acids, such as threonine, glycine, proline,
tyrosine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, alanine, arginine, tryptophan, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamine
glutamic acid, methionine and histidine did not support
growth.
Sulfate, thiosulfate, sulfite and elemental sulfur were
separately added to the growth medium at final concentrations of 20 mM, 20 mM, 2 mM and 0.1 % (w/v),
respectively, for potential use as an electron sink. Nitrate
and nitrite utilization tests were carried out in triplicate, in
butyl-capped Hungate tubes filled with 5 ml pre-reduced
medium (without resazurin and Na2S) distributed under
a nitrogen atmosphere. NaNO3 (10 mM) or NaNO2
(10 mM) were added to the tubes immediately before
inoculation (10 %, v/v). These tests were realized under
similar conditions without pre-reducing the medium and
without a nitrogen atmosphere to measure oxygen
utilization.
Sulfate (20 mM), thiosulfate (20 mM), elemental sulfur
(0.1 %), sulfite (2 mM), nitrate (20 mM) nitrite (2 mM)
and oxygen were not used as electron acceptors. The sulfur
test was realized photometrically as collodial CuS (Fardeau
et al., 1997), and the nitrate or nitrite reduction were
assayed by using specific sticks (Quantofix; Machelez
Nagel).
Growth of strain 37HS60T was inhibited by the addition of
three different classes of antibiotic compounds: chloramphenicol (25 mg ml21), penicillin G (300 mg ml21) and
streptomycin (150 mg ml21).

slowly reduced to succinate. End products from pyruvate
fermentation were acetate, H2 and CO2. Cellobiose,
cellulose, fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose,
mannose, ribose, sucrose, xylose, glycerol, mannitol,
ethanol, methanol, acetate, propionate, lactate, citrate,
xylan and starch were not used.

Genomic DNA of 37HS60T was extracted using the Wizard
Genomic DNA Purification kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). The universal primers Fd1
(59CAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-39) and R6 (59TACGGTTACCTTGTTACGAC-39) were used to amplify
the SSU rRNA gene. The nucleotide sequence (1430 bases)
was manually aligned, using the sequence alignment editor
BioEdit (Hall, 1999). Reference sequences were obtained
from the Ribosomal Database Project II (Maidak et al.,
2001) and GenBank databases (Benson et al., 1999). The
pairwise evolutionary distances based on 1281 unambiguous nucleotides were computed by the Jukes & Cantor (1969)
method. The phylogenetic tree obtained by the neighbourjoining method (Saitou & Nei, 1987) is shown in Fig. 2. Its
topology was also supported by using the maximumparsimony and maximum-likelihood algorithms.

Strain 37HS60T grew heterotrophically on peptone,
biotrypticase, and Casamino acids (1.0 g l21). The
Stickland reaction was negative, but four amino acids
(20 mM) were used: acetate was formed from cystein,

The most closely related sequences were found in members
of cluster XII within the order Clostridiales (Collins et al.,
1994). Most of the related species originated from different
environments. The closest phylogenetically described

strains were Caloranaerobacter azorensis DSM 13643T
(92.0 % similarity), isolated from a deep-sea hydrothermal
vent (Wery et al., 2001), and Clostridium purinilyticum
DSM 1384T, isolated from soils exposed to chicken manure
and from sewage sludge enriched with adenine (90.6 %
similarity). Other related species that exhibited ,90 %
similarity were Clostridium acidurici ATCC 7906T and
Thermohalobacter berrensis CNCM 105955T (89.7 and
89.1 %, respectively). Apart from these species, only an
undescribed strain ‘Bacterium HY42-22’, retrieved from a
mud flat (accession no. DQ286650), exhibited a higher
level of similarity (99.0 %). According to its phylogenetic
position and the value accepted as the criterion for the
delineation of different species (Stackebrandt & Goebel,
1994), our novel isolate probably represents a novel species
and a novel genus in cluster XII of the Clostridiales, since its

phylogenetic distance was equal to or lower than 92.0 %
from Caloranaerobacter azorensis DSM 13643T and
Clostridium purinilyticum DSM 1384T.
This is strongly supported by important differences in
genetic and physiological traits (Table 2). First, strain
37HS60T is an atypical Gram-positive bacterium, whereas
Caloranaerobacter azorensis has a characteristic Gramnegative cell wall, demonstrating a specific difference
between the structure of their respective envelopes. In
addition, the DNA G+C content of Caloranaerobacter
azorensis (27.0 mol%) is 6 mol% lower than strain
37HS60T. Equally, strain 37HS60T differs physiologically
from Caloranaerobacter azorensis in terms of carbohydrates
used, temperature and NaCl concentration ranges for
growth. Strain 37HS60T was able to grow at temperatures
up to 50 uC and is thermotolerant (optimum 42 uC),
although it was unable to grow at 55 uC, while C. azorensis
has an optimal temperature for growth of 65 uC. In
addition, unlike Caloranaerobacter azorensis, strain
37HS60T was unable to grow on starch or any other sugar
and unable to produce H2S from sulfur.
Secondly, strain 37HS60T differed from Clostridium
purinilyticum (Dürre et al., 1981) in terms of purine use,
temperature range and NaCl concentration for growth.
Strain 37HS60T was unable to grow without NaCl, whereas
Clostridium purinilyticum is not known to require sea salt
or NaCl. Moreover, the optimum growth temperature of
37HS60T (42 uC) is the maximal temperature for
Clostridium purinilyticum. Hence, Clostridium purinilyticum is a mesophilic, non-halophilic species, whereas strain
37HS60T is thermotolerant and moderately halophilic. In
addition, the DNA G+C content of Clostridium purinilyticum (29.0 %) is 4 mol% lower than strain 37HS60T. By
contrast, strain 37HS60T is not purinolytic and degrades
some amino acids, unlike Clostridium purinilyticum which
degrades only glycine.
Therefore, on the basis of the data reported here, we
propose that strain 37HS60T represents a novel species of a

C16 : 1v7c (9.9 %), C16 : 1v7c DMA (8.5 %), C16 : 0 (7.6 %)
and a weak proportion of diverse fatty acids. Growth occurs
between 25 and 50 uC (optimum 42 uC). Growth occurs in
the presence of NaCl at 10–100 g l21 (optimum 50 g l21).
The optimum pH for growth is 6.8, but growth occurs
between pH 5.5 and 8.5. Heterotrophic. Grows on yeast
extract, peptone, Bio-trypticase and Casamino acids. Cells
are unable to use sugars as carbon sources. Only the
following substrates are fermented in the presence of yeast

[Polyangium] brachysporum DSM7029 can produce glidobactin, which is a peptide-based proteasome
inhibitor that shows great potential as an anticancer drug. To better understand the glidobactin biosynthesis mechanism and to aid further studies of this strain, we report the annotated complete genome
sequence of DSM7029, which is 6,476,147 bp in length.

[Polyangium] brachysporum DSM 7029 (=K481-B101 = ATCC
53,080) was ﬁrst isolated from a soil sample in Greece (Oka et al.,
1988). This taxonomic name was not validly published at the time
of submission of the corresponding sequence entry or entries. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S ribosomal rRNA gene of strain DSM
7029 indicates that “Polyangium brachysporum” was misclassiﬁed
and should be placed in the Burkholderiales (Schellenberg et al.,
2007). Strain DSM 7029 can produce a novel type of antifungal and
antitumor antibiotic complex, consisting of glidobactins A–C (Oka
et al., 1988), which are hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetasepolyketide synthase (NRPS-PKS) natural products, as proteasome
inhibitors (Bian et al., 2014; Imker et al., 2010). Glidobactins
are acylated tripeptide derivatives that contain a 12-membered
ring structure consisting of two unique non-proteinogenic amino
acids, erythro-4-hydroxy-l-lysine and 4(S)-amino-2(E)-pentenoic
acid (Schellenberg et al., 2007). A structural difference between
glidobactins A–C was found only in their acyl side chain moiety
(Numata et al., 1988).
A total of 256,538 reads were generated using a Roche 454
GS FLX Titanium system and they were assembled using the

Newbler Program (version 2.7), which resulted in 71 contigs
(>500 bp) with an average size of 90,653 bp. The relationship
among contigs was displayed using ContigScape (Tang et al., 2013)
and conﬁrmed by PCR. Sanger-based sequencing was employed
to facilitate gap closing and to amend the low-quality regions
(scores <25). The ﬁnal sequence assembly was conducted using
the Phred/Phrap/Consed package. Finally, a consensus circular
sequence containing 6476,147 bp, with an estimated error rate
of <0.5 per 100,000 bases and providing 20.2-fold coverage, was
acquired.
Open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted by Glimmer 3.02
and GeneMark. The CDS annotation was based on the BLASTP
results obtained with the KEGG, NR databases and RAST server
(Aziz et al., 2008). At last, the annotation was checked by the NCBI
Prokaryotic Genomes Annotation Pipeline and manual correction
was also implemented. The average GC content of the chromosome
is 67.51%. The entire genome contains 5557 coding sequences, with
an average length of 1018 bp, 66 tRNA genes, and three complete
rRNA operons. Among the coding sequences (CDSs), biological functions could be deﬁned for 3999 (71.96%) of the predicted proteins,
while the other 1558 hypothetical proteins (28.04%) are homologous to conserved proteins of unknown function in other organisms
or have no match to any known proteins in the databases. Altogether, the CDSs and stable RNA genes represent 87.4% and 0.29%
of the genome, respectively. The genome features of DSM 7029 are
summarized in Table 1.

Glidobactin biosynthesis in DSM 7029 involves eight genes
(glbA-glbH). glbF and glbC encode a NRPS and a hybrid NRPS-PKS,
respectively, and they are required for the biosynthesis of the
tripeptide portion of glidobactins. We found that the glidobactin
gene cluster was located in the genome from nucleotides 2696,902
to 2675,407. The potential of DSM 7029 to produce secondary
metabolites was analyzed with the secondary metabolites predict
tool antiSMASH (Blin et al., 2013). There may be 14 putative gene
clusters involved in the biosynthesis of different natural products
(Table 1). Among the clusters, three encode NRPSs, two encode
hybrid NRPS-PKSs, one encodes a type I PKS, one is involved in
the biosynthesis of terpene, two are involved in the biosynthesis
of hserlactone, one is involved in lantipeptide production, one is
involved in ladderane production, one is involved in butyrolactone
production, one is involved in bacteriocin production, and one is
involved in the biosynthesis of aryl-polyene. Additionally, several
proteins have been shown to contribute to resistance against betalactam antibiotics. The genome sequence has a 20.3% DNA–DNA
hybridization (DDH) (Auch et al., 2010) value and a 75.13% average
nucleotide identity (ANI) (Richter and Rossello-Mora, 2009) value
vs. the closest complete genome Methylibium petroleiphilum PM1.

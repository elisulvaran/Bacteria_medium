Abstract—The influence of bacterial–humus preparations based on Gumigel (Agrosintez Company) on the
biological activity of soddypodzolic soil polluted with Pb(CH3COO)2 and gasoline was studied in a model
experiment. Some indicators of biological activity are shown to depend on soil pollution to different extents.
The process of nitrogen fixation and the activity of dehydrogenase and phosphatase were mostly inhibited by
Pb(CH3COO)2 and gasoline. Gasoline compared to Pb(CH3COO)2 inhibited the soil biological activity to a
greater extent. The bacterial–humus preparations exerted a significant positive effect on the biological activ
ity of the polluted soils manifested in the increase of the total number of bacteria and of the enzyme activity
(1.5–5.0 times), in the intensification of nitrogen fixation and denitrification (3–8 times), as well as in the
increase in the biomass of the plants grown (1.5–2.0 times). The application of bacterial suspensions of pure
cultures or the microbial complex without the preparations of humic acids did not always give a positive effect.

INTRODUCTION

intez Company) on the biological activity of soils pol
luted with oil products and heavy metals.

The continuously increasing anthropogenic impact
on the environment is accompanied by entering of
toxic compounds to ecosystems. Among the priority
pollutants are oil hydrocarbons and heavy metals.
Being accumulated in the soil, they determine its tox
icity for living organisms. Soils with a high content of
pollutants become unsuitable for the normal growth of
plants. The permanent increasing of the area of pol
luted lands makes the problem of their remediation
topical. The use of bacterial preparations based on
humic acids (bacterial–humus preparations) may be a
prospective method for the restoration of soil fertility.
The capability of humic acids to exhibit protective
properties relative to soil microorganisms and plants is
well known [3, 7, 10]. Humic acids can bind the toxi
cants into complexes unavailable for plants. They also
improve the physicochemical properties of soils. Bac
teria can decompose the organic pollutants (oil hydro
carbons, xenobiotics). The microbial biomass can sorb
heavy metals [2, 6, 11]. Microorganisms synthesize
the physiologically active substances stimulating the
growth of plants [4]. Bacterial–humus preparations
combine the properties of humic acids and bacterial
cultures. In addition, humic acids can also support the
viability of microorganisms in the preparation intro
duced into the soil [5, 12].
The objective of this work is to study the effect of
bacterial–humus preparations based on Gumigel (Agros

OBJECTS AND METHODS
The studies were conducted with two bacterial–
humus preparations representing a solution of potas
sium humate isolated from brown coal (Gumigel,
Agrosintez Company) enriched with the following:
(1) a mixture of pure Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas
bacterial cultures (further HA + BC), and (2) a complex
of microorganisms (HA + SC) isolated from a mucky–
gley soil (Training and Experimental Soil–Ecological
Center Chashnikovo, Moscow State University) and
containing bacteria of the Bacillus, Arthrobacter,
Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas, Cytophaga, Myxococcus,
and Aquaspirillum genera. Gumigel is a dark brown col
loidal gel of potassium humate with pH 7.0, a density of
1.1 g/cm3, and a mass humate fraction of 5%. The titer
of bacteria after the introduction of humate into the ini
tial preparation was 109 cell/mL. Model tests were per
formed in vessels with a volume of 0.3 L to study the
effect of the bacterial–humus preparations on the bio
logical activity of the soils. For the experiments, soddy
podzolic soils (Tomilino Forest Park, Moscow oblast)
were used. Gasoline AI95 at a concentration of 4% and
Pb(CH3COO)2 at a concentration of 5MPC were
applied as pollutants. The bacterial–humus prepara
tions (at the volume of 40 mL/kg) were added to the
soils. In order to determine the contribution of the
humic and bacterial components to the biological activ

ity of the soils, experiments with the application of
bacterial Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas suspensions,
suspensions of the microbial complex from the
mucky–gley soil (the bacterial titer is 109 cell/ml),
and a sterile preparation of humic acid (Gumigel)
were performed. The soil without gasoline and
Pb(CH3COO)2 was used as a control. A total of
18 variants were tested in the model experiment:
(1) C—the control soil; (2) HA—the soil with the
application of sterile humic acid; (3) BS—the soil
with the application of Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas
bacterial suspensions; (4) MC—the soil with the appli
cation of the microbial complex of the mucky–gley soil;
(5) HA + BS—the soil with the application of humic
acids enriched with Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas
bacteria; (6) HA + MC—the soil with the application
of humic acids enriched with the microbial complex of
the mucky–gley soil; (7) Pb—the soil contaminated
with Pb(CH3COO)2; (8) Pb + HA—the soil contami
nated with Pb(CH3COO)2 and sterile humic acid;
(9) Pb + BS—the soil contaminated with
Pb(CH3COO)2 and the application of Rhodococcus
and Pseudomonas bacterial suspensions; (10) Pb +
MC—the soil contaminated with Pb(CH3COO)2
and the application of the microbial complex of the
mucky–gley soil; (11) Pb + HA + BS—the soil con
taminated with Pb(CH3COO)2 and the application of
the humic acid preparation enriched with Rhodococcus
and Pseudomonas bacteria; (12) Pb + HA + MC—the
soil contaminated with Pb(CH3COO)2 and the applica
tion of the humic the humic acid preparation enriched
with the microbial complex of the mucky–gley soil;
(13) G—the soil contaminated with gasoline; (14) G +
HA—the soil contaminated with gasoline with the
application of sterile humic acid; (15) G + BS—the soil
contaminated with gasoline with the application of
Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas bacterial suspensions;
(16) G + MC—the soil contaminated with gasoline
and the application of the microbial complex of the
mucky–gley soil; (17) G + HA + BS—the soil contam
inated with gasoline and the application of the humic
acid preparation enriched with Rhodococcus and
Pseudomonas bacteria; and (18) G + HA + MC—the
soil contaminated with gasoline and the application of
humic acid preparation enriched with the complex of
microorganisms from the mucky–gley soil.
The influence of the bacterial–humus preparations
on the biological activity of the soils was assessed
according to the changes in the total bacterial number,
the respiration intensity of the soil microorganisms,
the nitrogen fixation, the denitrification and activity of
catalase, the dehydrogenase, the urease, and the phos
phatase. The structure of the saprotrophic bacterial
complex was also studied.
The total number of bacteria was determined by
luminescence microscopy using painting with acridine
orange [9]. The respiration intensity, the activity of
nitrogen fixation, and the denitrification by the soil
microorganisms were analyzed using the method of gas

chromatography [9]. The catalase activity was deter
mined by the Galstyan gasometric method [9]. For the
analysis of the dehydrogenase activity, 2,3,5triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride, which is reduced to a red com
pound, triphenylformazan, was applied. The amount of
the triphenylformazan formed was determined using a
colorimeter [9]. The urease activity was estimated using
the colorimetric measurement of the colored solution
that is formed as a result of the reaction with Nessler’s
reagent due to ammonia isolated upon the urea decom
position [9]. For the colorimetric analysis of the phos
phatase activity, the amount of phenolphthalein, which
is formed by the decomposition of phenolphthalein
phosphate, was determined [1].
For studying the effect of the bacterial–humus prep
arations on the structure of the bacterial community,
the method of plating on an agar glucose–peptone–
yeast medium was applied [8]. The plating was tradi
tionally performed from 1 : 100 and 1 : 10000 dilutions
(five replicates) after the preliminary treatment on a
UZDN1 ultrasound dispersant (22 kHz, 0.44 A,
2 min). In order to inhibit the development of fungi,
50 mg of nystatin was added for 0.5 L of the medium.
The effect of the preparations on plants was deter
mined according to the biomass of Lepidium sativum in
a pot experiment. Seeds of the salad (50 seeds) were
sown in vegetative pots with soddypodzolic soil (300 g).
The duration of the model experiment was 3 months.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The studies conducted showed that the pollution of
the soils with gasoline and Pb(CH3COO)2 significantly
affected all the indices of the soil biological activity
except for the respiration of the soil microorganisms.
Changes in the total number of bacteria. The 4% gas
oline pollution of the soil has led to a reduction in the
total bacterial number by 3 times (Fig. 1). The intro
duction of the bacterial–humus preparations to the
polluted soil promoted the increase in the number of
soil bacteria by 70%. A similar pattern was observed
upon the Pb(CH3COO)2 pollution of the soils.
Estimation of the soil enzyme activity. Enzymes of
oxidoreductases (catalase and dehydrogenase) and
hydrolases (urease and phosphatase) are considered in
this work.
The control soil was enriched with catalase to a
medium extent according to the Zvyagintsev scale [9]
(Fig. 2a). The gasoline pollution inhibited the catalase
activity to the greatest extent. In this case, compared to
the control, the catalase activity was 3 times lower. The
soil polluted with gasoline was referred to the soils poor
in catalase. The application of bacterial–humus prepa
rations increased the catalase activity by 60–80%. The
Pb(CH3COO)2 pollution decreased the catalase activity
to a lesser degree than in the case with the gasoline pol
lution.

By the dehydrogenase activity, the control soil was
referred to those with the medium content of this
enzyme (Fig. 2b). The introduction of the bacterial–
humus preparations increased the dehydrogenase
activity of the soil by 1.5–2.0 times. The soil with the
bacterial–humus preparations enriched with the
microorganisms from the mucky–gley soil was char
acterized as a rich one in terms of the dehydrogenase

activity. The gasoline pollution reduced the dehydro
genase activity by more than 3 times; according to the
content of this enzyme, this soil was referred to very
poor ones. The use of the bacterial–humus prepara
tions in the gasolinepolluted soil promoted the
increase in the dehydrogenase activity by 3–9 times;
the amount of this enzyme in the soil was medium.

to a greater extent than the catalase activity. As com
pared to the control soil, the dehydrogenase activity
decreased almost by 2 times; it was poor in terms of the
enrichment with this enzyme. The application of the
bacterial–humus preparations in the Pb(CH3COO)2
polluted soil 5–6 times increased the dehydrogenase
activity. Thus, the dehydrogenase activity, compared
to that of catalase, is a more sensitive indicator of the
soil biological activity.
The control soil was medium in terms of the urease
content (Fig. 2c). The gasoline pollution decreased
the urease activity by 2.5 times. The application of the
bacterial–humus preparations increased the urease
activity by 2–3 times, while the introduction of simple
bacterial suspensions to the contaminated soil did not
positively affect them. The character of the influence
of Pb(CH3COO)2 on the urease activity was similar to
that of catalase. The enzyme activity was 10%
reduced. The application of bacterial suspensions, as
in the case with gasoline pollution, did not have any
significant influence.
In terms of the phosphatase content, the control
soil was rich (Fig. 2d). The gasoline pollution
decreased the phosphatase activity by 2 times up to the
medium enrichment of the soil with this enzyme. The
use of the bacterial–humus preparations increased the
phosphatase activity by 2.5–5.0 times. The applica
tion of the bacterial suspensions, as the use of urease,
did not have any effect. Pb(CH3COO)2 inhibited the
phosphatase activity by 2 times, as well as gasoline did.
However, in this case, both the bacterial–humus prep
arations and bacterial suspensions did not positively
affect the enzyme activity.
Thus, the dehydrogenase and phosphatase activi
ties turned out to be the most sensitive characteristics.
Gasoline most significantly inhibited the activity of all
the enzymes in the soils. Pb(CH3COO)2 little influ
enced the catalase and urease activities but noticeably
affected the dehydrogenase and phosphatase activi
ties. The application of the bacterial–humus prepara
tions exerted the most positive influence on the
enzyme activity. The use only of bacterial cultures did
not positively affect the urease and phosphatase activ
ities in the gasolinecontaminated soils and the urease
activity in the Pb(CH3COO)2 polluted soil.
Changes in nitrogen fixation and denitrification. The
contamination of the soils decreased the activity of
nitrogenfixing microorganisms to a greater extent
(Fig. 3a). Upon Pb(CH3COO)2 pollution, the nitrogen
fixation was lowered by more than an order of magni
tude, while upon the gasoline pollution, by almost 2
orders. The application of the bacterial–humus prepa
rations in the gasolinepolluted soil intensified the
nitrogen fixation by 5 times. The positive effect of the
bacterial–humus preparations was 20% higher than
that in case of the application of the bacterial suspen
sions. With the use of these compounds in the
Pb(CH3COO)2 polluted soil, the nitrogen fixation
increased by 3–8 times. The positive effect of applying

the bacterial–humus preparations was twice higher
than that of the bacterial suspensions.
In the gasolinecontaminated soil, the denitrifi
cation became lower by 6 times (Fig. 3b); the use of
the bacterial–humus preparations increased it by 3–
6 times. The positive effect of the bacterial–humus
preparations exceeded that from the bacterial sus
pensions by 50–90%. A less inhibiting effect was
observed in the Pb(CH3COO)2 polluted soil. The
denitrification was 10% reduced. The use of the bac
terial–humus preparations intensified the denitrifi
cation by 1.5 times.
Changes in the respiration intensity of the soil
microorganisms. The respiration of the soil microor
ganisms changed to the least extent as compared to the
changes in the other indices of the soil biological activ
ity (Fig. 4). In the gasolinepolluted soils, the CO2
emission increased by 1.5 times due to the use of an
additional carbon source. The low difference in the
CO2 emissions between the test variants can be also
explained by the considerable contribution of fungi to
the soil respiration. Fungi are known to be more resis
tant to stress; therefore, gasoline little affected their
metabolic activity. This is also true for Pb(CH3COO)2.
Changes in the structure of the saprotrophic bacte
rial complex. The relative abundance of bacteria from

the genera studied was used for the characterization of
the saprotrophic bacterial complex structure accord
ing to the following gradations: dominants—more
than 30% of the total number of bacteria counted on
the applied medium; subdominants—20–30%; the
group of medium abundance—10–20%; and the
minor components—less than 10%.
The analysis of the structure of the saprotrophic
bacterial complex showed that, in most cases, the
application of the bacterial–humus preparations
promoted an increase in their diversity, which is esti
mated by the number of genera determined (Table 1).
The soil pollution caused an increase in the share of
Bacillus bacteria capable of enduring unfavorable
conditions by forming spores. As the bacterial–
humus preparations were applied, the share of Bacil
lus bacteria significantly decreased (Fig. 5a). Bacte
ria of the Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas genera that
often are present in the preparations used for the
remediation of oilpolluted soils are of a special
interest. The studies showed that Pb(CH3COO)2 in
the polluted soils inhibited the development of
Pseudomonas bacteria to a great extent (Fig. 5c).
During the experiment, it was not possible to isolate
representatives of this genus from the Pb(CH3COO)2
polluted soil without the application of any prepara
tions. The introduction of bacterial suspensions to
the soil increased the share of Pseudomonas bacteria
up to 0.9 and 2.0% in the pure Rhodococcus and
Pseudomonas cultures and in the soil microbial com
plex, respectively. In this case, Pseudomonas bacteria
are in the group of minor components. The applica
tion of the bacterial–humus preparations has caused
a significant increase (more than 10%) in the share of

representatives of this group. Thus, bacteria of this
group could be referred to the group of medium
abundance. The gasoline contamination exerted a
less adverse effect on the development of Pseudomo
nas bacteria as compared to the influence of
Pb(CH3COO)2, since gasoline components can be
used as a substrate. The use of the bacterial–humus
preparations also promoted the increase in the pro
portion of Pseudomonas bacteria.
The soil pollution less adversely affected the devel
opment of Rhodococcus bacteria than that of the
Pseudomonas representatives. However, in this case,
the positive influence of the bacterial–humus prepara
tions was also visible (Fig. 5c). The effect from using
the bacterial–humus preparations was 3–5 times
higher than the positive action from the application of
the bacterial suspensions.
Cresssalad biomass. The 4% gasoline contamina
tion of the soils reduced the biomass of the cresssalad
by an order of magnitude. The use of the bacterial–
humus preparations increased its biomass by 1.5–
2.0 times. Their effect was 10–20% higher than that of
the bacterial suspensions (Fig. 6). The Pb(CH3COO)2
pollution reduced the biomass by 25%. The applica
tion of the bacterial–humus preparations favored the
increase in the plant biomass by 40–50%; a faster tran
sition from the stage of vegetation to the flowering
stage was observed.
Statistical analysis of the results of the model exper
iment. The variance analysis of the results was per
formed to reveal what factors (type of pollution, appli
cation of humic acids, introduction and type of micro
bial complex) affect some characteristics of the soil

biological activity. For the classification of the test
variants, cluster analysis was used.
The variance analysis has revealed the following
(Table 2). The most sensitive characteristics of the soil
biological activity turned out to be the total number of
bacteria, the enzyme activity, and the denitrification.
All the factors considered affected these characteristics.
The nitrogen fixation was influenced by the soil
pollution (p = 0.00) and the humic acids applied (p =
0.0497). The introduction of any bacteria did not
affect the nitrogen fixation.
Only one factor, the soil pollution, influenced the
respiration activity of the microorganisms (p = 0.0002).
This fact agrees with the above described changes in the
CO2 emission.
Using the cluster analysis of the Word method, the
test variants were divided into several classes. This
analysis also enables one to divide the variants into
conventional groups (Fig. 7):
unpolluted soil (contains 3 objects: C, HA, HA +
BS);
restored soil (contains 10 objects: BS, MC, HA +
MC, Pb + HA, Pb + HA + BS, Pb + MC, Pb + HA +
MC, G + HA + BS, G + MC, G + HA + MC);
polluted soil (contains 5 objects: Pb, Pb + BS, G,
G + HA, G + BS).
Thus, the cluster analysis has confirmed the effi
ciency of using bacterial–humus preparations for the
restoration of the biological activity of contaminated
soils.

CONCLUSIONS
The soil pollution affected to different extents some
characteristics of the biological activity of the soddy
podzolic soil investigated. In the contaminated soils,
the nitrogen fixation and dehydrogenase and phos
phatase activities were mostly inhibited. The respira
tion intensity by the soil microorganisms turned out to
be the most resistant to soil pollution. The type of pol
lution also influenced the soil biological activity. Gas
oline inhibited all the characteristics of the biological

activity, except for the respiration; Pb(CH3COO)2
reduced the catalase and urease activities and denitri
fication to a lesser extent. The dehydrogenase and
phosphatase activities and nitrogen fixation were
strongly inhibited by Pb(CH3COO)2. In all the test
variants, the application of the bacterial–humus prep
arations had the highest positive effect on the biologi
cal activity. The introduction of bacterial suspensions
of pure cultures and the microbial complex without
humic acids to the polluted soil sometimes had no

effect. The biomass of the plants grown also depended
on the type of pollution and the method of soil reme
diation. The gasoline contamination ten times low
ered the plant biomass, while Pb(CH3COO)2 inhibited
the growth of plants to a lesser extent. The bacterial–
humus preparations stronger increased the plant bio
mass (by 10–20%) than the introduction only of the
bacterial suspensions. In addition, humic acids
enriched with the complex of microorganisms of the
mucky–gley soil accelerated the transition of plants
from the vegetation stage to the flowering stage.
One can conclude that the use of bacterial–humus
preparations is highly efficient for the remediation of
soils contaminated with heavy metals and oil products.

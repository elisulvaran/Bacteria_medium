ABSTRACT: The isolation, structure elucidation, and synthesis
of antalid (1), a novel secondary metabolite from Polyangium sp., is
described herein. The structure elucidation of 1 was performed
with the aid of mass spectrometry, high ﬁeld NMR experiments,
and crystal structure analysis. The absolute conﬁguration of antalid
was conﬁrmed through the Mosher ester method and ultimately by
total synthesis. In addition, the biosynthetic origin of this hybrid
PKS-NRPS natural product was unraveled by the in silico analysis
of its biosynthetic gene cluster.

M

yxobacteria are known to be a reliable source of novel
natural products with often unique structural features that
are rarely observed in other organisms.1,2 To date, more than 100
secondary metabolites with diﬀerent core structures and various
biological activities have been isolated from myxobacterial
sources.3 A majority of these metabolites derive from nonribosomal peptide synthetases, polyketide synthases, or are
hybrids thereof.4,5
Already in 2001 we isolated antalid from Polyangium sp., strain
Pl 4620, and determined its constitution.6 In the course of our
current HPLC−MS based screening project, the crude extract
from a liquid culture of the same Polyangium sp. was re-evaluated
and showed a secondary metabolite with m/z = 528.2518 for the
[M + H]+ ion. Subsequent dereplication based on retention time,
accurate mass, and isotope pattern using our in-house database
for myxobacterial compounds indicated that the respective peak
could be identical with antalid. Consequently, we set out to
isolate this secondary metabolite, antalid (1), by fermentation of
P. spec. Pl 4620 in 90 L of probion medium supplemented with
1% (v/v) XAD-16 adsorber resin. After several extraction steps
and puriﬁcation using RP-MPLC, a total of 30 mg of the pure
compound (1) was isolated (see Supporting Information, SI).
The accurate m/z value together with the observed isotope
pattern indicated a tentative molecular formula of C28H37N3O5S,
which would require 12 double bond equivalents. The exact twodimensional structure was elucidated using 1D- and 2D-NMR
spectroscopy (Figure 1a). Two methine protons in the range of
amino acid α-protons (19-H, m, 4.57 ppm, and 12-H, dd, 5.23

ppm, 3J = 9.2, 3.8 Hz) in combination with the corresponding
COSY and HMBC correlations indicated the presence of a Phe
and a Val residue. HMBC signals from 12-H, 13-H, 19-H, and
NHPhe, and a downﬁeld shifted proton (s, 8.34 ppm) to three
diﬀerent quaternary carbons suggested the presence of a
heteroaromatic ﬁve-membered ring, which was identiﬁed as a
thiazole in direct neighborhood to a carbonyl group. The PKSderived part of the molecule as inferred from COSY and HMBC
couplings is terminated by a triple substituted double bond (8-H,
dd, 6.60 ppm, 3J = 8.5, 1.3 Hz). Finally, HMBC correlations from
5-H/19-H to 20-C and 10 H/12-H to 11-C determined the cyclic
structure of antalid. Since we had been successful in predicting
the conﬁguration of polyketides based on analysis of keto

reductase and enoyl reductase domains in the past,7 we identiﬁed
and sequenced the biosynthetic gene cluster (Ant-m2-KR and
Ant-m3-KR). Examination of the conﬁguration at hydroxyl
branches (3-C, 5-C) was performed using our statistical
method10 since typical identiﬁers such as the LDD motif or the
indicative tryptophan that are required according to Caﬀrey8 and
McDaniel9 were missing (SI). Our statistical method calculated a
score diﬀerence value of 7.2 for the conﬁguration at 3-C, which is
too low in order to be reliable. The score diﬀerence value of 85.98
for the conﬁguration at 5-C, however, was of such a large absolute
value that the D-conﬁguration could be deduced with very high
conﬁdence. Based on the D-conﬁguration of the alcohol at 5-C
the statistical analysis of the conﬁguration of the methyl branch at
6-C gave a score diﬀerence value of −124.7, indicating an L-

conﬁguration with very high conﬁdence. This analysis was
conﬁrmed by a crystal structure analysis, which established the
relative conﬁguration of all ﬁve stereogenic centers unambiguously. In order to ﬁnalize the structure, the absolute
conﬁguration of 3-C was clariﬁed by preparing (S)- and (R)Mosher esters of the alcohol at the respective carbon, which
unambiguously revealed the 3D structure of antalid as shown in
Figure 1b.11 Detailed preparation protocols and all MS and NMR

product by special terminal C domains (CT).17 Bacterial C
domains of similar function have been reported for the
pipecolate-containing compounds FK520 and rapamycin.18 In
addition, a recently characterized new type of terminal C domain
can release linear carboxylic acids from the assembly line.19
Protein sequence alignment using the NaPDoS web tool resulted
in a clear grouping of the pipecolate-related CT domains in a
single clade, while the terminal antalid C domain is located
among the fungal CT (Figure 2C and SI).20 This ﬁnding is
supported by a more comprehensive alignment, which revealed
distinct groups for all three atypical C domains and even
indicated a subgrouping of the antalid domain slightly apart from
the fungal CT (SI).
Similar to the biosynthetic route, our initial strategy for the
synthesis of antalid (1) was to establish the macrocyclization of
seco acid 2 through an ester linkage as the pivotal step (Scheme
1). Despite extensive experimentation with various established
macrocyclization conditions (Yamaguchi,21 Shiina,22 KeckBoden,23,24 etc.) we were not able to obtain the desired
cyclization product. As an alternative, we envisioned to establish
the macrocycle through peptide bond formation of intermediate
3. In order to liberate the amino and acid functionalities we relied
on the alloc protecting group and an allyl ester, which could be
removed selectively under the same reaction conditions in a
single transformation.
Since 14 exhibits a typical motif that could in principal be
constructed via a vinylogous Mukaiyama aldol reaction, we
initially investigated this conversion. However, only decomposition or elimination products were observed under a variety of
conditions. In the forward direction the synthesis of the
polyketide fragment started with a Nagao aldol reaction using
reagent 7 and propanal.25,26 Subsequent conversion to the
Weinreb amide followed by TBS protection provided compound
8.27 Reduction to the corresponding aldehyde28 and Evans aldol
reaction established the remaining two chiral centers of the
polyketide segment. Transformation to aldehyde 11 was
achieved with the established sequence of Weinreb amide
formation, TES protection, and DiBAl-H reduction. Based on
our experience, saponiﬁcation of α-substituted unsaturated esters
is often problematic. Thus, we decided to introduce an allyl ester.
Therefore, we prepared Wittig reagent 12 from α-bromo
allylester 1329 and tri-n-butylphosphine, which reacted satisfyingly in the oleﬁnation reaction that led to the polyketide
fragment.
The allyl ester allowed mild deprotecting conditions and
established acid 6 in high yields through deprotection with
palladium and N-methylaniline (Scheme 2).
The synthesis of thiazole 5 started out from known ester
1530,31 and introduced an allyl moiety to selectively deprotect
both the acid and the amine under mild conditions at the end of
the synthesis. Next, acid 6 was brought to reaction with thiazole 5
employing EDC and HOBt, which removed the TES group
simultaneously. Compound 16 could therefore directly be used
in the condensation step with alloc-protected D-phenylalanine
(4).32,33 Now the stage was set for the removal of both protecting
groups (allyl ester and alloc) and subsequent macrocycle
formation. The removal of both protecting groups was a clean
transformation, and we therefore subjected the corresponding
amino acid directly to cyclization conditions utilizing HATU.
The desired product was obtained in 63% yield and was
transformed to antalid (1) by removing the remaining TBS
group with HF-pyridine in 90% (Scheme 3). All spectroscopic

Scheme 3. Fragment Coupling and Endgame in the Synthesis
of Antalid (1)

In the course of the project we used our myxobacterial crude
extract LC−MS database to identify several other P. spec., which
also produce antalid.12 Since we had achieved sequencing of the
genome of one of the alternative antalid producers, P. spumosum
MSr6761, we were able to search for the respective biosynthetic
gene cluster. In line with retrobiosynthetic considerations we
expected a PKS-NRPS hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster featuring
a characteristic heterocyclization domain to form the thiazole
moiety of antalid. 13 By using a known myxobacterial
heterocyclization domain as query sequence we identiﬁed a
modular PKS-NRPS cluster with the necessary modules
spanning 36,889 bp (Figure 2A).14 The cluster is organized in
two genes, antA and antB, with the PKS modules located on antA
and the NRPS modules on antB. Homologues of a serine
proteinase inhibitor upstream to antA and an active transporterrelated protein downstream to antB may be involved in resistance
and transport, respectively. With respect to the biosynthesis, only
three PKS modules would be necessary to form the PKS subunit
of antalid, whereas four modules are found on AntA (Figure 2B).
However, analyzing the ﬁrst ketosynthase (KS) reveals that the
active site cysteine is substituted by a serine. Such KS frequently
decarboxylate the extender unit without actually catalyzing the
condensation step (SI).15 Consequently, AntA-m1-KS most
likely acts by decarboxylating an initially loaded methylmalonate
to form the starter unit, an ACP-bound propionate. In line with
this the double-AT could be a remnant of a former biosynthetic
pathway version that had an elongating KS domain rather than a
decarboxylating one. Biosynthesis continues with two methylmalonyl-CoA extensions to form the PKS backbone of antalid.
The dehydratase (DH) of module 3 is inactive as inferred from
the structure of antalid (1). It should be noted though, that the
peptide sequence of AntA-m3-DH has no obvious deviation in
the typical motifs that would indicate an inactive domain.16 The
forthcoming NRPS modules incorporate valine, cysteine, and
phenylalanine with the cysteine of module 6 being cyclized and
oxidized to form a thiazole. An epimerase in module 7 is in
agreement with the (R)-Phe moiety found in antalid (1). The
intriguing aspect of antalid biosynthesis is, however, the lack of a
terminal thioesterase (TE) domain, which releases the product.
Instead, the cluster ends with a condensation (C) domain. In
particularly some fungal NRPS are known to release a cyclized

data of synthetic and authentic antalid were in good agreement
and thus conﬁrm the proposed structure.
In summary, we have isolated and characterized the novel
secondary metabolite antalid (1) from Polyangium spec. and P.
spumosum Pl 4620. Following retrobiosynthetic considerations
we identiﬁed the PKS-NPRS hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster by
mining the genome of the antalid (1) producer P. spumosum
MSr6761 for thiazole forming modules. Finally, we conﬁrmed
the assigned structure by total synthesis, which provides antalid
(1) in a longest linear sequence of 15 steps. Worth mentioning is
the fact that the macrocyclization could not be achieved by
joining both the polyketide and the peptidic portion but through
amide formation between both amino acids, which were liberated
through simultaneous allyl ester and alloc cleavage.

Haliangium ochraceum Fudou et al. 2002 is the type species of the genus Haliangium in the
myxococcal family ‘Haliangiaceae’. Members of the genus Haliangium are the first halophilic
myxobacterial taxa described. The cells of the species follow a multicellular lifestyle in highly
organized biofilms, called swarms, they decompose bacterial and yeast cells as most
myxobacteria do. The fruiting bodies contain particularly small coccoid myxospores. H.
ochraceum encodes the first actin homologue identified in a bacterial genome. Here we
describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence, and annotation. This is the first complete genome sequence of a member of the myxococcal
suborder Nannocystineae, and the 9,446,314 bp long single replicon genome with its 6,898
protein-coding and 53 RNA genes is part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and
Archaea project.

Introduction

Strain SMP-2T (DSM 14365 = CIP 107738 = JCM
11303) is the type strain of the species Haliangium ochraceum and was first described in 2002
by Fudou et al. [1]. In 1998 strain SMP-2T was described as swarming myxobacteria-like microorganism isolated from a dry seaweed sample (Laminariales)with optimum growth at NaCl concentrations of 2%. The attempt to isolate halophilic
myxobacteria was initiated by the detection of
myxobacterial phylotypes in marine sediments
[2]. A second species of the genus Haliangium, H.

tepidum, was described along with H. ochraceum
[1].
Only two other genera of marine myxobacteria,
each comprising one species, have been described
to date: Plesiocystis pacifica and Enhygromyxa salina [3,4]. All marine myxobacteria are phylogenetically grouped within one of the three suborders within the order Myxococcales, the Nannocystineae. INSDC databases indicate (as of December
2009) that members of Haliangium are very rare
in the environment, with the most closely related

16S rRNA gene sequences from uncultured bacteria being less than 94% similar to H. ochraceum SMP-2T.

Classification and features

At the time of species description of the two Haliangium species, the most similar 16S rRNA gene
sequence from cultivated strains originated from
strain Pl vt1T. This strain was published with the
name Polyangium vitellinum [5], hence the accession entry of its sequence (AJ233944) was also
registered with this species name up to November
2009. However, Reichenbach perceived that these
organisms meet perfectly Kofler’s description of
“Polyangium flavum”, but do not conform to the
description of the genus Polyangium. Thus Reichenbach revived Kofler’s “Polyangium flavum” in
a new genus, Kofleria, and designated strain Pl
vt1T the type strain of the species Kofleria flava
[6]. Subsequently, the species name was changed
in the Genbank entry for AJ233944. The 16S rRNA
gene sequences of the two Haliangium species
were less than 94% similar to this nearest neighbor [1], and thus far no sequences of cultivated or
uncultivated bacteria with higher similarities to
SMP-2T were deposited in GenBank.
In 2005, the family Kofleriaceae was created by
Reichenbach, containing the single species K. flava
[6], and the author mentioned in a note added
during the edition of Bergey’s Manual that he regarded the two Haliangium species as members of
the family Kofleriaceae. This family name has
standing in nomenclature [7]. Albeit, Haliangium
ochraceum is listed in the Taxonomic Outline of
the Prokaryotes [8] as member of the family “Haliangiaceae”, that has no standing in nomenclature. From a phylogenetic point of view, the genera Kofleria (terrestrial) and Haliangium (marine)
should be members of a single family.
Myxobacteria are distinct because of two exceptional features. The first is their high potential to
produce secondary metabolites, most of them affecting prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells and hence
awaiting exploitation for pharmaceutical applications or in plant protection. They encode genes for
key enzymes in the biosynthesis of polyketide and
peptide metabolites, polyketide synthases and
nonribosomal peptide synthetases, respectively
[9]. Their second distinctive characteristic is their
morphogenesis, i.e. the formation of fruiting bodies and development of myxospores, that is
based on cell-to-cell signaling among the single
cells of the population in a swarm. The genetic
background of the so called ‘social motility’ and
97

morphogenesis is understood best for Myxococcus
xanthus [10]. It is no surprise that these phenomena are regulated by sophisticated networks
including two-component regulatory systems
[11].
Figure 1 shows the phylogenetic neighborhood of
H. ochraceum SMP-2T in a 16S rRNA based tree.
The sequences of the two 16S rRNA gene copies in
the genome of do not differ from each other, and
do not differ from the previously published 16S
rRNA sequence of DSM 14365 (AB016470).
Vegetative cells of H. ochraceum stain Gramnegative and form cylindrical rods with blunt ends
(Table 1). They are embedded in an extracellular
matrix and measure 0.5-0.6 by 3-8 µm (Figure 2).
This cell form is characteristic for members of the
suborder Nannocystineae [6]. The colonies exhibit
spreading on solid surfaces such as agar as filmlike layers and thus are called ‘swarms’. The extending motion is propelled by gliding. On aging
culture plates, the cells do no more spread to explore new substrates (so called adventurous or A
motility) but also gather on specific points of the
swarms to form fruiting bodies (social or S motility) [10]. The fruiting bodies of strain SMP-2T are
light yellow to yellowish-brown, irregular, sessile
knobs with a diameter of 50-200 µm and contain
one or more oval-shaped sporangioles, each 20-60
µm in size [1,2]. The spherical to ovoid myxospores within the sporangioles measure 0.5-0.7 µm.
Thus they resemble the myxospores of Nannocystis species in being very tiny [1]. The myxospores
tolerate heat treatment at 55-60°C for 5 minutes
and storage in a desiccated stage for at least 3
months [23].
The strain requires NaCl for growth with an optimum concentration of 2% and good growth in the
range of 0.5-4% NaCl in agar or in liquid medium
[1,2,23]. Fruiting body formation was observed at
salt concentrations corresponding to 40-100% sea
water concentration but not at lower salt concentrations [23]. Media supporting growth are CY
medium, diluted 1:5, (DSMZ medium 67) or VY/2
medium (DSMZ medium 9) [26], each supplemented with seawater salts. No growth was obtained in tryptic soy broth with seawater salts [1].
Corresponding to the multicellular lifestyle, new
agar or liquid cultures of strain SMP-2T can only
be successfully started with very high inoccula.
The minimum cell load on a plate in order to induce a swarm is 105 [23]. The temperature range
for growth is 20-40°C with an optimum at 30-34°C [1].

Figure 1. Phylogenetic tree highlighting the position of H. ochraceum SMP-2T relative to the other type strains within the genus and the type strains of the other genera within the order Myxococcales. The tree was inferred from
1,463 aligned characters [12,13] of the 16S rRNA gene sequence under the maximum likelihood criterion [14] and
rooted in accordance with the current taxonomy. The branches are scaled in terms of the expected number of
substitutions per site. Numbers above branches are support values from 1,000 bootstrap replicates if larger than
60%. Lineages with type strain genome sequencing projects registered in GOLD [15] are shown in blue, published
genomes in bold.

Cells of strain SMP-2T are strictly aerobic with
weak oxidase and catalase reactions. They do not
grow in mineral media with carbohydrates or organic acids but are specialized decomposers of
macromolecules such as starch, DNA, casein, chitin
or gelatin. Cellulose, however is not cleaved. The
cells are equipped to decompose cells of other
bacteria or yeasts [1]. Correspondingly, enzymes
such as lipase (C14), trypsin, chymotrypsin, valine
or leucine arylamidases are active [1]. Whether or
not H. ochraceum actively hunt for prey bacteria
as shown for M. xanthus [27] has not been studied
yet.

Chemotaxonomy

The fatty acid profile of strain SMP-2T reveals saturated straight chain C16:0 (38.3%) and branched
chain iso-C16:0 (15.3%) acids as the major fatty acids. No hydroxylated fatty acids were detected, a
feature shared with members of the genera Nannocystis, Sorangium [1], Plesiocystis [4] and Enhygromyxa [3]. While the two Haliangium species
http://standardsingenomics.org

also contain anteiso-branched fatty acids as distinctive compounds [1], the specific feature of the
two other marine genera Plesiocystis and Enhygromyxa is the presence of polyunsaturated C20:4
acids [3,4]. A novel pathway for the biosynthesis
of iso-even fatty acids (by α-oxidation of iso-odd
fatty acids) was detected for the myxobacterium
Stigmatella aurantiaca [28]. In members of the
genus Nannocystis and Polyangium, true steroids
were detected, a very unusual trait among prokaryotes [6,29]. It would be interesting to study
whether these pathways are also found in H. ochraceum.
MK-8 is the predominant menaquinone in SMP-2T
as it is in all terrestrial myxobacterial taxa studied
[1,29]. It is noteworthy that the members of the
other marine genera Plesiocystis and Enhygromyxa
contain MK-8(H2) and MK-7, respectively [3,4].
The compositions of polyamines and the polar lipids of Haliangium strains have not been
analyzed.

H. ochraceum SMP-2T, DSM 14365, was grown in
CY medium with seawater salts (in grams per liter: casitone 3.0, yeast extract 1.0, NaCl 21.1, KCl

0.6, CaCl2 × 2 H2O 1.2, MgCl2 × 6 H2O 3.6, NaHCO3

DNA was isolated from 0.5-1 g of cell paste using
Qiagen Genomic 500 DNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany), with a modified protocol for cell lysis
(st/LALMP), as described in Wu et al. [30].

Genome sequencing and assembly

The genome was sequenced using a combination
of Sanger and 454 sequencing platforms. All general aspects of library construction and sequencing performed at the JGI can be found at the JGI
website (http://www.jgi.doe.gov/). 454 Pyrosequencing reads were assembled using the Newbler assembler version 1.1.02.15 (Roche). Large
Newbler contigs were broken into 10,273 overlapping fragments of 1,000 bp and entered into
the final assembly as pseudo-reads. The sequences
were assigned quality scores based on Newbler
consensus q-scores with modifications to account
for overlap redundancy and to adjust inflated qscores. A hybrid 454/Sanger assembly was made
using the parallel phrap assembler (High Performance Software, LLC). Possible mis-assemblies
were corrected with Dupfinisher or transposon
bombing of bridging clones [31]. Gaps between
contigs were closed by editing in Consed, custom
primer walk or PCR amplification. A total of 2,013
Sanger finishing reads were produced to close
gaps, to resolve repetitive regions, and to raise the
quality of the finished sequence. The error rate of
the completed genome sequence is less than 1 in
100,000. Together all sequence types provided
http://standardsingenomics.org

24.3× coverage of the genome. The final assembly
contains 90,757 Sanger and 689,516 pyrosequencing reads.

Genome annotation

Genes were identified using Prodigal [32] as part
of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory genome annotation pipeline, followed by a round of manual
curation using the JGI GenePRIMP pipeline
(http://geneprimp.jgi-psf.org/) [33]. The predicted CDSs were translated and used to search
the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) nonredundant database, UniProt, TIGRFam, Pfam, PRIAM, KEGG, COG, and InterPro databases. Additional gene prediction analysis and
functional annotation was performed within the
Integrated Microbial Genomes - Expert Review
(http://img.jgi.doe.gov/er) platform [34].

Genome properties

The genome is 9,446,314 bp long and comprises
one main circular chromosome with a 69.5% GC
content (Table 3 and Figure 3). Of the 6,951 genes
predicted, 6,898 were protein coding genes, and
53 RNAs. Fifty-three pseudogenes were also identified. The majority of the protein-coding genes

Starting from one of the conspicuous features of
the myxobacteria, the diversity of secondary metabolism, the number of known genes putatively
assigned to the COG category “Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism” is not
exceptionally high: 174 genes in comparison to,
for example, 136 genes in Pseudomonas putida F1.
The number of COG genes involved in “Replication, recombination and repair”, however, are remarkably increased: in H. ochraceum: 439 genes
were assigned to this category, in S. cellulosum
there are 541, whereas P. putida only contains 157
genes assigned to this category.

Insights from genome sequence

The genomes of two other myxobacteria, M. xanthus DK1622 and S. cellulosum strain So ce56,
were analyzed in depth [11,35-37] and may serve
as a roadmap to explore the genome of strain
SMP-2T.
Sixteen genes of strain SMP-2T were putatively
assigned to the COG category ‘Cytoskeleton’. Recognizing that almost all other bacteria do not

fact suggests that the genome harbors many yet
unknown genes. The distribution of genes into
COGs functional categories is presented in Table 4.

harbor any genes assigned to this category it is
worth mentioning that all myxobacterial genomes
studied so far include several copies in this category. Fifteen of the cytoskeleton genes of SMP-2T
belong to COG 5184 ’Alpha-tubulin suppressor
and related RCC1 domain-containing proteins‘.
Strain SMP-2T and P. pacifica, another rare marine
myxobacterium, together with Salinispora arenicola are the prokaryotes with the highest degree of
similarity of these genes, 15, 12, 14 and 15, respectively. Whereas RCC1 was known as a eukaryotic cell cycle regulator, RCC1-like repeats were
recently also detected in several prokaryotic genomes [38]. Future studies will have to elucidate
whether the SMP-2T sequences, automatically assigned to a RCC1 domain, are related to these repeats in particular. As the genes most similar to
the H. ochraceum RCC1-like proteins, as determined by protein BLAST with the NCBI database,
derive exclusively from other myxobacteria such
as P. pacifica or Stigmatella aurantiaca, it seems
plausible that they build a myxobacterial branch
within the RCC1 superfamily.

Description

General function prediction only
Function unknown
Not in COGs

The most striking finding in the H. ochraceum genome was a sequence coding for a protein of the
actin family (COG 5277) within the Cytoskeleton
category [30]. Only eight years ago, it became obvious that bacterial cells contain a cytoskeleton at
least as active as in eukaryotic cells. The bacterial
functional and structural homologues to the eukaryotic actin compound are the proteins MreB and
ParM [39]. However, the prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes coding for these proteins, or their amino
acid sequences, are not related on the sequence
level. In contrast, the sequence detected in H. ochraceum shows a striking sequence similarity to
actin and is the very first report of an actin homolog in a bacterial genome. The protein was called
BARP, bacterial actin-related protein. The genomic
103

context of barP, its sequence, the putative structure of the protein and evidence that the gene is
expressed were recently described by Wu et al.
[30]. Interestingly, several hits for proteins of the
actin family are given for Archaea by IMG.
Myxobacteria became known for their potential to
synthesize a vast array of secondary metabolites.
Polyketide synthases (PKS) and nonribosomal
peptide synthetases play the key role in the building pathways [37]. PKS multidomain complexes
are listed in COG 3221 in the category ‘Secondary
metabolites’. The sum of automatic assignments to
this category is not extraordinarily increased for
H. ochraceum in comparison to other bacteria
(174 hits as compared to, e.g., 136 in P. putida
strain F1), and the search for the gene product
Standards in Genomic Sciences

‘polyketide synthase’ does not find any gene for H.
ochraceum. However, the genome of H. ochraceum,
like the other myxobacteria studied, contains a
high number of stretches assigned to COG 3321.
The number of hits in COG is less than 10 in bacteria except for the myxobacteria, Burkholderia mallei, B. pseudomallei, Mycobacterium spp. and members of the Streptomyces. The annotations in COG
3321 for H. ochraceum identify the homologues as
known domains of PKS (for example acyltransferases or ketoreductases) or of a distinct PKS synthesizing the aglycone precursor of erythromycin
B. A search for PKS in different myxobacteria using PCR unfortunately did not include H. ochraceum but it included a strain representing the
second species in the genus, H. tepidum [40]. The
authors found the highest percentage of yet unde-

scribed PKS sequences (50% of all newly detected
PKS sequences) in the marine myxobacteria (as
compared to terrestrial myxobacteria). In H. tepidum, all 10 PKS sequences represented novel PKS
genes (threshold 70% identity to known sequences). These findings suggest that an in-depth
search for novel genes coding for isoprenoid metabolites in H. ochraceum has a very good prospect
of success.
Other promising fields of gene mining in H. ochraceum, as a representative of the marine myxobacteria, most likely are the genes of energy metabolism and the genes coding for the coordinated
movement of cells during fruiting body and myxospore formation. This morphogenesis is conducted by cell-to-cell cross-talk, signal transduction and induction of ‘social motility’ [10,41].

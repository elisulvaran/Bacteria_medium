Abstract Bacterial communities inhabiting coastal sediments are subjected to oil spills. In order to examine the
early structural response of a complex bacterial community
to oil pollution, a kinetic study of the crude oil impact on
bacterial communities inhabiting sediments from the contaminated Etang-de-Berre lagoon was performed. The
sediments were maintained in slurries in presence or
absence of crude oil and the kinetic study was carried out
14 days. During this period, 54% of crude oil was
biodegraded showing the importance of the early degradation step. The metabolically active community (16S rRNA
transcript analysis) was immediately impacted by the oil
input, observed as an apparent decrease of species richness
in the first hour of incubation. Nevertheless, this shift was
quickly reversed, highlighting a fast, adaptative and
efficient response of the metabolically active bacterial
population. The high proportion of sequences related to
hydrocarbonoclastic strains or petroleum-associated clones
in active oiled community was consistent with significant
increasing numbers of cultivable hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria at the end of the experiment. We concluded that

“Etang-de-Berre” bacterial communities inhabiting oiled
sediments for decades adopted a specific structure depending on oil presence and were able to face hydrocarbon
contamination quickly and efficiently.

Introduction
Oil pollutes by entering ecosystems naturally by seepage
from reservoirs and through anthropogenic activities including the extraction of oil from reservoirs, transportation,
processing in refineries and handling and disposal by end
users. Oil pollution of the sea and coastlines is difficult to
contain and causes significant ecological perturbations
leading to negative impacts on local fishing, aquaculture,
and tourist industries [10]. Some oil components accumulate and biomagnify through the food chain, and those that
are mutagenic or carcinogenic are prejudicial to the long
term health of marine organisms and their predators,
including humans [15]. Fortunately, a substantial proportion
of the oil entering marine habitats is degraded by
indigenous microorganisms and their use in bioremediation
processes has proven to be an effective method for cleaning
up residual oil in a variety of coastal environments [5, 13,
27].
A great deal of research on the diversity and the
metabolic activities of complex microbial communities
able to cope with oil compounds in environment has
been carried out, but many unknowns persist and more
work is needed to elucidate and understand their
complexity. The impact of oil on complex bacterial
community structures and the bacterial capacity to
degrade hydrocarbons has been mainly examined under
mineral nutrient and/or bioremediation agent treatments.
Although some studies showed that these treatments

Coastal bacterial Community Dynamic to Oil Response

improved significantly the oil biodegradation [7, 27],
other studies demonstrated either no effect of nutrient
addition [20] or that the nutrients have a greater impact on
the bacterial community than the oil alone [8]. Moreover,
the bioremediation agents produce residues that showed a
relatively high toxicity [7]. In addition, oil impact on the
bacterial community depends on the history of the site
pollution. Most of the pristine communities exposed to
petroleum contamination presented a decrease in diversity
associated with the selection of tolerant populations and
then a resilience phenomenon [2, 8, 27]. In contrast, the
response of indigenous communities previously exposed
to petroleum compounds, dominated by organisms able to
utilise and/or survive to toxic hydrocarbons, is expected to
occur faster and more specifically [4, 14]. The bacterial
community diversity may also be influenced by the
complexity of chemical mixtures present and the length
of the exposure time. Recent works showed that the study
of the metabolically active populations provides new
insights for the characterization of the bacterial community response to oil contamination [2, 21]. However,
information on the early response (within the first hours
and days) of a complex bacterial community to oil
exposure is still scarce. Gaining insights into the bacterial
abundance, phylogenetic structure changes and degradation activity occurring in the first stage of oil contamination would be of great interest since it is hypothesised that
the hydrocarbonoclastic populations are established within
2 weeks in the community related to fast biodegradation
events [14].
The aim of the present study was to determine the
short- and mid-term modifications occurring on the preestablished bacterial communities from coastal sediment
in response to a simulated oil spill. The Etang-de-Berre,
a brackish lagoon bordering the Mediterranean Sea in
the South of France, is characterised by important
industrial activities and receives important amounts of
hydrocarbons from refineries, petrochemical plants and
transportation systems in addition to biogenic inputs
[16]. The bacterial communities inhabiting these sediments being well-adapted to the oil presence seemed to
carry all the metabolic machinery for coping with
hydrocarbon exposure. Thus these bacterial communities
constitute an interesting environmental model to gain a
better understanding of the effectiveness of biodegradation in contaminated coastal environments. Thus, combining gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
analysis, culture-dependant and molecular approaches
(terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP), 16S rRNA gene and transcript libraries), the
response of whole microbial community and its active
members was screened throughout a slurry experiment
during the first hours and days after crude oil input.

Materials and Methods
Sediment Sampling
The subsurface sediments (0–2 cm) were collected from the
station EDB1 (43°29′05″N; 5°11′17″E) of the Berre
brackish lagoon bordering the Mediterranean Sea on
October 2005 [24]. These shallow sediments (water column
height around 30 cm) have been chronically subjected to
hydrocarbon contamination for several decades, leading to
hydrocarbon concentration of around 100 μg/g dry sediment. In order to assess the impact of the experimental
design on the original bacterial community structure, a subsample (0.5 g) of homogenised sediments was immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until the
analysis of in situ DNA bacterial community structure (IS).
The remaining sediments were maintained at room temperature during the transport and the slurry experiment.
Slurry Set-up
The sediment samples were homogenised through a 3 mm
sieve and maintained for 4 weeks under daylight condition
and at room temperature in order to remove low-molecular
weight hydrocarbons (boiling point c.a. 50 and <200°C). A
sediment slurry was then prepared with 40% of wet
sediment and 60% of sterile synthetic water (SSW) at a
salinity of 20 PSU (KCl 0.428 g/l; CaCl2.2H2O 0.84 g/l;
NH4Cl 1.514 mg/l; MgSO4.7H2O 3.794 g/l; MgCl2.6H2O
3.017 g/l; NaCl 15.14 g/l; Na2CO3 0.15 g/l; trace element
solution SL12 [23] without EDTA; potassium phosphate
buffer 10−5 M at pH 7), and stabilised at 150 rpm agitation
for 1 week. Triplicate microcosms were then set up in
100 ml sterile vial bottles containing 16 ml of the stabilised
slurry and incubated for 2 days at room temperature in
daylight prior oil addition. Half of the slurry bottles were
amended with 274±28 mg Vic Bilh oil (Vic Bilh field in
South East of France) and which represented the bioticspilled oil condition (B+OIL). This level of contamination
was chosen to simulate an oil spill that is likely to induce a
perturbation in the bacterial communities. The main
characteristics of Vic Bihl oil are as follows: density
926.71 kg/l at 15°C, viscosity 30 Cst at 50°C, API: 21.
The remaining slurries were defined as the bioticunamended condition (B − OIL). Abiotic spilled oil
condition (AB+OIL) were set up using SSW, sterile
Fontainebleau sand and Vic Bilh oil (Fig. 1). Before
autoclaving, ultrasonic treatment in dichloromethane
(DCM) (3×15′) was applied to the Fontainebleau sand
and the DCM was evaporated during 24 h under airflow.
Slurry microcosms were incubated under aerobic conditions
at room temperature in daylight and with continuous
agitation on an orbital shaker (150 rpm). Triplicate micro-

cosms were then used for analysis after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 h
and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12 and 14 days of incubation. For
chemical analysis, microcosms were immediately frozen
and stored at −80°C. For molecular analysis, the slurry
samples were centrifuged at 8,000×g for 5 min at 4°C. The
pellets were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and
conserved at −80°C until DNA and RNA extraction. Only
RNase-free certified plastic wares were used. All molecular
analyses except libraries were carried out in triplicates.
Chemical Analysis
Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) extraction from chemically dried sediment samples (5±0.05 g) was performed using
a sequential ultrasonic solvent extraction as described by
Risdon et al. [26]. Deuterated alkanes and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) including dodecane-d22,
nonadecane-d 4 0 , triacontane-d 6 2 , naphthalene d 8 ,
phenanthracene-d10, chrysene-d12 and perylene-d12 (purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Dorset, UK) were added to
the extracts at 0.5 and 0.4 gml−1. TPH, aliphatic and

aromatic fractions were identified and quantified by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry using a Perkin Elmer
AutoSystem XL gas chromatograph coupled to a Turbomass
Gold mass spectrometer operated at 70 eV in positive ion
mode. The column used was a Restek fused silica capillary
column (30×0.25 mm internal diameter) coated with RTX®5MS (0.25 μm film thickness). Splitless injection with a
sample volume of 1 μl was applied. The oven temperature
was increased from 60°C to 220°C at 20°C/min−1 then to
310°C at 6°C/min and held at this temperature for 15 min.
The mass spectrometer was operated using the full scan
mode (range m/z 50–500) for quantitative analysis of target
alkanes and PAHs. For each compound, quantification was
performed by integrating the peak at specific m/z. External
multilevel calibrations were carried out for both aliphatic and
aromatic fractions, ranging from 0.5 to 2500 μgml−1 and
from 1 to 5 μgml−1, respectively. For quality control, a
500 μgml−1 diesel standard and mineral oil were checked
every ten samples. The percent depletion of all hydrocarbons
were normalised to chrysene that is considered as one of the
more persistent PAHs and calculated using the equation:

Coastal bacterial Community Dynamic to Oil Response

%loss ¼ ½ððA0 =H0 Þ  ðAs =Hs ÞÞ=ðA0 =H0 Þ  100 as previously described by Prince et al. [25]. As and Hs are the
concentrations of the target compound and chrysene in the
oil sample, respectively, and A0 and H0 are the initial
concentrations in the crude oil.
The significance of hydrocarbon degradation relative to
controls was determined by repeated measures of analysis
of variance followed by the post-hoc Tukey's multiple
comparison test when P<0.05. All tests were performed
using GraphPad InStat version 3.0a (GraphPadSoftware,
San Diego California USA, www.graphpad.com).
Hydrocarbon-growing Bacteria Enumeration
Hydrocarbon-growing bacteria enumeration of the B−OIL
and B+OIL microcosms was performed by the plate-count
method in triplicates after 0, 7 and 14 days. Plates were
prepared with washed agar (20%) and sterile synthetic
seawater, supplemented or not with hexadecane or naphthalene as sole carbon source. Hexadecane (750 μl) was
distributed on a sterilised filter paper placed in the Petri
dish lid and in contact with agar surface to allow agar
covering by capillarity. One hundred microlitres of a
solution of naphthalene (31.25 mg/ml) was directly spread
on agar plates. Naphthalene was dissolved in diethyl ether
for easy distribution of the substrate and quick evaporation
of the solvent. One hundred microlitres of appropriate
dilutions of slurry in sterile synthetic seawater were surface
spread onto plates. Plates were incubated for 47 days at
room temperature. The non-parametric U test of Mann and
Whitney was applied to CFU counts in order to determine
whether the differences between the different incubation
time and slurry conditions were significant.
Thirty colonies from 0, 7 and 14 days enumeration plates
were selected for their different morphology and isolated.
Their capacity to grow on hexadecane or naphthalene was
checked by successive subcultures in liquid or solid
medium containing hexadecane or naphthalene as sole
carbon source. Identification of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria was carried out by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as
described below.
Molecular Analysis
DNA and RNA Extraction
Total genomic DNA extractions from the IS and the slurry
microcosms were performed in triplicates at day 0, 7 and 14
using the alternative lysis method of the UltraClean™ Soil
DNA isolation kit (MOBIO Laboratories Inc., USA). The
manufacturer instructions were followed except for the
initial step of lysis in which each sediment sample were
vortexed horizontally during 20 min. Purified DNA was

397

suspended in 50 μl of sterile water and examined by
agarose gel electrophoresis. All extracted genomic DNA
samples were stored at −20°C until further processing.
Total RNA extraction of the slurry microcosms were
performed in triplicates using the FastRNA Pro Soil-Direct
kit (Q-Biogen) following manufacturer’s instructions after a
first step of lysis (three times for 1 min at 30 Hz) in a bead
beater (TissueLyser, Qiagen) and without a matrix purification step. RNA pellets were suspended in 100 μl sterile
water and controlled on 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel. To
remove any genomic DNA contamination, the samples
were treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion). The quality of
RNA extract was checked using a RNA 6000 Nano Chip
kit and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser. All RNA extracts were
stored at −80°C until further processing.
Reverse Transcription
DNase-treated RNA were reverse transcribed with Moloney
murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (M-MLV RT,
USB Corporation) as follows: the random hexamers (5 μl at
0.1 U A260, Roche), the RNase OUT (40 U) and the RNA
extract (2 μl) were denatured 5 min at 65°C and chilled
5 min at 4°C. The 5× reaction buffer, dNTP mix (0.5 μmol)
and M-MLV RT (240 U) were then added to a final volume
of 50 μl. The reaction was incubated 2 h at 42°C. RT
products were used immediately for polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) amplification and the remaining products
were stored at −20°C. Possible DNA contamination of
RNA templates was checked by PCR amplification of
aliquots of RNA without reverse transcription step. No
DNA was detected in these reactions.
PCR Amplification and T-RFLP Analysis
The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using the
primers (Escherichia coli numbering) 8F-TET (5′-tetrachlorofluorescein phosphoramidite-5′ AGAGTTTGATCCTGG
CTCAG-3′; [19]) and unlabelled 1489R (5′-TACCTTGTTACGACTTCA-3′; [30]), giving a product of approximately
1,480 bp. The PCR and T-RFLP analysis were carried out as
described by Bordenave et al. [2] using Eurobio Taq
polymerase. The fluorescent PCR products were cleaned
with GFX DNA and Gel Band Purification kit (GE Healthcare) and 100 ng of purified product digested separately with
3 U of enzyme HaeIII and HinfI in a final volume of 10 μl
for 3 h at 37°C (New England Biolabs). A 1 μl of restriction
digests were then mixed with 20 μl of deionized formamide
and 0.5 μl of a TAMRA labelled Genescan 500 bp internal
size standard (Applied Biosystems), denatured for 5 min at
95°C, and immediately transferred to ice. Samples were
loaded onto an ABI PRISM 310 automated genetic analyser
(Applied Biosystems). T-RFLP profiles were aligned by

398

identifying and grouping homologous fragments, and normalised by calculating relative abundances of each terminal
restriction fragments (T-RFs) using height fluorescence
intensity. Combined data from each restriction enzyme,
normalised T-RFLP profiles were compared. For statistical
analysis, the averages of the T-RFs heights detected in
triplicates with each endonuclease (HaeIII and HinfI) were
used. In order to identify the impact of oil on the bacterial
community structure at DNA and RNA levels, clustering
analysis coupled to two-dimensional non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (2D-nMDS) based on Bray Curtis
similarity taking into account the average of T-RF relative
abundances was carried out with Primer6 (Plymouth
Routines In Multivariate Ecological Research, version 6.1.6).

DNA and RNA Clone Library Analyses
One DNA (0h B-OIL DNA) and five cDNA libraries (0h
B−OIL cDNA, 9d B−OIL cDNA, 12d B−OIL cDNA, 9d
B+OIL cDNA, and 12d B+OIL cDNA) were constructed
and analysed. Purified PCR or RT-PCR products amplified
with the 8F and 1489R unlabelled primers were cloned into
E. coli TOP10F’ using the pCR2.1 Topo TA cloning kit
(Invitrogen, Inc). Clones were selected randomly. Inserts
were amplified using M13 primers (Eurogentec) surrounding the cloning site and analysed by RFLP (Restriction
Fragment Length Polymorphism) with the same endonucleases used for T-RFLP analysis using the same conditions. Identical clones on the basis of their RFLP profiles
were clustered and one representative clone of each cluster
was sequenced, except for 0h B−OIL DNA library where
singletons were not sequenced. Sequences were analysed as
previously described by Païssé et al. [24].
Selected inserts were sequenced using M13 primers
(Eurogentec) and the Big Dye® Terminator v3.1 cycle
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were first
analysed using the CHECK CHIMERA programme on the
RDP Database Project website (http://rdp8.cme.msu.edu/
html/) [6]. Then sequences were compared with the
GenBank nucleotide database library by BLAST on-line
searches [1]. Multiple sequence alignment of clones was
performed by using CLUSTALX v1.83 [29] and PROcessor of SEQuences v2.91 [9]. Phylogenies were constructed
with the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis v3.0
programme [18] using Kimura two parameters model and
Neighbour-joining algorithm. The significance of the
branching order was determined by bootstrap analysis with
1000 resampled data sets. Sequences with similarity over
97% were considered to represent one phylotype and were
grouped for statistical analysis. PAST (PAleontological
Statistics v1.60) software from http://folk.uio.no/ohammer/
past/ website was used to perform rarefaction analysis and
calculate diversity indices for each clone library [11]. In

The total hydrocarbon concentration of the sediment
slurries before Vic Bilh oil addition was 5 mg/kg of dried
weight sediment. The oil fingerprint analysis showed a
clear dominance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(97%) over aliphatic hydrocarbons (3%) (Table S1, supplementary data). Once Vic Bilh crude oil was added to the
slurries, as expected the oil fraction mass balance was
reverted to a dominance of aliphatic hydrocarbons (76%)
over aromatics (24%) (Fig.1). The most dominant hydrocarbon compounds were n-alkanes ranging from C10 to C20
constituting 90% of the aliphatics and the 2- and 3-ring
PAHs including naphthalene, dibenzothiophene, phenanthrene and their alkylated forms as well as fluorene and
fluoranthene (88 % of PAHs) for the aromatics.
Oil emulsification was observed in all biotic-oil
amended slurries (B+OIL) after 2 days of experiment,
suggesting biological degradation of crude oil [22]. GC-MS
analysis of the B + OIL slurries revealed significant
degradation of aliphatic (F=7.548, p<0.001) and aromatic
(F=57.488, p<0.001) hydrocarbons after 14 days (Fig. 1).
The total extractable hydrocarbons were reduced to 69%
and 46% of their initial amount after 7 and 14 days,
respectively. Tukey's multiple comparisons test showed that
biodegradation of the aliphatics was, however, not significant between 7 and 14 days (q=2.472, p>0.05). It further
showed that biodegradation of the aromatic hydrocarbons
was significant between T0 and 14 days (q=0.3683, p<
0.05). More than 60% of the most toxic PAH compounds,
including naphthalene, fluorene, fluoranthene and pyrene
were degraded in 14 days (Fig. 1).
Hydrocarbon-degrading Bacteria Count
Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the microcosms were
estimated to be 1.8×107 CFU.ml−1 prior to oil addition and
remained stable all through the experiment for the unoiled
slurries (p>0.05). For the oiled slurry, the same trend was

Coastal bacterial Community Dynamic to Oil Response

observed for the beginning of the experiment, but the
number of oil-degraders increased significantly (1×108 to
1.67×108 CFU/ml) after 14 days of incubation. At the end
of the experience, significant differences between the
cultivable bacteria of B+OIL (1×108 to 1.67×108 CFU/
ml) and B−OIL slurries (1×107 to 3.3×107 CFU/ml) were
observed (Mann–Whitney T=2.5, n1 =n2 =9, p<0.001)
(Fig. 2).
After successive cultures of the 30 strains isolated from
agar plate to liquid medium, two were able to grow quickly
on hexadecane as sole carbon source. Analysis of the 16 S
rRNA gene sequence (~1100 pb) of the two strains showed
99% identity with the 16S rRNA gene sequence of
Alcanivorax borkumensis SK2.

Similarity

The experiment set-up has been developed to explore the
response of the metabolically active bacterial populations
from homogenous and stable DNA community. Since
experimental settings could induce changes in the bacterial
community structure, the influence of sediment manipulation has been assessed by comparing the T-RFLP profiles
obtained from 16S rRNA gene analysis of the Etang-deBerre sediments (IS) and 0h B−OIL samples (Fig. 3). The
low similarity (37%) between these two community profiles
based on the relative abundance of terminal-restriction
fragments (T-RFs) confirmed the structure modifications
induced by the experimental procedures. However, the
difference observed in the bacterial community structure of
IS and 0h B−OIL samples was not the consequence of a
diversity decrease since the OTUs specific richness were
nearly identical (data not shown). Qualitative changes
(population shift) occurred in the disturbed and weathered
sediment. The similarities (Bray-Curtis index) between

Figure 3 Similarity analysis of the DNA bacterial community
structures based on T-RFLP of 16S rRNA gene from in situ (IS) and
slurry experimental samples. The UPGMA cluster analysis was
performed using square root transformation of T-RFLP data and the
Bray Curtis similarity index. Dashed line represents 67% of similarity
index. Microcosm triplicate averages were used for the cluster analysis

microcosm communities were higher than 67% which were
similar to those obtained between replicates (up to 70%).
Therefore, the DNA based analysis did not show clear
modifications in the total bacterial communities structure
related to the incubation conditions (B+OIL and B−OIL)
over the time (days 0, 7 and 14) (Fig. 3).
The changes in metabolically active bacterial community
structure in oil amended and unamended microcosms were
examined by T-RFLP analysis followed by cluster analyses and
a two-dimensional non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (Fig. 4). The similarity between microcosm triplicates
was always higher than 65% and reached up to 80%. A
temporal modification is observed in both microcosms that
were related to the well known bottle effect. Oil addition
induced an immediate shift (within 1 h) in the metabolically
active bacterial community structure (Fig. 4a). This difference
is characterised by an important decrease in the OTUs specific
richness (R) in the B+OIL slurry (8 and 12 T-RFs in B+OIL
slurry vs. 23 and 18 in B−OIL slurry with HaeIII and Hinf1
profiles, respectively) (Fig. 5). However, the metabolically
active community was restored 1 h later. Following this first
step of adaptation, the communities were stable during 3 days.
Two bacterial community structures showing differences
between the contaminated and uncontaminated slurries were
observed after 3 days of incubation (Fig. 4b). These structures
were maintained until the ninth day (clusters B and C). After
12 days of incubation the differences between the communities increased (clusters D and E) (Fig. 4b). Thus the T-RFLP
analysis showed five main clusters, the first cluster A

Figure 4 Changes in metabolically active bacterial community
structures based on T-RFLP analysis of 16S rRNA transcripts. The
2D-MDS plot analyses were performed using square-root transformation of T-RFLP data and the Bray Curtis similarity index. Circles and
squares represent average of microcosm triplicates (a MDS-plot
analysis of 0 h to 2 days samples; black lines, dashed bold line and
dashed thin line represent, respectively, similarity index 70, 65 and 59.
b MDS-plot analysis of 0 h to 14 days samples of oiled and unoiled
conditions. Five main clusters are mentioned (A, B, C, D and E)
representing the specific bacterial community structure patterns.
Dashed bold line and dashed thin line represent, respectively,
similarity index of 53 and 45 for the MDS-plot analysis)

including the communities from day 0 to 2 days, clusters B
and C corresponding to communities from 3 to 9 days, of
oiled and unoiled, respectively. The two last clusters included
the communities from day 12 to 14, cluster D was formed by
communities from oiled microcosms while the cluster E
contained the communities from unoiled microcosms.
Bacterial Community Composition and Dynamics
In order to further characterise the metabolically active
communities, 16S rRNA transcript libraries were constructed for a representative sample of each cluster

identified by T-RFLP. The analysis of the five libraries,
0h B−OIL (cluster A), 9d B+OIL (cluster B), 9d B−OIL
(cluster C), 12d B+OIL (cluster D) and 12d B−OIL (cluster
E), allowed the identification of the dominant metabolically
active populations associated to the presence of crude oil.
As expected, the Shannon diversity indices indicated a
higher diversity at DNA level than RNA (Table 1).
The RFLP analysis of the initial DNA community
library revealed that 84% of the clones analysed were
singletons. Sequences from patterns with more than one
clone were mainly related to Gamma- (49%) and Deltaproteobacteria (35%), followed by Diatom chloroplast
(11%), Alpha- (2%), Epsilonproteobacteria (2%) and Acidobacteria (2%) sequences. The Gammaproteobacteria
group was also dominant in all the RNA libraries
throughout the experiment. The comparison of the cDNA
clone libraries with the LIBSHUFF method revealed that
12d B−OIL and 12d B+OIL libraries were composed of
significantly different phylotypes (XY p value=0.004; YX
p value=0.021) while no difference could be observed
between the 9d B−OIL and 9d B+OIL cDNA clone
libraries (XY p value=0.034; YX p value=0.174), confirming the T-RFLP results (Fig. 5). Changes in the relative
abundance of the main groups composing the metabolically
active communities were observed. The Deltaproteobacteria
subclass maintained the same relative abundance from 0 h to
12 days in the B-OIL condition (around 20%) whilst its
abundance decreased until 11% and 14% at respectively 9
and 12 days of incubation in the B+OIL slurry (Table 2). In
contrast, the Gammaproteobacteria group reached 58% of
the active members of the oiled slurry at the end of the
experiment while its abundance decreased significantly in
the unoiled slurry (Table 3). The relative abundance of
Alphaproteobacteria sequence increased during the experiment period from 4% at 0 h to respectively 14% and to 23%
in oiled and unoiled conditions at 12 days (Table 2).
Around 50% of total sequences detected in the DNA
library (Tables 2 and 3) have highest Blastn hits with
sequences originated from hydrocarbon-degrading or
hydrocarbon-associated strains belonging to Gamma- and
Deltaproteobacteria. This important proportion of sequences related to highly specialised bacteria in the community
studied was also observed in the metabolically active
bacterial community. Indeed, the hydrocarbon-degrading
associated sequences in 0h B−OIL, 9d B−OIL, 12d B−OIL,
9d B+OIL and 12d B+OIL cDNA libraries represent
respectively 27%, 25%, 40%, 37% and 39% of total
sequences (Tables 2 and 3). The proportion of
hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria sequences was relatively
similar between the B − OIL and B + OIL conditions.
However Gammaproteobacteria sequences belonging to
Alcanivorax and Cycloclasticus genera or hydrocarbonassociated clones were dominant in the oiled slurries, while

Discussion
Heavily petroleum-contaminated sediment was chosen for
this study since the community inhabiting these sediments
is adapted to the presence of oil [24] and consequently its
bacterial community presents more potential abilities than
those from pristine environments to cope with oil hydrocarbons. These abilities include not only biodegradation
capacities [3], but also a higher resistance potential to the
toxic effect of the pollutant. In order to reduce the low
molecular-weight hydrocarbon content of sediment and to
adapt the bacterial communities to laboratory conditions,
the collected sediments were weathered. Thus, after this
treatment the observed bacterial community response
would be specifically linked with the crude oil addition.
The slurry setting also promotes aerobic metabolisms that
are well-known to be more efficient in hydrocarbon
biodegradation process, nevertheless because the oxygenation was exclusively performed by air diffusion we assume
that anoxic niches cannot be excluded. During the slurry
experiment, no significant change in the total bacterial
community structure was observed in response to oil input
despite the fact that an important part of the hydrocarbon
compounds was biodegraded in 7 days. Thus the short

Incubation time (day)

incubation period performed in this study allowed to
describe the fast response of the community present in the
slurry by analysing the active community (rRNA transcripts
analysis). Indeed, the metabolically active bacterial communities changed quickly and differentially depending on
the incubation conditions. For instance, the unoiled community was rapidly modified during the experiment
probably due to the depletion of hydrocarbon compounds,
mainly alkanes and low molecular weight PAHs, and the
ageing conditions of the microcosms whereas the B+OIL
community structure was maintained closer to the original
community due to the oil addition. Previous studies
performed at DNA level on pristine or low contaminated
communities indicated that after an important lag period [2,
12] oil contamination induced drastic changes in the
bacterial community structure associated with a decrease
of diversity [27, 31]. These modifications were either
attributed to a strong selection for petroleum-degrading
bacteria [13, 17, 31], or to toxic effect of oil on the growth
of certain microorganisms [12]. In our case (i.e. a bacterial
community inhabiting heavily contaminated sediments with
a long history of contamination), oil appeared necessary for
maintaining the metabolically active populations. Oil
addition induced a qualitative shift (specific richness
decrease) in the metabolically active community after 1 h.
Nevertheless, this shift was reversed after 1 h, highlighting
a fast, adaptative and efficient response of the metabolically
active bacterial population. Thus this study reinforces the
concept that important processes in response to oil
contamination occur within few hours following an oil

An 84% of singletons of the library have been not sequenced and not considered here. The percentage includes only the patterns with more than one clone

spill event. These processes lead to an efficient biodegradation which probably include many other biological
processes, such as remarkable bacterial resilience to toxicity
and physico-chemical modifications of the oil degrading
matrix.
The significant increase in numbers of hydrocarbondegrading bacteria, the high proportion of sequences affiliated
to hydrocarbon-degrading strains in the initial community and
the high abundance of highly specialised metabolically active
oil-degrading populations confirmed the adaptation of this
community to the oil presence. Although increases of the
proportion of hydrocarbon–degraders in response to hydro-

carbon contamination have been previously observed [4],
such a high proportion of hydrocarbon-degrading organisms
detected within sediment bacterial community have not
previously been described. The sediments of the retention
basin of the Berre lagoon represent an exceptional environment associated to crude oil pollution. Both oil amended and
unamended microcosms showed a high proportion of active
bacteria related to hydrocarbon degraders, as expected since
these specialised bacteria were found dominant in the
community present in the slurry. Nevertheless, it is important
to note that both communities are significantly different
since, the gammaproteobacteria responded faster to the

404

hydrocarbon input suggesting that they have probably an
important role in hydrocarbon depletion.
Interestingly, the relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria increased during the course of the experiment,
irrespective of the slurry condition. This finding is in
agreement with other studies that suggest that these
bacterial groups succeed to Gammaproteobacteria in the
process of bioremediation [2, 27]. This is further supported
by the higher relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria
observed in the unoiled slurry compared with the oiled
slurry, since the bioremediation process in the unoiled
slurry was ahead compared to the oiled slurry.
To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the
first study reporting the succession of metabolically active
bacterial populations occurring during the early stage of the
response to oil contamination. The T-RFLP fingerprints
revealed an important modification of the metabolically
active bacterial community structure within the first hours
following oil addition. This observation suggests that
essential mechanisms take place during the early period,
however further investigations are requested to understand
and characterise them. The bacterial communities from the
sediment of the Etang de Berre ecosystem exhibited several
properties that are suitable for studying the early response
at the functional level to fully understand the metabolic
strategy developed by the whole community to face crude
oil contamination.

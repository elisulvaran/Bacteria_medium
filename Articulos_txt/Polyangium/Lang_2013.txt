Ten species of the order Myxococcales with validly published names are devoid of living type
strains. Four species of the genus Chondromyces are represented by dead herbarium samples as
the type material. For a species of the genus Melittangium and two species of the genus
Polyangium, no physical type material was assigned at the time of validation of the names or later
on. In accordance with rule 18f of the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria the
following type strains are designated for these species: strain Cm a14T (5DSM 14605T5JCM
12615T) as the type strain of Chondromyces apiculatus, strain Cm c5T (5DSM 14714T5JCM
12616T) as the type strain of Chondromyces crocatus, strain Sy t2T (5DSM 14631T5JCM
12617T) as the type strain of Chondromyces lanuginosus, strain Cm p51T (5DSM 14607T5JCM
12618T) as the type strain of Chondromyces pediculatus, strain Me b8T (5DSM 14713T5JCM
12633T) as the type strain of Melittangium boletus, strain Pl s12T (5DSM 14670T5JCM 12637T)
as the type strain of Polyangium sorediatum and strain Pl sm5T (5DSM 14734T5JCM 12638T)
as the type strain of Polyangium spumosum. Furthermore, the type strains given for three species
of the genera Cystobacter and Polyangium had been kept at one university institute and have
been lost according to our investigations. In accordance with Rule 18c of the Bacteriological
Code, we propose the following neotype strains: strain Cb fe18 (5DSM 14716 5JCM 12624) as
the neotype strain of Cystobacter ferrugineus, strain Cb m2 (5DSM 147515JCM 12627) as the
neotype strain of Cystobacter minus and strain Pl fu5 (5DSM 146685JCM 12636) as the
neotype strain of Polyangium fumosum. The proposals of the strains are based on the
descriptions and strain proposals given in the respective chapters of Bergey’s Manual of
Systematic Bacteriology (2005).

An exceptionally high number of myxobacterial species
descriptions is not supported by the availability of formally
acknowledged living type strain material. Because of this
lack of material, the species could not be included, for
example, in species-representing 16S rRNA gene sequence
databases. These are the most frequently used guides in
taxonomy currently, and for that reason, great efforts are
taken to fill the sequencing gaps (Yarza et al., 2013). The
International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (Lapage
et al., 1992) allows for the designation of type strains in
cases where descriptions or dead specimens represent the
type given for species with validly published species names.

paper.

The code also allows for the proposal of neotype strains if a
specimen of the strain on which the original description
was based cannot be found. These measures have been
installed in order to clear the way for inclusion of such
species in future examinations, in particular in studies
including ‘new’ methods which had not been applied at the
time of the species description. In this communication, we
formally designate type strains for seven and formally
propose neotype strains for three species of the order
Myxococcales.
The present wording of Rule 18f of the International Code
is: ‘If a description or illustration constitutes, or a dead
preserved specimen has been designated as the type of a
species [Rule 18a(1)] and a later strain of this species is
cultivated, then the type strain may be designated by the

This type strain shall then replace the description, illustration

designation of a type strain in this manner must be published

publication being determined by the effective and valid

(Thaxter, 1904) are dead herbarium specimens in the
Thaxter collection (TC), housed in the Farlow Herbarium,
Harvard University, Cambridge, USA (Table 1). Howard
McCurdy studied myxobacteria at the University of
Windsor, Ontario, Canada during the period around
1960–1970. He assigned specific samples of the Thaxter
collection as the types of these species (McCurdy, 1971). The

investigations on myxobacteria and were written after
more than 3000 myxobacterial strains had been isolated.
Based on the original species descriptions, appropriate
strains were selected and described as the type strains of the
respective species (Table 1). However, it has not been
formally proposed in the IJSEM until now to accept these
strains as the type strains.

(Skerman et al., 1980). According to a curator of the
herbarium, the specimen for Chondromyces lanuginosus
seems to be lost whereas the other three specimens are still
there, dried on the original substrates, accompanied by some
slides.
For the species Melittangium boletus (Jahn, 1924), Polyangium
sorediatum (Brockman, 1989a) and Polyangium spumosum
(Brockman, 1989a) no physical type strains were assigned in
the Approved Lists (Skerman et al., 1980) or in Validation List
No. 31 (Brockman, 1989b,c), respectively. Instead, the
descriptions of Brockman (1989a) or simply the statement
‘not cultivated’ are given.
Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, second
edition, includes comprehensive chapters about the
members of the order Myxococcales. Reichenbach (2005a,
b, c, d, e) are the chapters relevant to the taxa mentioned in
this paper. These chapters are based on the experience and

For the reason that presently dead preserved material
constitutes-, or a description has been designated-, the type
strain of the mentioned species, or no type strain has been
assigned, it is formally proposed that the strains selected by
Reichenbach shall be designated the type strains of the
respective species according to Rule 18f. The proposed type
strains listed in Table 1 shall replace the dead specimen or
descriptions. These are Chondromyces apiculatus Cm a14T,
Chondromyces crocatus Cm c5T, Chondromyces lanuginosus
Sy t2T, Chondromyces pediculatus Cm p51T, M. boletus Me
b8T, P. sorediatum Pl s12T and P. spumosum Pl sm5T. The
prerequisite for the acceptance of type strains, their deposit
and availability in two culture collections is achieved. The
designation of the type strains is based on the descriptions
given in the respective chapters of Bergey’s Manual
(Reichenbach 2005a, c, d). In order to facilitate the
comparison of these recent descriptions with those of the
authors who originally proposed, revived or emended the
species these original descriptions are assembled in Table
S1 available in IJSEM Online. The fatty acid composition of
the proposed type strains are given in Table S2 (Garcia
et al., 2011). The figures from the original descriptions and
of the proposed type strains are shown face to face with
figures showing the proposed type strains in Figs 1–10.
The Bacteriological Code also allows for the proposal of
neotype strains according to Rule 18c: ‘If a strain on which
the original description was based cannot be found, a
neotype strain may be proposed. A neotype strain must be
proposed (proposed neotype) in the IJSB, together with
citation of the author(s) of the name, a description or

The species Cystobacter ferrugineus, Cystobacter minus and
Polyangium fumosum were first described by Krzemieniewska
& Krzemieniewski (1926, 1927, 1930). McCurdy assigned
three of his isolates as the type strains for the abovementioned three species (McCurdy, 1970; Table 1). The
species names and type strains were included in the
Approved Lists (Skerman et al., 1980) but they have never
been deposited in a culture collection to the best of our
knowledge. In 2007, we wrote a letter to the head of the
microbiology laboratory of the University of Windsor with
the request for subcultures of the strains Cystobacter
ferrugineus M-203T, Cystobacter minus M-307T and P.
fumosum M257T. Even though the importance for microbial
taxonomy was stressed there was no response. In 2012,
another attempt to contact the department at Windsor
University was more successful in the respect that we received
answers from two colleagues at Windsor and from H. D.
McCurdy who retired several years ago. However, they
informed us that they cannot find the samples. Since 1981,
there have been no scientific papers originating from the

University of Windsor dealing with myxobacteria (PubMed),
a fact additionally suggesting that nobody at the university
had a research interest to keep the cultures alive or, at least,
under surveillance. For that reasons we conclude that these
cultures must have been lost.
Since the presently assigned type strains of the mentioned
species are no longer available as living cultures it is formally
proposed that the strains selected by Reichenbach shall be
proposed as the neotype strains of the respective species in
accordance with Rule 18c, as given in Table 1. The deposit
and availability of the neotype strains from two culture
collections is achieved. The proposals of the neotype strains
are based on the suggestions in (Reichenbach (2005b, d). In
these chapters, the strains Cystobacter ferrugineus Cb fe18,
Cystobacter minus Cb m2 and P. fumosum Pl fu5 were
proposed as the type strains according to the species
descriptions given in the respective chapters which rely on
the original species descriptions by Krzemieniewska and
Krzemieniewski and McCurdy (Reichenbach 2005b, d).
However, since type strains have already been assigned these
strains have to be proposed as the neotype strains of the
respective species according to rule 18c.

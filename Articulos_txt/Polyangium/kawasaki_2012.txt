Abstract
Background and aims Biodegradation of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is accelerated in the
presence of plants, due to the stimulation of rhizosphere microbes by plant exudates (nonspecific
enhancement). However, plants may also recruit
specific microbial groups in response to PAH
stress (specific enhancement). In this study, plant
effects on the development of rhizosphere microbial
communities in heterogeneously contaminated soils
were assessed for three grasses (ryegrass, red fescue
and Yorkshire fog) and four legumes (white clover,
chickpea, subterranean clover and red lentil).
Methods Plants were cultivated using a split-root
model with their roots divided between two independent pots containing either uncontaminated soil or
PAH-contaminated soil (pyrene or phenanthrene).
Microbial community development in the two halves
of the rhizosphere was assessed by T-RFLP (bacterial
and fungal community) or DGGE (bacterial community), and by 16S rRNA gene tag-pyrosequencing.

split-root model was significantly influenced by the
presence of PAH-contamination in the other part of the
root system (indirect effect), but this effect was not
seen for grasses. In the contaminated rhizospheres,
Verrucomicrobia and Actinobacteria showed increased
populations, and there was a dramatic increase in
Denitratisoma numbers, suggesting that this genus
may be important in rhizoremediation processes.
Conclusion Our results show that Trifolium and other
legumes respond to PAH-contamination stress in a
systemic manner, to influence the microbial diversity
in their rhizospheres.

Introduction
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a group
of hazardous organic contaminants which are largely
anthropogenic in nature and are ubiquitous in the
environment, especially in industrial soils (Habe and
Omori 2003; Johnsen et al. 2005). Some of these compounds are known human carcinogens (Schneider et al.
2002) and 16 PAHs have been prioritized by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for
environmental regulation (Habe and Omori 2003).
PAH-contaminated soils can be remediated by a variety

170

of physical and chemical processes, but microbial biodegradation is increasingly the remediation method of
choice (Haritash and Kaushik 2009).
Enhanced degradation of organic contaminants
including PAHs is often observed in plant rhizospheres,
a remediation process known as rhizoremediation
(Anderson et al. 1993; Kuiper et al. 2004). Compared
to more traditional bioremediation techniques such as
biostimulation and bioaugmentation, rhizoremediation
possesses several advantages. Rhizoremediation processes are driven by the native microbial community
colonizing the rhizosphere (Kuiper et al. 2004), which is
generally two to four orders of magnitude greater than in
the surrounding bulk soil (Salt et al. 1998). These populations are supported by the plants, which release
10–20% of their photosynthate as root exudates
containing sugars, amino acids and proteins that
serve as nutrient sources for the rhizosphere microbial
community (Kuiper et al. 2004; Salt et al. 1998).
Surfactant-active compounds in the root exudates
increase the solubility of the contaminant and
make it more bioavailable to root colonizing
microorganisms. In addition, the soil water flux
towards the roots, driven by plant transpiration,
provides an effective means by which the contaminant is translocated to the microbial community in
the rhizosphere (Child et al. 2007), and higher
PAH degradation is observed closer to the root
surface (Corgie et al. 2003).
Various studies have demonstrated the effectiveness
of rhizoremediation in PAH-contaminated soils, but
the efficiency of the process varies greatly with plant
species (Lee et al. 2008; Siciliano et al. 2003). Grass
species are generally suitable for rhizoremediation
because they possess a large root biomass that harbours a higher total microbial population than other
species of a comparable size (Chiapusio et al. 2007).
In ryegrass rhizosphere, removal of eight PAHs
ranging from three to six aromatic rings in size
was significantly higher than in unvegetated soil,
and the number of culturable PAH degraders was
also increased (Binet et al. 2000). Leguminous
plants are also well studied for rhizoremediation of
PAH-contaminated soils because of their ability to fix
atmospheric nitrogen. In alfalfa rhizosphere, for
example, removal of anthracene was enhanced 28%
compared to the unplanted control soil, and alfalfa root
exudates were shown to increase the solubilization of
anthracene by 50% (Kim et al. 2004), confirming the

important part that the plant plays in increasing pollutant
bioavailability to the soil microbes.
Root colonizing microorganisms play a major role
in the rhizoremediation process, but the complex interactions that exist between plants and microbes are not
fully understood (Siciliano and Germida 1998). The
simplest explanation of these interactions is that PAH
degradation in the rhizosphere is enhanced “nonspecifically” by the rhizosphere effect, i.e. higher microbial activity in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk
soil affords higher PAH-degradation activity (Siciliano
et al. 2003). Plant root exudates contain many substrates which are chemically similar to pollutants, and
these substrates may act as pollutant analogues to
nonspecifically enhance the rhizoremediation process
(Siciliano and Germida 1998). Allelopathic chemicals
released by plant roots, such as flavonoids and salicin,
are known to induce catabolic enzymes in microorganisms—these enzymes also enhance the degradation of
structurally similar pollutants through cometabolic
processes (Wenzel 2009). However, this is not always
the case, and a range of plant root extracts that enhanced
growth and naphthalene degradation by the naphthalene
degrader Pseudomonas fluorescens HK44 did not lead
to increased specific expression of nahG, encoding
naphthalene dioxygenase. The higher naphthalene
degradation rates observed were due entirely to the
growth stimulation provided by the root extracts
(Kamath et al. 2004).
In addition to the nonspecific enhancement of
PAH degradation described above, there may also
be a specific three-way interaction between plants,
microorganisms and PAHs, i.e. plants may utilize
root colonizing microorganisms to protect themselves from PAH contamination, and may actively
stimulate such organisms in the rhizosphere by
manipulation of exudate flux and composition.
Plants are known to be able to modify rhizosphere
conditions depending on the environment in which
they are growing. In the presence of a chemical
stressor, plants may change the composition or the
amount of root exudation (Walton et al. 1994), and
these changes may be specific drivers in enhancing
pollutant degradation, by altering the microbial
community structure, stimulating the growth of
microorganisms, or increasing microbial catabolic
activities. In addition, specific bacteria may themselves alter the rhizosphere microbial community
indirectly, by influencing plant root exudation flux

and composition (Matilla et al. 2010; Meharg and
Killham 1995; Siciliano and Germida 1997)
In this study, we adopted a split-root model to
examine the ability of a range of grass and legume
species to influence the composition of the fungal and
bacterial rhizosphere communities in response to PAH
stress. Development of total microbial communities in
PAH-contaminated and uncontaminated halves of the
split-rhizospheres was studied and characterized.
Significant differences in the plant response were seen
for legumes and grasses, in two different soils, and
bacterial genera that appeared to be responding to
plant PAH-stress signalling were identified. The
results suggest that legume species respond to
PAH-contamination stress in a systemic manner,
to help determine the rhizosphere community composition under these conditions.
Materials and methods
Soils and media
Sandy loam agricultural topsoils were purchased from
Lindow Turf (Cheshire, UK) or collected from the
University of Sydney’s Lansdowne Farm (Cobbitty,
NSW, Australia; 34°01′19″S 150°40′38″E). They
were sieved before use (2 mm), and stored at 4°C in
the dark. Characterization of critical soil parameters
for the two soils, including mineral nutrient content, is
given in Table 1.
Freshly PAH-contaminated soil was prepared by
adding phenanthrene or pyrene dissolved in acetone
to the sieved soil (Cunliffe and Kertesz 2006). PAH/
acetone solution was first added to 10% of the soil to
give a ten-fold contaminated soil and the solvent was
allowed to evaporate in a fume hood. This soil was

mixed with the remaining 90% of the soil to give final
PAH concentrations of 1,000 μg g−1 soil dry weight
(phenanthrene) or 500 μg g−1 soil dry weight (pyrene).
The water content of the soil was adjusted to 35% of
water-holding capacity (WHC) before use by addition
of sterile tap water. Where required, 1/4 Hoagland’s
solution was used for plant nutrition, containing 1 mM
KNO3, 1 mM NaNO3, 0.75 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM
K 2 SO 4 , 2.1 mM CaCl 2 , 0.307 mM NaH 2 PO 4 ,
0.026 mM Na2HPO4, 8.6 μM MnSO4, 2 μM ZnSO4,
1 μM CuSO4, 50 μM H3BO3, and 10 μM ferric citrate.
Plant growth conditions and construction
of the split-root system
White clover (Trifolium repens), ryegrass (Lolium perenne), red fescue (Festuca rubra), Yorkshire fog
(Holcus lanatus), subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum), red lentil (Lens culinaris var. microsperma),
and chickpea (Cicer arietinum) seeds were purchased
from Emorsgate Seeds (Norfolk, UK) or Heritage Seeds
(Mulgrave, Vic., Australia). Before germination, seeds
were surface sterilized by washing with 70% ethanol for
30 s, 20% (v/v) bleach for 5 min and rinsing 6–7 times
with sterile water. Seeds were then soaked in sterile
water for at least 2 h, and germinated on water agar
(2% (w/v)) for 4 days at 25°C in the dark. The seedlings
were then transplanted onto washed sand and watered
with 1/4 Hoagland’s solution for 10 to 30 days to allow
proliferation of the extensive root system. Once the root
system had grown sufficiently, the seedling was transferred into a small plastic pot (27×27×45 mm) in such a
way that the root system extended from two holes
(approx. 10×25 mm) at the bottom of the pot. The pot
was then filled with sand and stood in 1/4 Hoagland’s
solution for 10 days to encourage further root proliferation. After 10 days, the split-root system was constructed by fixing the small pot containing the
plant onto the middle of two larger pots (38 ×
38×50 mm) (Fig. 1) with the roots extending into
the pots on either side, which contained either PAHcontaminated soil or uncontaminated soil (Table 2).
Split-root treatments were constructed in triplicate,
watered in the bottom pots with autoclaved tap water,
and cultivated for 30 days (clover, fescue and Yorkshire
fog) or 21 days (all other plants) For experiments conducted in the UK, plants were maintained in a growth
chamber (CLF Plant Climatics, Emersacker, Germany)
under controlled conditions (16 h light/8 h dark, 23°C,

light intensity 1,250 μmol.m−2.s−1), while for experiments carried out in Australia, plants were grown in
propagators (38 cm x 24 cm x 18 cm) in a green house
with natural light conditions and the temperature maintained at 23°C. Rhizosphere samples were harvested by
carefully extracting the roots from the bottom pots and
removing excess bulk soil by gentle shaking, and were
stored at −80°C for subsequent analysis.
The treatments were differentiated into heterogeneous treatments, in which the two half-rhizospheres
were exposed to different conditions (designated HetPyr or Het-Phe for the respective contaminated side
and Het-Cpyr or Het-Cphe for the control side), and
homogeneous treatments, in which both sides of the
plant experienced the same treatment, either PAH exposure, (Hom-Pyr or Hom-Phe) or uncontaminated soil
(Hom-C) (Table 2).

rhizosphere DNA was stored at −20°C. The dominant
bacterial taxa in the rhizosphere communities were
identified by tag-pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene
amplification products obtained from triplicate samples. Initial PCR amplification was done using 63F
(AGGCCTAACACATGCAAGTC) and 1087R
(CTCGTTGCGGGACTTACCCC) primers in a total
volume of 50 μl, containing 10 μl PCR Reaction

2 μl of tenfold diluted rhizosphere DNA as the template. After initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, the
reactions were run for 30 cycles of 95°C for 45 s, 55°C
for 45 s, and 72°C for 1 min with a final elongation
step at 72°C for 5 min in an S1000 Thermal Cycler
(Bio-Rad). PCR products were purified using
ISOLATE PCR and Gel Kits (Bioline) and the DNA
concentration was adjusted to 20 ng.μl−1. The purified
PCR products of the triplicate samples were then

pooled, and subjected to tag encoded-pyrosequencing
analysis from the 63F primer, using Roche 454 FLX
Titanium Technology (Research and Testing Laboratories,
Lubbock, Texas). Sequences obtained from the FLX
sequencing runs were filtered as previously described (Acosta-Martinez et al. 2008), to remove
poor quality and short runs, and chimeras. Phylogenetic
assignment was done using a custom database derived
from the RDP-II database (Acosta-Martinez et al. 2008),
with family, genus and species identities set at 89%,
94% and 96% identity, respectively.
Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
(T-RFLP) analysis
T-RFLP analysis of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal
communities was carried out by targeting 16S rRNA
genes and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes
respectively, using primers labelled at the 5′ end with 5carboxyfluorescein (FAM) or hexachlorofluorescein
(HEX). For bacterial communities, T-RFLP was performed with 63 F-FAM and 1087R-HEX primers
(Singh et al. 2008), using the PCR program described
above in a total volume of 50 μl, containing 5 μl PCR
Reaction Buffer (10×, Bioline), 1.5 mM MgCl2 ,
200 μΜ dNTPs, 20 pmol of each primer, 5 μg BSA, 1
unit BIOTAQ DNA polymerase (Bioline), and 2 μl of
10-fold diluted rhizosphere DNA as the template.
Fungal community analysis was done with ITS5-FAM
(GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG) and ITS4HEX (TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC) primers (White
et al. 1990), under the same conditions, but with a
temperature of 54°C in the annealing step. The PCRs
were carried out in a Whatman Biometra T1 thermocycler (Biometra). Four 50 μl reactions were prepared for
each sample, and the combined product was ethanolprecipitated and redissolved at 300 ng DNA μl−1. The
purified PCR product was digested with HhaI restriction
endonuclease (Fermentas) overnight at 37°C, and 0.5 μl
of the digested DNA (75 ng) was mixed with 9.45 ml of
HiDi formamide (Applied Biosystems) and 0.05 μl of
GS500 LIZ size standard (Applied Biosystems).
Capillary electrophoresis of the samples was carried
out using an ABI 3730 automated DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems) with two technical replicates for
each sample (University of Manchester sequencing
unit). Terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) size analysis
was performed using GeneMapper 4.0 (Applied
Biosystems) to define peak size, and the output was

173

further analyzed with T-Align (http://inismor.ucd.
ie/~talign/) to generate a consensus profile of the
T-RF sizes between the technical duplicates and to
compare this profile between the samples (Smith et
al. 2005). Presence or absence of the T-RF was
scored and used for the statistical analysis.
Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)
analysis
The V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was
amplified by PCR using GC-341F (CGCCCGCCGCG
CGCGGCGGGCGGGGCGGGGGCACGGGGGG
CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG) and 518R (ATTACCG
CGGCTGCTGG) primers (Muyzer et al. 1993). The
PCR was carried out in a 50 μl reaction mixture consisting of 10 μl PCR Reaction Buffer A (5×, KAPA
Biosystem), 200 μΜ dNTPs, 20 pmol of each primer, 1
unit KAPA 2 G Robust DNA polymerase (KAPA
Biosystem), and 1 μl of 10-fold diluted rhizosphere
DNA as the template. PCR amplification was carried
out in an S1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad), and consisted of initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed
by 10 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 60°C (reducing by 1°C/
cycle) for 30 s, 68°C for 30 s and a further 20 cycles of
95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, 68°C for 30 s with a final
elongation step at 68°C for 5 min.
DGGE was performed with a DCode 16 cm×16 cm
gel system (Bio-Rad) as described previously (Cunliffe
and Kertesz 2006), with a denaturant gradient of 30–
60%, poured with a gradient mixer. The gel was loaded
(200 ng/sample) and electrophoresis was conducted at
60°C for a total of 1,008 V hours (constant voltage of
63 V for 16 h). After completion, gels were stained with
2 μl SYBR Gold stain (Invitrogen) in 20 ml 1xTAE for
30 min in the dark and then washed briefly with dH2O.
Gel image analysis was carried out with the Quantity
One V4.6.9 software (Biorad).
Extraction of soil PAHs, and quantification by high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
Before extraction of PAHs from soil samples (1 g dry
weight), an internal benzo[ghi]perylene standard (5 μL;
saturated solution in acetonitrile) was added, in order to
quantify extraction efficiency. The soil sample was then
extracted twice in 6 ml of acetone/dichloromethane
(1:1) in an ultrasonic water bath (Ultrawave Limited,
Cardiff, UK) for 10 min, followed by centrifugation in

174

glass centrifuge tubes at 3,600 rpm for 10 min.
The supernatants were combined and the solvents
removed by air blow down at 60°C. The residue
was then re-dissolved in 2 ml of acetonitrile by
ultrasonication for 10 min, centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for
10 min and filtered (0.45 μm nylon syringe filter).
PAHs in the sample were separated by reversedphase HPLC on a Supelcosil LC-PAH column
(Supelco) with a Supelcosil LC-18 Supelguard guard
column (Supelco), using a Dionex HPLC system and
Chromeleon software (Dionex). The mobile phase was
water with a methanol gradient (80 to 100%, vol/vol)
and the flow rate was 1 ml min−1. Pyrene, phenanthrene and benzo[ghi]perylene were detected spectrophotometrically at 254 nm with a Dionex PDA-100
Photodiode Array Detector (Dionex), or by fluorescence with an RF 2000 Fluorescence Detector
(Dionex), using 260 nm excitation wavelength and
420 nm emission wavelength.
Statistical analysis
Presence or absence of T-RFs and DGGE bands
were converted into binary matrices, and non-metric
multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was performed using
IBM SPSS Statistics 19 (IBM) with the Euclidean distance. NMDS results were further subjected to analysis
of similarities (ANOSIM) with the Euclidean distance
using Palaeontological Statistics (PAST) package to
assess the similarities between the rhizosphere microbial
communities.

Results
Impact of heterogeneous PAH contamination
on the bacterial community structure of white clover
rhizospheres
In order to examine indirect, plant-mediated effects of
soil contamination on rhizosphere microbial communities, we constructed a split root experiment with
white clover (T. repens) grown in Lansdowne Farm
soil, and treated with either pyrene (500 μg/g soil) or
phenanthrene (1,000 μg/g soil) under homogeneous or
heterogeneous treatment conditions. Direct effects of
contamination on the microbial community were investigated in the homogeneous split root systems, while
system effects were studied in the heterogeneous

Plant Soil (2012) 358:169–182

systems, by assessing the rhizosphere microbial community structure of each half rhizosphere by DGGE
(Fig. 2a and b). For homogeneous split-root systems,
the bacterial communities present in the pyrenecontaminated and uncontaminated control rhizospheres
(Hom-Pyr and Hom-C) after 30 days were significantly
different from each other (p00.0016) (Fig. 2a). This is
an expected result, and the change in community structure over this time is likely to represent enrichment in
the contaminated rhizosphere of microbial strains that
are either pyrene-resistant or able to degrade the compound. However, when the plant was grown in the
heterogeneous split-root system (one side contaminated
with pyrene and the other side uncontaminated), the
community structure of Het-Cpyr was significantly
different from that of Hom-C (p00.025), and the
microbial communities in the two halves of the
heterogeneous system were much more similar to
each other than to the corresponding Hom-C and
Hom-Pyr controls (Fig. 2a). This suggested that
pyrene contamination of one half of the root system was able to influence microbial community
development in the other half of the system.
Using HPLC and fluorometric detection, we were
unable to detect plant-mediated transfer of pyrene
from the Het-Pyr rhizosphere into the Het-Cpyr
rhizosphere, and this suggests that the effect must
be an indirect one, with the white clover plant
itself responding to pyrene-contamination stress in
a systemic manner to influence the composition of
the rhizosphere bacterial community.
By contrast, in split-root systems contaminated with
phenanthrene, the rhizosphere bacterial communities
were grouped entirely by the presence or absence of
the phenanthrene, with Hom-Phe and Het-Phe showing
significantly different communities from Hom-C and
Het-Cphe (Fig. 2b). The indirect contamination effect
that was seen in the pyrene split-root systems (i.e. HetCpyr significantly different from Hom-C) was not
observed in the phenanthrene split-root system. At the
level of plant yield, white clover also displayed a much
greater level of growth inhibition in response to pyrene
contamination than for phenanthrene contamination,
with 51% (p00.038) and 28% (p00.226) reduction in
the shoot dry weights respectively (n05), suggesting
that the plants were less susceptible to PAH stress from
phenanthrene. This may explain the absence of the
indirect contamination effect on microbial communities
in phenanthrene-treated clover plants.

and 0.0106 respectively, for the two species). This confirms the effect that was seen in the white clover pyrene
split-root system (Fig. 2a). In the red lentil split-root
system, a separation of the bacterial community structure between Het-Cpyr and Hom-C can also be seen in
the NMDS plot (Fig. 2e), but is not statistically significant (p00.1084) (Fig. 2e). Growth of both chickpea
and subterranean clover was significantly affected by
the pyrene contamination, with 27% (p00.005, n05)
and 31% (p00.001, n05) reduction in their shoot
dry weights respectively. Red lentil showed 17%
reduction in its shoot dry weight in response to pyrene
contamination, but this was not statistically significant
(p00.171, n05). As for white clover, the indirect PAH
contamination effect on the rhizosphere microbes is
most apparent when the plant also shows a growth
phenotype caused by the level of PAH applied.
Pyrene degradation in the legume rhizospheres was
also examined, using HPLC with fluorometric detection. In the pyrene-contaminated bulk soil, pyrene
remained stable over the time period, and after 30 days
of soil incubation only 4.9% had been degraded. In the
rhizospheres of chickpea, subterranean clover and red
lentil, by contrast, 16.1%, 22.1% and 32.9% of pyrene,
respectively, had been degraded after 21 days of
incubation.
Specificity of the indirect PAH rhizosphere response
to soil source
Plant-microbe interactions are often decisively influenced by the particular soil in which the plants are
grown. To test whether the indirect PAH response observed above was a general phenomenon, we performed
the white clover split-root experiment in a second soil
(Lindow soil), which was obtained from Lindow Turf,
Cheshire, UK. The plants were cultivated in split-root
systems as before, with pyrene contamination (500 μg/g
soil) where appropriate. Rhizospheres were harvested

Plant Soil (2012) 358:169–182

after 30 days, and total rhizosphere DNA was extracted.
The robustness of the analytical method used was also
tested in this case, by conducting the community analysis with T-RFLP rather than DGGE, followed by a
binary analysis of the T-RFs present, and ordination
analysis as before with NMDS and ANOSIM.
In the split-root system set up with Lindow soil, the
indirect contamination effect on the rhizosphere bacterial community was once again evident (Fig. 3a,
16S; Het-Cpyr significantly different from Hom-C;
p 00.0081). This confirmed the result seen after
growth in Lansdowne Farm soil and demonstrated that
the white clover response to pyrene stress and the
subsequent effect on the rhizosphere bacterial community is not specific to the soil tested. The fungal community in white clover half-rhizospheres was also
analyzed, using T-RFLP targeting the ITS region.
Ordination analysis (NMDS/ANOSIM) showed an apparent separation between the Het-Cpyr and Hom-C
fungal communities (Fig. 3a, ITS), just as it had for
the corresponding bacterial communities (Fig. 3a,
16S), but the difference in the fungal community structures was not statistically-significant (p00.0911).
Heterogeneous PAH contamination does not control
the rhizosphere community structure of grass species
In order to test whether the indirect PAH contamination effect observed above for legumes is also seen in
other plants, we conducted split-root experiments on
three grass species, ryegrass (Lolium perenne), red
fescue (Festuca rubra) and Yorkshire fog (Holcus
lanatus). Initially, we tested ryegrass for the indirect
PAH contamination effect by cultivating it in the splitroot system using Lindow soil with pyrene contamination (500 μg/g soil) for 21 days. T-RFLP analysis of
the ryegrass rhizosphere bacterial communities
showed that the community structures were not affected by pyrene treatment of the other half of the plant
(Het-Cpyr was not significantly different from Hom-C,
Fig. 3b). At this concentration of pyrene (500 μg/g
soil), ryegrass growth showed a 23% reduction in the
shoot dry weight, but it was not significantly inhibited
(p00.084, n05), and we postulated that the absence of
an indirect PAH contamination effect might be due to
insufficient inhibition of ryegrass by pyrene at this
level.
In order to find a PAH concentration that would
affect the plant growth of grass species, red fescue and

Tag sequencing analysis reveals bacterial groups
which respond directly and indirectly to pyrene
contamination in white clover rhizosphere
In order to define which bacterial groups respond to
pyrene contamination directly, and which respond indirectly, 16S tag pyrosequencing was carried out on the
white clover split-root rhizosphere samples grown in the
Lindow soil. A total of 9,052 valid sequences were
obtained from Het-Pyr, Het-Cpyr, Hom-Pyr and
Hom-C rhizosphere samples. The most dominant
bacterial group in all rhizospheres was Proteobacteria
(Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Deltaproteobacteria), which
represented 55–70% of the total bacterial community.
Increased Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia populations were observed in Het-Pyr and Hom-Pyr,
suggesting that these two phyla respond directly to

the pyrene contamination. Meanwhile, a decrease
in Gammaproteobacteria was observed in Het-Pyr
and Hom-Pyr (Fig. 4), suggesting that members of
this taxon have higher sensitivity to pyrene contamination than other phyla. At the genus level,
Denitratisoma genotypes were enriched in the
presence of pyrene, and made up the most abundant
genus in Het-Pyr and Hom-Pyr. Bacillus appeared to
respond indirectly to pyrene stress via the plant, as the
proportion of Bacillus sequences increased from 3% in
Hom-C to 9% in Het-Cpyr (Table 3), and members
of this genus may be responding to specific metabolites released by the plant when subjected to
pyrene stress.

Discussion
Enhanced microbial PAH degradation in plant rhizospheres has been demonstrated before, but the complex interactions between the plant and the rootcolonizing microbes that occur during the rhizoremediation process still remain unclear. A three-way
interaction between plant, microbe and pollutant

Yorkshire fog were initially examined by growing in
soil contaminated by pyrene (500 μg/g) or phenanthrene (1,000 μg/g soil). Red fescue and Yorkshire fog
growth was significantly affected by the pyrene contamination, which resulted in 34% (p00.007, n05)
and 37% (p00.016, n05) reduction in their shoot dry
weights respectively. However, phenanthrene contamination showed a greater effect on the plant
growth, reducing red fescue shoot dry weight by
56% (p00.001, n05) and Yorkshire fog shoot dry
weight by 47% (p00.000, n05). Therefore, we conducted split-root experiments on red fescue and
Yorkshire fog in the Lindow soil with 1,000 μg/g soil
phenanthrene contamination. The plants were cultivated
for 30 days and the rhizosphere bacterial and fungal
communities were analyzed with T-RFLP. Although
growth of both grass species was significantly affected
by the phenanthrene contamination, ordination analysis
(NMDS/ANOSIM) showed that bacterial and fungal
community structures could only be grouped by the
presence or absence of phenanthrene (Hom-Phe and
Het-Phe were significantly different from Hom-C and
Het-Cphe, p<0.05) (Fig. 3c & d). The indirect PAH
contamination effect which was seen in white clover
(Het-Cpyr significantly different from Hom-C) was not
observed in either bacterial or fungal communities in
grass rhizospheres. This result indicates that the indirect PAH contamination effect on the rhizosphere
community via the plant is not observed in all plants,
and more work is required to delineate the range of
this phenomenon.

has been suggested, in which a plant that detects
pollution in the soil may respond by changing the
rate or composition of root exudation, thereby
stimulating pollutant degradation by the rhizosphere microbes (Walton et al. 1994) and possibly
recruiting specific pollutant degraders to its rhizosphere (Siciliano and Germida 1998). In this study,
we show that legumes demonstrate considerable
influence over the microbial community composition in their rhizospheres in response to PAH contamination, while this effect was much less
pronounced for the three grasses studied.
The concept of the split-root system has been used in
a wide range of studies, mainly investigating plant
responses to environmental biotic and abiotic stressors,
and for elucidating shoot-root signalling in nutrient
uptake and transport. For instance, split-root systems
have been applied to study the rhizodeposition of
legume-derived N into the soil (Schmidtke 2005), and
the suppression of nodule development on soybeans
(Kosslak and Bohlool 1984). However, so far there are
only few published studies that apply split-root systems
for studying rhizoremediation of contaminated soils.
Langer et al. (2010) used a split-root system to study

the effect of heterogeneous hydrocarbon pollution and
arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization on
bush bean growth and root morphology, by contaminating one side of the split-root system with crude
oil, or inoculating it with AMF. Heterogeneous pollutant
exposure or AMF colonization caused different plant
responses to homogeneous conditions (polluted or nonpolluted). In the heterogeneous polluted condition,
increases in root biomass, root length and foliar phosphorus content were observed compared to the homogeneous conditions.
In this study, we assessed the shift in the rhizosphere microbial population in various plant species
during rhizoremediation of PAH-contaminated soils.
Our findings suggest that legume species specifically
influenced their rhizosphere microbial composition in
response to PAH stress. When white clover, chickpea
and subterranean clover were cultivated with pyrene
contamination in one side of the split-root system, the
microbial population in the counterpart uncontaminated rhizosphere (Het-Cpyr) was significantly different
from that observed when the plants were grown in
homogeneous uncontaminated control conditions
(Hom-C) (Fig. 2a, c & d, Fig. 3a). In principle, this

180

could be explained by a transfer of contaminant from
one side of the plant to the other, either through
capillary action or plant-mediated transfer. Trifolium
is indeed known to be able to uptake PAH to their
roots, but translocation to the shoots is very restricted
and the concentration of PAH in the shoots is 100
times lower than in the roots (Gao et al. 2008). A
similar effect also occurs in wheat, with no phenanthrene transported to the shoots from the roots (Li et
al. 2001). In our heterogeneous contaminated splitroot system we were unable to detect PAH in the
uncontaminated rhizosphere, and it is therefore unlikely that the change in microbial community was due to
direct PAH transfer from one side of the plant to the
other in the split-root system. A plausible alternative
mechanism is that leguminous plants change their
exudation, qualitatively or quantitatively, in response
to the PAH stress, and that this specifically influences
the rhizosphere microbial community.
Plants are known to change their root exudation in
response to various environmental stresses. A study on
the effect of phenanthrene contamination on sorghum
root exudation showed that when the plant was grown
in a high concentration of phenanthrene (100 mg/kg),
the total amount of exuded compounds decreased by
78%, due to phenanthrene damaging the root system.
The composition of the root exudates was, however,
qualitatively the same as for the control plant
(Muratova et al. 2009a), though the activities of three
oxidoreductases (oxidase, peroxidase, and tyrosinase)
were increased in the presence of phenanthrene
(Muratova et al. 2009b). The composition and flux
of exudate is also strongly dependent on the presence
of microbes in the rhizosphere (Meharg and Killham
1995; Siciliano and Germida 1997), and these
microbe-induced changes in exudate quality may also
directly affect pollutant degradation in the rhizosphere. Exudates from Trifolium plants have been
shown to enhance rhizosphere degradation of 2,4dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), but only when
the exudates were harvested from plants grown in
the presence of microorganisms (Shaw and Burns
2005a). This stimulatory effect observed for
Trifolium exudates may be related to the indirect
PAH-induced community shift we report in this paper,
since it was very much stronger for legumes than for
other plant species (Shaw and Burns 2004). The effect
was clearly linked to an exudate or root-debris associated factor and the authors proposed that flavonoids

Plant Soil (2012) 358:169–182

might play an integral role, but this could not be
directly confirmed. In contrast to the results reported
here, the increase in 2,4-D degradation varied greatly
between soil types (Shaw and Burns 2005b), and no
change in the diversity of 2,4-D degrading rhizosphere
bacteria was observed, at least at the level of the tfdA
gene (Shaw and Burns 2004).
Plant root exudates can also modify microbial community composition in PAH-contaminated soils.
When ryegrass root exudates were added to a
phenanthrene-contaminated soil, the population of
Gram negative bacteria possessing PAH ring hydroxylating dioxygenase genes was significantly increased
compared to the same contaminated soil without
addition of exudates, and the diversity of the genes
also differed between the exudate-treated and untreated
soils (Cébron et al. 2011). Similarly, the diversity of
aromatic ring-cleavage genes in PAH-contaminated
birch rhizospheres was double that found in the
surrounding PAH-contaminated bulk soils (Sipilä et
al. 2008).
Plants only show their responses to the contaminant
when they are exposed to levels above a “threshold
concentration” of the contaminant (Muratova et al.
2009a). In this study, we confirmed that only legume
species whose growth was inhibited by the PAH concentration tested showed responses to the PAH contamination by modifying their rhizosphere microbial
populations. This response was clearly seen in the
significant differences observed between Hom-C
microbial communities and Het-Cpyr communities in
the heterogeneous split-root systems, which suggests
that the plant senses PAH contamination at Het-Pyr,
and releases stress response signals to modify the
microbial community structure of Het-Cpyr even when
there is no PAH present there. This result provides
clear experimental evidence for the importance of
a three-way plant-microbe-pollutant interaction during
the rhizoremediation process, as suggested by Walton et
al. (1994).
Analysis of the bacterial communities in the white
clover rhizospheres by tag-pyrosequencing (Fig. 4)
identified several groups of bacteria that are directly
enhanced by pyrene contamination, and others that are
indirectly enhanced by pyrene contamination via the
plant. In the pyrene-contaminated rhizospheres, HetPyr and Hom-Pyr, increased Actinobacteria and
Verrucomicrobia populations were observed (Fig. 4),
indicating that these two phyla were benefiting from

Plant Soil (2012) 358:169–182

pyrene or pyrene degradation products. It is not surprising that Actinobacteria were enriched in the presence of pyrene since many Mycobacterium species are
well known PAH degraders, and also colonize plant
roots (Child et al. 2007). Mycobacterium was one of
the 15 commonest genera observed in Het-Pyr and
Hom-Pyr rhizospheres, but it was not found in the
uncontaminated Het-Cpyr and Hom-C rhizospheres
(Table 3). Verrucomicrobia are widely distributed in
soil environments, making up 1–10% of bacterial 16S
rRNA in soils, but only very few of these organisms
have been isolated (Sangwan et al. 2005). Their ecological roles remain unclear, but it has previously been
reported that they are negatively affected by PAH
contamination and do not survive in PAH-contaminated
soil (Yrjälä et al. 2010). This is contrary to our finding
that Verrucomicrobia were stimulated in the presence of
pyrene, and also to another study which reported that
PAH-contaminated soil planted with alfalfa specifically
favoured the development of Verrucomicrobia and
Actinobacteria (Cébron et al. 2009). This may suggest
that although Verrucomicrobia are inhibited by PAH
contamination in the bulk soil, they are stimulated by
compounds that the plant releases in response to PAH
stress. This plant response is presumably local, and not
systemic, since we did not observe stimulation of
Verrucomicrobia in the Het-Cpyr rhizosphere. In the
pyrene-contaminated rhizospheres (Het-Pyr and
Hom-Pyr), the bacterial population was dominated
by the Denitratisoma genus (Table 3). This genus
was first reported in 2006 as the new species
Denitratisoma oestradiolicum, a denitrifying organism related to Azoarcus and Thauera that was
isolated from activated sludge of a wastewater
treatment plant with 17-β-estradiol as the sole
carbon source (Fahrbach et al. 2006). Little is yet
known about this genus, but a related strain, with 95%
16SrRNA gene sequence identity to Denitratisoma oestradiolicum, was shown to utilize p-xylene as the sole
carbon source under denitrifying conditions (Rotaru et
al. 2010). Since the genus Denitratisoma was considerably enriched in our heterogeneously contaminated rhizospheres in the presence of pyrene (Table 3), this may
suggest a potential of this genus for rhizoremediation
applications.

Abstract
In this study we evaluated the bacterial diversity in a soil sample from a site next to a chemical industrial factory previously
contaminated with heavy metals. Analysis of 16S rDNA sequences ampliﬁed from DNA directly extracted from the soil revealed
17 diﬀerent bacterial types (genera and/or species). They included Polyangium spp., Sphingomonas spp., Variovorax spp., Haﬁna spp.,
Clostridia, Acidobacteria, the enterics and some uncultured strains. Microbes able to tolerate high concentrations of cadmium (500
µmol/L and above) were also isolated from the soil. These isolates included strains of Acinetobacter (strain CD06), Enterobacter
sp. (strains CD01, CD03, CD04 and CD08) (similar strains also identiﬁed in culture-independent approach) and a strain of
Stenotrophomonas sp. The results indicated that the species identiﬁed from direct analysis of 16S rDNA of the soil can be quite
diﬀerent from those strains obtained from enrichment cultures and the microbial activities for heavy metal resistance might be more
appropriately addressed by the actual isolates.
Key words: cadmium; heavy metal; heavy metal resistant; microbial diversity; soil bacteria

Introduction
Heavy metal contamination is a common environmental
problem which presents a signiﬁcant health hazard and
requires expensive cleanup costs. The input of these pollutants into the environment has signiﬁcantly increased
due to the irresponsible disposal of wastes by various
industries. Agricultural ﬁelds contaminated with the heavy
metal cadmium have been a particular concern since it
results in the contamination of the agricultural products
such as rice. Additionally, heavy metals can accumulate in
biological systems and ultimately be introduced into food
web via diﬀerent mechanisms (Giller et al., 1998). Metals
are a signiﬁcant toxic factor to biota in the environment in
their free ionic forms. However, studies on bacterial diversity in heavy metal contaminated sites still demonstrated
a high diversity of microorganisms (Dean-Ross and Mills,
1989; Hattori 1992; Gelmi et al., 1994; Roane and Kellogg,
1996; Filali et al., 2000; Ellis et al., 2003; Konstantinidis
et al., 2003). They are indigenous organisms that have
not only adapted to the new environments but have also
ﬂourished under them (Haq and Shakoori, 2000; Roane
and Pepper, 2000). Microorganisms possess a variety of
mechanisms to deal with high concentrations of heavy
metals and often are speciﬁc to one or a few metals

(Silver and Mistra, 1988; Silver and Phung, 1996; Mejare
and Bulow, 2001; Nies, 2003; Piddock, 2006). Therefore,
speciﬁc heavy metal resistant determinants can be used as
parameters for environmental forensic as biosensors (Haq
and Shakoori, 2000; Zhou, 2003; Verma and Singh, 2005).
The required methods to most reliably determine the
bacterial diversity of an environment is often hotly debated. It is widely accepted that the enrichment culture
approach only identiﬁes a small proportion of microorganisms in any given sample. And these are usually the
organisms that grow best under the enrichment conditions
provided. On the other hand, the use of nucleic acidbased methods including biochips is believed to be more
appropriate for the assessment of microbial community
than those based on culturing techniques (Ovreas and
Torsvik, 1998). Unfortunately, there are drawbacks of
these culture-independent approaches such as the relevance of the microbial activities to the metal pollutants
can not be totally elucidated. Study on the relationship
between the diversity of the culturable portion of the
microbial community and the microbial diversity obtained
by direct ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA genes from soil
have been discussed (Ellis et al., 2003). Also from the
application of bioremediation point of view, the isolation
of the microorganisms and the bacterial eﬀects in the
removal of heavy metals is essential.
In this study, we studied the bacterial diversity of a soil

sample from an agricultural ﬁeld previously contaminated
with heavy metals. Examination of the microbiota was
carried out both by direct ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA genes
from the sample as well as cultivation of the microorganisms. As expected, our result indicated that the species
identiﬁed from direct analysis of 16S rDNA genes of the
soil was quite diﬀerent from those strains obtained from
enrichment cultures. All the isolates showed robust-growth
in the medium containing relative high concentration of
heavy metals. This suggests that from the application point
of view, only the “actual” isolation of microorganisms may
provide the ability to study the relationship between in situ
microbial activities and those isolates able to be used for
bioremediation applications.

1 Materials and methods
1.1 Experimental soil
The experiment was conducted with soil from an agricultural ﬁeld contaminated with heavy metals in Lu-Chu,
Taoyuan, Taiwan, due to the wastewater discharged to irrigation channel from a chemical industrial factory nearby in
1980s. Although the ﬁeld was under remediation process in
late 1990s, the farmland is still not available for agriculture
until recently. The sample was collected from the top 5–
20 cm layer of the ﬁeld. The pH of the collected sample
was 4.6 and the organic carbon content was 3.7%. The
composition of the sample was 28% sand, 42% silt and
30% clay. The concentration of heavy metals was 3 mg/kg
for cadmium and 115 mg/kg for chromium. The analysis
of the soil was conducted by soil survey and testing center,
“National” Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan,
China.
1.2 Isolation of cadmium resistant bacteria
Bacteria were isolated from soil described above using
Luria Bertani (LB) broth medium supplemented with 500
µmol/L CdCl2 (Lennox, 1955). Soil (0.5 g) was inoculated
into 250-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂask containing 50 ml medium
and incubated at 30°C with shaking (150 r/min) to maintain
aerobic conditions. Pure cultures were obtained on the
same medium solidiﬁed by addition of Bacto agar (BD
Diagnostics, Sparks, MD, USA).

Vol. 20

universal primers F24 (Forward AGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG) and F25 (Reverse, AAGGAGGTGWTCCARCC) as described (Dewhirst et al., 1999). The PCR (20
µl) contained 1 µl of the DNA preparation, 1X Taq polymerase buﬀer (provided by the manufacturer), 1 mmol/L
of each forward and reverse primer, 200 mmol/L of each
deoxynucleotide (ddATP, ddGTP, ddCTP and ddTTP) and
Taq polymerase (Yeastern Biotech Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) 2.5 U. PCR conditions were as follows: 95°C for
5 min followed by ampliﬁcation in which the following
conditions were used: denaturation at 95°C for 45 s,
annealing at 55°C for 60 s and elongation for 90 s at
72°C with an additional 10 min at 72°C for each cycle
for the 30 cycles. The PCR products obtained from DNA
extracted from soil were ﬁrst analyzed by electrophoresis
in 1% agarose gel and was stained with ethidium bromide
and visualized under short-wavelength UV light. Puriﬁed
PCR products (about 1.5 kb) were then inserted into a
commercial plasmid vector yT&A (Yeastern Biotech.
Co., Ltd., Taiwan) and then transformed into competent
Escherichia coli DH5α. Random selected clones were
sequenced using a LICOR IR2 4200 DNA sequencer (LICOR, Lincoln, NE, USA) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Puriﬁed PCR products obtained from pure
cultures of the isolates were also subjected for sequencing
as described. Sequences obtained were compared to the
non-redundant nucleotide database at the National Center
for Biotechnology Information by using their World Wide
Website, and the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search
Tool) algorithm.
1.5 Heavy metal tolerance of isolated strains
To examine the ability of the isolate strains to resist
heavy metals, cells of strains CD01, CD06 and CD08
were grown in 250-ml Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 50 ml
of LB medium supplemented with 500 mol/L of heavy
metals (Cd in CdCl2 , Cr in K2 Cr2 O7 , Ni in NiSO4 , Zn
in ZnSO4 , Pb in Pb(NO3 )2 , and Cu in CuSO4 ). Cultures
were incubated at 30°C with shaking to maintain aerobic
conditions. Cell growth was determined as measurements
of optical density at 600 nm (OD600 nm ). Another isolate
(a strain of Stenotrophomonas) possess a peculiar ability
for heavy metal resistance and was published elsewhere
(Chien et al., 2007).

1.3 DNA extraction from the soil and bacterial isolates
Bacterial DNA was extracted directly from soil using the SoilMaster™ DNA extraction kit (Epicentre
Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was also extracted directly from soil using bead beater and hot detergent
treatment (Kuske et al., 1998). For pure cultures, cells
were harvested and washed twice with 1 ml of sterile
phosphate-buﬀered saline and the DNA was extracted from
cell pellets by Triton-Prep method.
1.4 Ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA genes by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and analysis of the PCR
products
The 16S rDNA genes were ampliﬁed with bacterial

2 Results and discussion
2.1 Bacterial diversity determined by culture-independent 16S rDNA analysis
From the selected clones with insertion of direct ampliﬁcation of 16S rDNA from soil, seventeen diﬀerent
microbial types (genera and/or species) were identiﬁed
from 40 random selected clones. They include bacteria
belong to genera Polyangium, Sphingomonas, Variovorax,
Haﬁna, Clostridia, Acidobacteria, bacteria belonging to
the members of Enteribacteriaceae and some uncultured
strains. The identities were determined by partial 16S
rDNA sequence analysis of these representative clones and
sequence accession numbers are shown in Table 1. The

genera that are closely related to the clones as determined
by the similarity the alignments of partial 16S rDNA
sequences in this study are also shown in Table 1.
2.2 Identiﬁcation of cultured cadmium resistant microorganisms
Six strains of bacteria able to grow in the presence of
cadmium (at least 500 µmol/L) were isolated from the
soil sample. The partial 16S rDNA sequences of these
bacteria were compared with the 16S rDNA sequences
available in the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology
Information, Bethesda, MD, USA) public database. The
results showed that the six isolates belonged to three different groups of bacteria. One of the isolates was identiﬁed
as a Stenotrophomonas sp. and was published elsewhere
since it has peculiar characteristics for cadmium resistance
and antibiotic resistance (Chien et al., 2007). The other
strains were identiﬁed as Enterobacter sp. (designed as
strain CD01, CD03, CD04 and CD08) and Acinetobacter
sp. (designed as strain CD06), respectively. The nucleotide
sequence of partial 16S rDNA of strains CD06 and CD08
have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers EF198175 and EF198176, respectively.
2.3 Heavy metal resistance levels of strains CD01, CD06
and CD08
Strains CD01, CD06 and CD08 were able to resist to a
variety of heavy metals. Strains CD01 and CD08 showed

361

the same pattern of heavy metal resistance, which also
indicated these isolates maybe the same strains (Enterobacter sp.). Table 2 shows the ability of strain CD08
grown in medium containing diﬀerent heavy metals. Strain
CD06 was identiﬁed as an Acinetobacter sp., and is most
closely related to Acinetobacter radioresistens by 16S
rDNA sequence alignment. A. radioresistens capable of
degrading aromatic compounds has been reported to be
sensitive to heavy metals regardless the bacterium possessed abundant plasmids (Pessione and Giunta, 1997). In
contrast, strain CD06 is able to resist to a variety of heavy
metals to rather high concentrations (Table 2). We also
examined A. radioresistence ATCC15425 for its ability
to resist cadmium and a much lower minimum inhibitory
concentration was observed (500 µmol/L) compared to that
of strain CD06 (1500 µmol/L). This has been also noticed
in Stenotrophomonas sp. in which the strain isolated from
heavy metal contaminated soil demonstrated much higher
tolerance to heavy metals than those obtained from culture
collection (Chien et al., 2007). The growth curves of strain
CD06, CD08 and an E. coli in the medium without addition
of heavy metals in comparison to the growth curve in
the medium supplemented with selected concentrations
of diﬀerent heavy metals are shown in Fig.1. The results
showed that compared to the heavy metal resistant strains,
E. coli did not grow in the medium containing Cd and Cr,
and also had remarkably reduced growth in the medium

containing other heavy metals examined.
From the enrichment culture, four out of six isolates
were identiﬁed as Enterobacter sp. according to the 16S
rDNA sequence similarity. Bacteria belong to Enterobacteriaceae were also identiﬁed in the culture-independent
approach in higher proportion compared to many other
type of microorganisms. The other microorganism that
was identiﬁed from culture-independent approach with the
highest proportion was bacteria belong to Clostridiales.
We did not employ anaerobic culturing techniques for our
enrichment culture isolation, therefore, no Clostridium and
related microorganisms were isolated in this study. However, anaerobic microorganisms unquestionably are one of
the most signiﬁcant communities in such environment, and
may also valuable for further bioremediation applications.
Heavy metals resistant traits are often carried by plasmids. Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella sp. isolated
from industrial eﬄuents capable to resist to heavy metals
were demonstrated to harbor related plasmids (Haq et al.,
1999). An attempt to isolate plasmids was unsuccessful.
Further investigation is required for the conﬁrmation of
the presence of the plasmids as well as the mechanisms
of heavy metals resistance of these isolates.

3 Conclusions
The microbial diversity in a soil sample from a site
next to a chemical industrial factory previously heavily contaminated with cadmium was examined by both
culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches.
Three diﬀerent types of microorganisms that resist to
high level of heavy metals were isolated in pure cultures.
However, seventeen types of microbes were identiﬁed by
culture-independent method. The diﬀerent results between

culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches
were due to both enrichment culture techniques bias and
the relevance of the microbial resistant to the metal pollutants may not be totally relevant in culture-independent
results. However, from the application of bioremediation
point of view, the isolation of the microorganisms and
the bacterial eﬀects on the removal of heavy metals are
essential.

Abstract
The diversity of myxobacteria present in campus garden soil was surveyed by both cultivation-based and cultivation-independent
methods. Detailed phylogenetic analysis of cultured and uncultured myxobacteria 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that many undescribed relatives of the myxobacteria exist in nature. Molecular systematic analyses also revealed that myxobacterial genera described to
date on the basis of the morphology of multi-cellular fruiting bodies were mostly monophyletic. However, these known taxa comprised
only in a small part of the sequences recovered directly from soil in a cultivation-independent approach, indicating that the group is much
more diverse than previously thought. We propose that the myxobacteria exist in two forms: the fruiting and the non-fruiting types. Most
of the uncultured myxobacteria may represent taxa which rarely form fruiting bodies, or may lack some or all of the developmental genes
needed for fruiting body formation. In order to identify non-fruiting myxobacteria, new morphology-independent cultivation and isolation techniques need to be developed.

1. Introduction
Myxobacteria are Gram-negative gliding bacteria
(McCurdy, 1989) whose cells grow cooperatively on a food
source, and can then form multi-cellular, myxospore-containing fruiting bodies after exhaustion of the food supply
(Dworkin, 1996; Shimkets, 1990). As a result of their specialist lifestyle, myxobacteria are able to live in many
places. They prefer to grow in the soil, the dung of herbivores, in bark and in rotting wood (Dawid, 2000; Reichenbach, 1999). Cultivation strategies for myxobacteria
usually involve incubation of natural samples on a selective, agar-containing medium, followed by cell swarming
and fruiting body formation; occasionally, fruiting bodies
themselves can be collected from nature (Dawid, 2000; Reichenbach and Dworkin, 1992). However, fruiting body formation is but one stage of their life cycle, and these

structures often quickly collapse after their formation (Reichenbach and Dworkin, 1992). As a result, the distribution
and diversity of myxobacteria in nature is still substantially
unclear more than a century after they were ﬁrst described
by Thaxter in 1892.
The present taxonomy of myxobacteria is based solely
on cultured, fruiting myxobacteria. After several updates,
the recognized myxobacteria are now classiﬁed into three
suborders, six families, 17 genera and approximately 50
species (Reichenbach, 2004; Shimkets et al., 2005). Compared to previous classiﬁcations (McCurdy, 1989; Reichenbach, 1993), new myxobacterial taxa have recently been
described either from new isolates, reclassiﬁcation of misplaced taxa after phylogenetic analysis of their 16S rRNA
gene sequences, or identiﬁcation of novel and distinguishing morphological characteristics. For instance, the present
suborder Sorangineae contains six genera, Haploangium
(now identiﬁed as Polyangium by Reichenbach in 2004),
Chondromyces, Polyangium, Sorangium and two new
genera Byssophaga (a cellulose-degrading myxobacterium

initially identiﬁed by Thaxter in 1897 and rediscovered by
Reichenbach in 2004) and Jahnia (Jahnia thaxteri, previously termed Polyangium thaxteri). The genus Nannocystis,
which had been placed in the suborder Sorangineae has
now been elevated to form a new suborder Nannocystineae, together with the halophilic or slightly halophilic
myxobacterial strains that were recently isolated from Japanese coastal areas (Iizuka et al., 1998, 2003a,b; Fudou
et al., 2002), as well as a newly renamed species Koﬂeria
ﬂava (previously Polyangium vitellinum Pl vt1) (Reichenbach, 2004). The more recently described myxobacteria
usually have special properties reﬂecting unique habitats.
For instance, Sanford et al. (2002) isolated anaerobic
myxobacteria strains from soil which were classiﬁed as
members of the suborder Cystobacterineae, based on their
ability to grow using acetate as an electron donor and
2-chlorophenol as an electron acceptor. These and other
unusual myxobacteria have broadened our understanding
of the taxonomy of the group, which has yet to be explored
in detail. For example, even when using conventional
methods, Watve et al. (1999) found that the number of
myxobacteria in soil samples from India was probably several-fold higher than the number of samples typically
recovered elsewhere.
Interestingly, recently isolated strains do not usually
have typical myxobacterial morphological characteristics,
but instead have atypical or inconspicuous fruiting body
structures. We surmise that there may be many other bacteria within the myxobacterial clade that have yet to be discovered because they form fruiting bodies rarely, or not at
all. In our previous work, we explored the diversity of the
myxobacterial suborder, Cystobacterineae in soil by using
both conventional isolation as well as cultivation-independent, molecular phylogenetic methods (Wu et al., 2005).
On the one hand, from the soil sample we were able to isolate only ﬁve Cystobacterineae strains (two Myxococcus
spp., two Corallococcus spp. and a Cystobacter sp.) using
classical isolation techniques (in addition a Nannocystis
sp. and a Sorangium sp. of the suborder Sorangineae were
also identiﬁed). By contrast, cloning and sequencing 16S
rRNA gene sequences from the same soil sample using
myxobacteria-speciﬁc primers revealed that far greater
diversity was present. Fifty-three Cystobacterineae-related
clones were sequenced and could be divided into at least
12 subgroups (with 95% or less sequence similarity), of
which four spanned the diversity of all previously described
members of this suborder. This result indicated that there
are many undiscovered, greatly diversiﬁed myxobacteria
in nature. In the present study, after a further molecular
survey of the suborder Sorangineae in soil, we carried out
a detailed phylogenetic analysis of both cultured and
uncultured myxobacteria. Our data suggest that the myxobacteria exist in nature in two forms: fruiting and nonfruiting types, which probably correspond to cultured
and uncultured myxobacteria. The phylogenetic diversity,
molecular taxonomy and classiﬁcation of this interesting
bacterial group is also discussed.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Construction of a Sorangineae-enriched 16S rRNA gene
library from a soil sample
The total DNA surveyed for the construction of a
Sorangineae-enriched 16S rRNA gene library was the same
as that used in the surveying of uncultured Cystobacterineae sequences reported previously (Wu et al., 2005).
Brieﬂy, the soil sample was ground with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. The ground soil was mixed with
an extraction buﬀer (100 mM Tris–HCl; 100 mM EDTA;
100 mM sodium phosphate; 1.5 M NaCl; 1% [w/v] CTAB;
pH 8.0) containing 1 mg/ml protease K, and was then subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles followed by incubation at
65 C for 2 h. Following extraction with chloroform–isopentanol, total DNA was precipitated with 0.6 vol of cold
isopentanol, washed with 70% ice-cold ethanol, and puriﬁed on a Sephedex G-200 column.
We designed speciﬁc primers (Wu et al., 2005) for 16S
rRNA genes of the suborders Cystobacterineae and
Sorangineae to determine the diversity of myxobacteria in
the environment. Identiﬁcation of group-speciﬁc primers
was possible because cultivated members of these suborders do not display that much sequence divergence in this
gene (Spröer et al., 1999; Yan et al., 2003). By contrast,
it was not possible to design a primer set speciﬁc for 16S
rRNA genes of members of the new suborder Nannocystineae (only 19 entries in GenBank) due to our inability to
identify conserved sequence that was diagnostic for the
group. Members of the Nannocystineae are more diverse
in both 16S rDNA sequence content and fruiting body
morphology (Reichenbach, 2004). The primer set of
Sorangineae speciﬁc W4 (GTA AGA CAG AGG GTG
CAA ACG T; corresponding to positions 492–510 of the
16S rRNA in Escherichia coli, Brosius et al., 1978) and bacterial universal Pr (GGC TGG ATC ACC TCC TTT CT;
corresponding to the position of 1524–1541 bp) was evaluated initially by using DNA from pure bacterial cultures as
references. At an annealing temperature of 69 C, all the
Sorangineae cultures were ampliﬁed, whereas the Cystobacterineae strains and the negative controls E. coli and
Methylobacterium sp. 0093-1 were not ampliﬁed. E. coli
produced positive signals with the primer set at an annealing temperature lower than 64 C, and Methylobacterium
sp. 0093-1 at a temperature lower than 67 C. Accordingly,
the primer set W4/Pr was used to amplify Sorangineaeenriched 16S rRNA gene sequences from the soil community DNA using a touchdown PCR protocol (Wu et al.,
2005) to increase the diversity of Sorangineae products.
The products were about 1000 bp in length. The ampliﬁed
products containing 16S rRNA gene sequences were puriﬁed using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, USA)
and were ligated with pGEM-T easy Vector (Promega,
USA) following the protocols recommended by the manufacturer. They were electroporated into E. coli JM109 using
the published procedure (Sambrook and Russell, 2001).

D.-M. Jiang et al. / Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 44 (2007) 545–552

About 3000 white transformants were collected and stored
as a Sorangineae-enriched 16S rRNA gene library.
2.2. In situ colony hybridization and sequencing
The oligonucleotide probe W5 (GTA AGA CAG AGG
GTG CAA ACG T; corresponding to positions 529-550 of
16S rRNA in E. coli) speciﬁc for the suborder Sorangineae
was labeled at the 30 -end with ﬂuorescein-dUTP by terminal transferase in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions for the Gene Image 30 -oligolabeling module
(Amersham Biosciences, USA). To evaluate and optimize
conditions for in situ colony hybridization, slot blot hybridization was performed with W5. The 16S rRNA gene PCR
products from pure myxobacteria strains were blotted onto
a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences, USA).
The membrane was soaked in the hybridization buﬀer [5·
SSC; 0.1% (w/v) SDS; 20-fold dilution of liquid block supplied with the kit and 0.5% (w/v) dextran sulphate (MW
500,000)] for 1 h at a selected temperature. After the addition of 5 ng/ml of labeled oligonucleotide probe, the
hybridization process was performed overnight. When the
hybridization temperature was 61 C, the 16S rRNA gene
PCR products from Sorangineae strains produced obvious
hybridization signals, while there were no signals for
Cystobacterineae strains, E. coli or Methylobacterium sp.
0093-1. When the hybridization temperature was reduced
to 58 C, the Cystobacterineae strains produced weak signals, while there were still no signals for E. coli or Methylobacterium sp. 0093-1. To obtain maximum diversity, the
lower stringency hybridization temperature of 58 C was
employed. After hybridization, the membrane was washed
twice in 5· SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature, for
5 min each time, and then washed twice in 1· SSC, 0.1%
(w/v) SDS at 50 C, for 15 min each time. The Gene Image
CDP-Star detection module (Amersham Biosciences, USA)
was used to detect the hybridization signal following the
manufacture’s instruction. KODAK X-OMAT AR
(XAR5) ﬁlms were exposed to the blots between intensifying screens for 1 h. Eighty-ﬁve positive clones were randomly selected for sequencing, which was carried out in
the Shanghai Sangon Sequencing Center (Shanghai,
China). After BLAST analysis against the GenBank database, the sequences that were related to the myxobacteria
were sequenced from the other direction to obtain the
sequence of the whole segment. The sequence data have
been submitted to GenBank with Accession Nos.
DQ646254 to DQ646330.
2.3. Phylogenetic analysis
For phylogenetic analyses, the 16S rRNA gene
sequences of all myxobacteria available in GenBank were
extracted. After a complete alignment using clustalX (version 1.83; Thompson et al., 1997), corresponding parts of
16S rRNA gene sequences from cultured and uncultured
myxobacteria were used for inferring phylogenetic relation-

547

ships. Phylogenetic trees were inferred using the interior
branch test of the Neighbor-Joining method in MEGA
(version 3.1; Kumar et al., 2004). Phylogenetic relationships were also conﬁrmed by the likelihood and parsimony
programs in the same software package. The bootstrapping
supports for the trees were calculated from a sample of
1000 replicates. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the d-protoebacterium, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (GenBank Accession No. M34113), was used as an outgroup to root the
tree.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phylogenetic diversity of uncultured Sorangineae 16S
rRNA gene sequences
In situ colony hybridization was performed on more
than 1000 clones of the Sorangineae-enriched 16S rRNA
gene library. Approximately 20% of the samples produced
a signal, from which 85 clones were randomly chosen for
sequencing. Among the sequenced clones, six fragments
had no relationship to myxobacteria and were not studied
further. The other 79 sequences (all were unique except for
two, each of which occurred twice) showed 76.4–99.1%
homology with known cultured myxobacteria. Seventyfour of the 77 unique myxobacteria-related clones belonged
to the suborder Sorangineae (Fig. 1). The uncultured
Sorangineae sequences in the campus garden soil exhibited
a similar diversity to that of the uncultured Cystobacterineae, described previously (Wu et al., 2005). Interestingly,
and despite some morphological diversity, sequences of
all cultured Sorangineae were limited to a clade that
included only 16 of the 74 Sorangineae-related sequences
from soil. The 58 other soil-derived sequences were noticeably more diverse. Based on the phylogeny of the 74 unique
Sorangineae sequences, we suggest that this particular soil
habitat contained at least ﬁve major clades of the suborder
Sorangineae, having 90% or less sequence similarity with
one another (i.e., at the depth of separate families). Group
I contained 33 uncultured sequences (accounting for 44.6%
of the total 74 sequences) in two diﬀerent branches, one of
which included all of the reported cultured Sorangineae
strains, i.e. Chondromyces spp., Polyangium spp., Sorangium spp. and Byssophaga spp. (Fig. 1). Among the 33
uncultured sequences, ﬁve clones (9-96, 13-17, 14-33, 208, 20-2) shared >96% similarity with the genus Sorangium,
four clones (9-15, 13-73, 16-60, 21-42) were Polyangiumrelated, seven clones (9-66, 10-37, 13-5, 13-27, 14-7,
15-11, 21-33) were Byssophage-related, and the others were
of unknown subgroups. There was no clone that was aﬃliated with the genus Chondromyces, suggesting that members of this genus were probably not present in the
campus garden soil. This was consistent with the observation that Chondromyces strains are normally found on
the bark of trees (Reichenbach and Dworkin, 1992; Dawid,
2000; Li et al., 2000). The other four groups in the suborder
Sorangineae were comprised exclusively of uncultured

sequences. Group II was composed of 21 clones (28.4% of
the total 74 sequences) with sequence similarity values of 89
to 98%. This group was more closely related to Group I
than the other groups. Groups III and IV were composed
of 4 and 13 clones, respectively (5.4% and 17.6%), and
the three clones in Group V represented 4.1% of the total
74 sequences derived from soil. This last group was distantly related (less than 85% sequence similarity) to Group
I and may represent a newly discovered suborder. The
number of cloned sequences aﬃliated with each group in
Groups II–V was inversely proportional to the evolutionary distance between any one of them and Group I, which
may reﬂect the fact that the Sorangineae speciﬁc primer
(W4) and probe (W5) were designed from the available
sequenced data of the cultured Sorangineae strains, which
were, after all, only present in Group I.
3.2. Molecular taxonomy of cultured and uncultured
myxobacteria
An earlier phylogenetic analysis of 12 representative
myxobacteria strains revealed three distinct clades: Myxococcus, Chondromyces, and Nannocystis (Shimkets and
Woese, 1992). A later study using more myxobacterial
strains also supported this conclusion (Spröer et al.,
1999). After that time, many myxobacteria strains with halophilic or slightly halophilic (Iizuka et al., 1998, 2003a,b;
Fudou et al., 2002), halotolerant (Li et al., 2002; Zhang
et al., 2002a,b), psychrophilic (Dawid, 2000), and anaerobic (Sanford et al., 2002) characteristics have been discovered. Hundreds of 16S rRNA gene sequences of cultured
myxobacteria are now available in GenBank, which
enables detailed phylogenetic analyses of the myxobacteria.
Fig. 2a is a comprehensive phylogenetic tree inferred by
using all the available cultured and uncultured myxobacteria 16S rRNA gene sequences. Almost all cultured myxobacteria, including the common and more unusual, were
found to members of one of the three clades, which are
now known as the three myxobacterial suborders, Cystobacterineae, Sorangineae and Nannocystineae (Reichenbach, 2004). NUST 6 and NU-2, the only two strains not
included in the three suborders, were described as salt-tolerant myxobacterial isolates, but no further information is
available (Zhang et al., 2002a,b).
The most signiﬁcant characteristic of the tree in Fig. 2a
is that the cultured myxobacteria represent only a small
portion of the group’s diversity with respect to 16S rRNA
gene sequences. Despite this diversity, most of the myxobacterial genera, which were originally classiﬁed by their
fruiting body morphology, constituted monophyletic
clades in this molecular systematic analysis. Within-genus
sequence similarity values were generally higher than 98%.
The expansion of the tree in Fig. 2b illustrates the phylogenetic relationships of members of the genus Myxococcus. The study by Stackebrandt and Päuker (2005) of 33
strains of Corallococcus coralloides isolated from 14 countries and ﬁve continents supported that the strains with this

549

type of fruiting body structure also had highly similar 16S
rRNA gene sequences. Thus our study, and that of Stackebrandt and Päuker (2005), suggest that shape and structure
of the fruiting body is a good taxonomic character,
although there are some exceptions. For example, the morphologically distinct genus Melittangium appears to be
polyphyletic in that the 16S rRNA gene sequences of its
diﬀerent members are 99% or more similar to that of either
Corallococcus or Cystobacter, each of which is also polyphyletic in Fig. 2. Although the suborder Nannocystineae
was not explored, a few uncultured Nannocystineae
sequences discovered during our survey of the diversity of
Cystobacterineae and Sorangineae were also characterized
in this study.
Comparing the phylogenies of the cultured and uncultured myxobacteria, we can see that there are many uncultured myxobacteria in nature, which are often signiﬁcantly
distinct from the cultured myxobacteria in their 16S rRNA
gene sequences. Even in the Mx-Fruiting group, the Myxococcus-related sequences derived from soil were not only
distributed in the cultured Myxococcus branches, but also
formed separate uncultured branches (Fig. 2b).
Based on the tree topologies of the cultured and uncultured myxobacteria, we suggest that the sequences recovered directly from soil by using a cultivation-independent
approach cultured may represent myxobacteria which are
incapable of forming fruiting bodies. There are several lines
of evidence which led us to this hypothesis:
1. Since the ﬁrst report by Thaxter (1892), myxobacteria
have been isolated from many diﬀerent samples and
places by many diﬀerent research groups. The isolation
techniques have been modiﬁed many times, but all
involved the collection and/or growth promotion of
fruiting bodies. Most recently obtained new isolates
have been shown to be members of previously described
genera, not new and divergent taxa. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that the morphology-based isolation
techniques have allowed the discovery of most types of
the fruiting myxobacteria. That is to say the myxobacteria that have been isolated to date represent most of the
fruiting myxobacteria which exist in nature, and these
have been used in the construction of the present myxobacterial taxonomy. By carefully comparing the 16S
rRNA gene sequences of the uncultured and cultured
myxobacteria, we can see that most of the sequences
obtained directly from soil were not similar to those
from cultivated taxa (Fig. 1; Wu et al., 2005). The uncultured myxobacteria may represent groups of myxobacteria that are genetically unable to form fruiting bodies.
Alternatively, these myxobacteria might have been previously overlooked because their growth requirements
were not met by the laboratory cultivation methods. In
fact, we examined the soil sample (about 0.5 g) carefully
under a dissecting microscope to establish if myxobacterial fruiting bodies existed, but found no visible
fruiting bodies. However, we found many uncultured

myxobacterial sequences and seven cultured myxobacterial strains in the soil sample. According to Dawid’s
studies on the isolation of myxobacteria from 1398 soil
samples from 64 countries or states in all continents,
one to ten fruiting myxobacterial species can be found
in a soil sample (Dawid, 2000). Reichenbach’s experiences in the recent decades also indicate that 0.5–1 g of
the richest myxobacterial biota may yield 5–10 myxobacterial species, deﬁned by their morphological characteristics (Reichenbach, 1993). Taken together with
results of the current study, it appears that some myxobacteria survive in nature without forming fruiting bodies.
2. Cultured myxobacteria are able to produce fruiting
bodies with a variety of morphological features. Phylogenetic analysis of cultured myxobacteria indicates that
the taxa described in part using fruiting body morphology are mostly monophyletic. Morphogenesis of a fruiting body is a complicated developmental process which
is genetically regulated and controlled. A small change
in the morphogenesis-related genes may result in deﬁciencies in fruiting body formation (Guo et al., 1996;
Lu et al., 2005), which then renders the myxobacteria
undetectable with classical isolation techniques. They
may, however, still survive in nature, together with their
fruiting ancestors, and thus form the basis for our
sequences of uncultured myxobacteria. The uncultured
myxobacteria that have high sequence similarity to the
cultured, fruiting myxobacteria may be those cells that
are deﬁcient in the formation of fruiting bodies; whereas
the uncultured myxobacteria that are distinctly diﬀerent
from the cultured fruiting myxobacteria and located in
unique phylogenetic linaeges may be those cells that
are truly the non-fruiting myxobacteria. The uncultured
myxobacteria may be truly uncultivable, or the optimum
culture conditions have not yet been established. As for
the taxonomy of myxobacteria, the isolated fruiting
myxobacteria represent only a small fraction of the
diversity of this phylogenetic group. To isolate the
uncultured but cultivable myxobacteria will require the
development of new morphogenesis-independent isolation techniques.
3. Myxobacteria are phylogenetically placed in the d-division of the proteobacteria. Compared with the other
members of the this division, myxobacteria show complicated social behavior, at least among those species
that have been isolated and cultured. However, sociality
is not a consistent characteristic. The sociality of Myxococcus xanthus, and particularly the ability to form fruiting bodies can rapidly degrade under asocial growth
conditions (Velicer et al., 1998). Velicer et al. (2002) suggested that there is a direct trade-oﬀ between competitive
ﬁtness in one particular environment and the maintenance of a social trait. The phylogenetic analysis of the
uncultured soil myxobacteria 16S rRNA gene sequences
described in this paper not only supports the suggestions
of Velicer et al. (1998, 2002), but also may indicate that
the myxobacteria include non-fruiting types.

551

Our studies of uncultured myxobacteria in soil greatly
expand the phylogenetic breadth of this group. The
appearance of the fruiting ability in myxobacteria is relatively recently derived trait that is found only in the
myxobacteria. Whether fruiting body formation is an
ancestral trait for the group that, along with gliding
motility, deﬁnes the myxobacteria, or whether it has
evolved independently in diﬀerent clades is an interesting
question that the current study has not resolved. The isolation and culture of the non-fruiting types myxobacteria
would not only oﬀer the opportunity to conﬁrm our
hypothesis, but it would lead to a better understand of
myxobacteria and their evolution.

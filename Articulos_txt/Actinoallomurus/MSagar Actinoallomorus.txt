Mannitol Soya Flour (MS or SFM) agar
Summary. This medium is used to make a number of Streptomyces species
sporulate. Some commonly used strains, including S. scabies and S. venezuelae do
not sporulate on MS agar.
In a 250 mL conical flask mix:
2g Agar
2g Mannitol
2g Soya flour (Holland and Barrett)
10 mM CaCl2
100 mL Deionised water
Seal flask with a foam bung and wrap in aluminium foil. Autoclave once and store at
room temperature. To melt the agar, microwave with regular mixing and do not leave
unattended. Alternatively place in a steamer to melt.
Each flask makes 3-4 plates.
*For liquid growth leave out the agar.

ABSTRACT: Four metabolites, designated paramagnetoquinone A, B, C, and D (1−4), were isolated from three strains
belonging to the actinomycete genus Actinoallomurus.
Compounds 1 and 2 showed potent antibacterial activity
with MIC values lower than 0.015 μg/mL against Grampositive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains. Since
compounds 1 and 2 were NMR-silent due to the presence of
an oxygen radical, structure elucidation was achieved through a
combination of derivatizations, oxidations, and analysis of 13Clabeled compounds. The paramagnetoquinones share the same
carbon scaﬀold as tetracenomycin but carry two quinones and
a ﬁve-membered lactone fused to the aromatic system.
Compounds 2 and 1 are identical except for an unprecedented
replacement of a methoxy in 2 by a methylamino group in 1. Related compounds devoid of methyl group(s) and of antibacterial
activity were isolated from a diﬀerent Actinoallomurus strain. The likely pmq biosynthetic gene cluster was identiﬁed from strain
ID145113. While the cluster encodes many of the expected enzymes involved in the formation of aromatic polyketides, it also
encodes a dedicated ketoacid dehydrogenase complex and an unusual acyl carrier protein transacylase, suggesting that an unusual
starter unit might prime the polyketide synthase.

T

he widespread use of antibacterial agents has led to the
selection of resistant pathogens, which represents a
serious threat to human well-being and health.1 This
phenomenon is proceeding at a faster pace than our ability to
develop safe and eﬀective antibiotics, due to the diﬃculty of
identifying new chemical scaﬀolds as eﬀective starting points for
novel therapeutics. This latter challenge has been exacerbated
by a decreased attention to microbial secondary metabolites,
which cover a broad chemical space and have been selected
through millions of years of evolution.2 However, the past
successes at identifying bioactive molecules from microbial
sources make it necessary to devise smart screens in order to
identify new metabolites in a time- and resource-eﬀective
endeavor.3 Screening underexplored taxa of microorganisms is a
promising approach, since phylogenetic distance from highly
explored microbial strains is expected to lead to novel
chemistry.
In this respect, we have been focusing on strains belonging to
the genus Actinoallomurus,4−7 a member of the Thermomonosporales suborder of Actinobacteria that was formally described
in 2009.8 The presence of about 1000 such strains in the
Naicons collection provides a reasonable number to assess the
potential of this genus to yield novel chemistry and, possibly,
interesting bioactivities.3 As part of this eﬀort, we describe
herein the paramagnetoquinones 1 and 2 with potent
antibacterial activity, together with related metabolites.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Discovery of Paramagnetoquinones. From screening of
about 200 Actinoallomurus strains, strains ID145113, -145206,
and -145754 were identiﬁed as producers of related complexes
with potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria as well as
against a tolC mutant of Escherichia coli. The strains were
isolated from soil samples collected in Corsica (France) and
Campania and Emilia Romagna (Italy). On the basis of their
16S rRNA gene sequences, the strains belong to three distinct,
previously reported Actinoallomurus phylotypes.4,8
The active compounds were recovered by precipitation from
a concentrated and acidiﬁed cleared broth of an ID145113
culture. Washing the resulting pellet with acidiﬁed water and
drying the residue aﬀorded a black powder that was practically
insoluble in water, slightly soluble in organic solvents through
the addition of a few drops of HCl or triﬂuoroacetic acid
(yielding a yellow solution), soluble in DMSO, and highly
soluble in alkaline aqueous solutions (resulting in a dark purple
solution). HPLC analysis showed two major peaks with
retention times of 4.1 and 4.2 min (Figure 1, blue trace) in a
4:6 ratio. The UV−vis spectra of 1 and 2 showed absorption
maxima at 245, 280, and 455 nm and at 254, 275, and 455 nm,
respectively. Both molecules exhibited a characteristic bathoReceived: July 13, 2016

kinobscurinone and stealthins,11 which required acetylation or
methylation of the phenolic oxygens.
Acid-catalyzed acetylation was thus performed on the 1/2
mixture, leading to the formation of a mixture of compounds
whose m/z ratios were consistent with 1/2 carrying multiple
acetyls and containing two additional hydrogens, suggesting
reduction of a quinone moiety. Speciﬁcally, 1 and 2
incorporated up to four and three acetyls, respectively, with
the most abundant molecule corresponding to the tri- and
diacetyl derivatives of 1 and 2, respectively. The acetylation
mixtures were resolved by preparative TLC, and the puriﬁed
compounds aﬀorded sharp NMR signals (Supplementary
Figure S1). Selected data are reported in Table 1, where Ac-2
corresponds to diacetyl-reduced-2 and Ac-1 corresponds to
triacetyl-reduced-1. In addition to the signals belonging to the
introduced acetyls, whose positions were not investigated, the
1
H NMR spectrum of Ac-2 showed one phenolic proton (14.7
ppm), three aromatic singlets (8.26, 7.85, and 7.67 ppm), one
methylene (5.85 ppm), and two methoxy signals (4.11 and 3.98
ppm). Further 2D experiments (Figures S2−S4, Supporting
Information) highlighted a NOESY correlation between the
aromatic CH at 7.85 ppm and the methoxy group at 4.11. The
HMBC correlations between the methyl groups at 3.98 and
4.11 ppm and the carbons at 147.2 and 158.4 ppm, respectively,
revealed an aromatic nature for these methoxy groups.
Moreover, a carboxyl signal was detected (167.4 ppm)
correlating in the HMBC with the methylene at δH 5.85.
This, in turn, showed a long-range TOCSY correlation with the
aromatic CH at δH 7.67. HMBC data also showed the presence
of two unreduced quinone signals (δC 181 and 180.6).
NMR spectra of Ac-1 (Figures S5 and S6, Supporting
Information) showed a similar pattern (see Table 1) except for
the presence of a single methoxy (4.23 ppm) and of an
additional methyl (3.25 ppm) whose δC at 36.1 is consistent
with an aromatic methylamino group. Compounds 1 and 2
showed diﬀerent stability in alkali. In particular, while 1 was
stable even at 60 °C for at least 168 h in 0.01 M NaOH, in this
solvent 2 readily converted at room temperature into a more
hydrophilic compound (tR 3.9 min and m/z 407 [M + H]+).
The 14 amu diﬀerence suggested that the O-methyl group of 2
was lost under these conditions. An instability of a methoxy in
ring E is expected given the negative mesomeric eﬀect brought
about by the two quinone oxygens present in the adjacent ring
D, which results in a better leaving group in comparison with a
methylamino group.12−14 Altogether, the diﬀerent stabilities in
alkali, the HR-MS data, and the NMR spectra suggested that
the diﬀerence between 1 and 2 consists in the substitution of a
methylamino with a methoxy.
However, the paucity of protons together with the
abundance of nonprotonated carbons prevented complete
structure elucidation based on the above data. Thus, we
resorted to oxidative cleavage of the quinone moiety(ies)
performed on native and 13C-enriched 1 and 2, as detailed
below.
In order to break the quinone system and thus eliminate the
radical behavior,15,16 the 1/2 mixture was treated with 30%
H2O2 in water (Scheme 1). Within 1 h at room temperature,
the starting dark purple solution turned yellow with the
formation of a single, more hydrophilic molecule (compound
5) with an m/z of 399 [M + H]+ and UV absorptions at 230,
280, and 420 nm (Figure S7, Supporting Information). This
result indicated that the oxidation had removed the portion
responsible for the diﬀerence between 1 and 2. As expected,

chromic shift from 455 nm to 550 nm when the pH was raised
above 7.0. HR-MS analysis established their chemical formula
as C22H14NO8 for 1 and C22H13O9 for 2.
Structure Elucidation. The 1/2 mixture showed the total
absence of NMR signals, suggesting the presence of a free
radical as previously reported for the so-called NMR-silent
compounds.9 In these molecules, the presence of an extended
aromatic system containing quinone moieties can lead to severe
line-broadening of the NMR signals due to rapid interconversion of the numerous tautomeric forms. An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of the 1/2 mixture gave
an intense signal with g = 2.0047 (data not shown), close to the
value reported for fredericamycin A,10 kinobscurinone, and
stealthin C11 and thus consistent with the presence of an
oxygen radical. The addition of triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA)
traces to the NMR sample can sometimes slow down tautomer
interconversion and lead to sharp signals, as seen for
fredericamycin A.10 However, this approach was ineﬀective in
our case, so we resorted to the procedure employed for

Scheme 1. Oxidative Cleavage of Paramagnetoquinones

puriﬁed 5 was no longer paramagnetic and clear 1H NMR
signals were observed (Table 2; Figure S8, Supporting
Information): one broad phenolic signal (12.48 ppm), two
aromatic protons at 8.14 and 7.81 ppm, one methylene signal at
5.73 ppm, and one methoxy group at 4.18 ppm. Overall, the
MS data, the absence of one aromatic proton and of one
methoxy group in 2 (or one methylamino in 1), are in
agreement with a terminal quinone moiety oxidatively cleaved
and replaced by two carboxylic acids as reported in the
literature.15,16
Suﬃcient incorporation into paramagnetoquinones of 13Clabeled precursor(s) took some media design eﬀorts, since
attempts failed in a minimal medium suitable for growth of and
paramagnetoquinone production by strain ID145113 (see
Experimental Section). We thus resorted to remove and/or
replace individual components from the complex AF-A
production medium in order to render it closer to a chemically
deﬁned medium. Replacing soy ﬂour with glutamine and

reducing the yeast extract concentration to 0.5% (resulting in
AF-N medium) led to satisfactory growth and paramagnetoquinone production of about 400 μg/mL after 8 days of
cultivation.
Strain ID145113 was thus cultivated in 200 mL of AF-N
medium containing 13C-[U]-glucose. LC-MS analysis indicated
that paramagnetoquinones were about 80% enriched in 13C.
Puriﬁcation as described above led to 45 mg of the 1/2 mixture,
which was then treated with H2O2 to obtain 13C-labeled 5.
NMR analysis (HSQC, HMBC, together with 13 C,
ADEQUATE, and INADEQUATE; Figures S9−S11, Supporting Information) of 13C-5 allowed detection of all nonprotonated carbons. Three carbonyl signals at 166.7, 166.5, and
165.5 conﬁrmed the presence of the two oxidation-generated
carboxylic acids, together with the carbonyl moiety that showed
HMBC correlation with the CH2 group, as seen with the
acetylated derivatives. Two signals, at 187.4 and 181 ppm,
evidenced the presence of an intact quinone not aﬀected by

against Clostridium dif ficile (a single strain tested). No activity
(MIC > 16 μg/mL) of 1 and 2 was observed against the other
tested Gram-negative strains (Table 3) or against Candida spp.
Compound 5 was devoid of detectable activity against the
strains from Table 3.
Related Metabolites from Other Actinoallomurus
Strains. Compounds indistinguishable from 1 and 2 were
also found in the fermentation broth of strain ID145754 (data
not shown), as well as minor congeners in the fermentation
broth of strain ID145206, which produced 3, with m/z 393 [M
+ H]+, as the main compound. As mentioned above, the three
Actinoallomurus strains belong to three distinct phylotypes. The
structure of 3, which was also NMR silent, was elucidated
following the same puriﬁcation and derivatization procedure
applied to 1 and 2. In this case, acetylation resulted in the
formation of a tetra-acetyl-reduced derivative as the main
product, with up to ﬁve added acetyls observed in the reaction
mixture. 1H and 2D NMR experiments of the puriﬁed major
acetylated compound (Figures S12 and S13, Supporting
Information) evidenced the presence of one phenol (14.86
ppm), three aromatic protons (8.35, 8.14, and 7.34 ppm), and a
CH2 (5.81 ppm), with the absence of methyl groups, apart
from the acetyl-associated methyls. Acetylated 3 showed a longrange TOCSY correlation between the CH2 and one of the
aromatic protons (δH 8.14, δC 122.1). Selected data are listed in
Table 1. H2O2 oxidation at room temperature or at 60 °C
converted 3 into more hydrophilic products with m/z 385 [M
+ H]+ or m/z 239 [M + H]+, respectively, consistent with
compounds 8 and 9 in Scheme 1. Thus, the main metabolite
from strain ID145206 corresponds to 2 lacking the two Omethyls in the B and E rings. As expected, 3 was stable in
alkaline conditions. Surprisingly, 3 was virtually devoid of
activity against all tested strains, except for streptococci, for
which the observed MICs were 3 orders of magnitude higher
than those of the 1/2 mixture (see Table 3). Thus, the methyl
groups present in 1/2 are important for antibacterial activity. It
should be noted that strain ID145206 also produced a lesser
amount of the related compound 4, with m/z 406 [M + H]+, a
similar UV−vis spectrum to 1, and which was stable in alkaline

oxidation and presumably internal to the remaining aromatic
system. The connectivity of the carbon atoms of the central
core was assigned by INADEQUATE and 1,1-ADEQUATE
experiments (Figure 2). Substitutions at positions 3 and 11

(bold) and 1,1-ADEQUATE (arrows) correlations.

were thus clearly assigned to the methoxy and hydroxy groups,
respectively, with the lactone ring conﬁrmed to be fused to the
B ring at positions 2−13.
Subjecting 5 to stronger oxidation conditions (30% H2O2 at
60 °C for 14 h, Scheme 1) led to the formation of a more
hydrophilic compound (tR 2.1 min; m/z of 253 [M + H]+; UV
maxima at 220, 260, and 304 nm; Figure S7, Supporting
Information), consistent with cleavage of the internal quinone
moiety of 1 and 2 and formation of the compound shown in
Scheme 1.
Antibacterial Activities. The antibacterial activities of the
mixture 1/2 are reported in Table 3. The mixture showed MIC
values in the range 0.03−0.25 μg/mL against Enterococcus and
Staphylococcus spp., with good activity also against all antibioticresistant strains tested. Against Streptococcus spp. the MICs
were lower than 0.015 μg/mL. Activity was also seen against
one fast-growing mycobacterium, the E. coli ΔtolC strain, and
one Moraxella catarrhalis strain (MICs of 0.5, 1, and 0.03 μg/
mL, respectively). The mixture 1/2 was active against some
anaerobic bacteria (Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacteroides fragilis,
and Propionibacterium acnes; MICs of 0.5−1 μg/mL) but not

metabolites in cultures of strain ID145113. By extracting the
cleared broth with ethyl acetate, then back-extracting the
organic phase with 0.05 M NaOH, about 2 mg of the purple
compound 7 was isolated. LC-MS analysis showed a peak at tR
3.8 min with an m/z of 387 [M + H]+ (Figure 1, black
chromatogram). After dissolution in CD3OD, NMR analysis
showed sharp and clear signals, indicating that this metabolite
was radical-free. Selected 1H and 13C NMR data are reported in
Table 1. A clear aliphatic spin system evidenced the presence of
a nonaromatic hydroxylated ring, carrying a hydroxymethylene.
Further signals included two aromatic protons (at 7.3 and 6.77
ppm) in meta position (J = 2 Hz) and one aromatic proton
(7.53 ppm) as an isolated singlet. A quinone moiety was
revealed by the presence of an HMBC correlation between the
proton at 7.53 and a carbon at 180.6 ppm. A methoxy group at
3.95 ppm correlated in the HMBC with an aromatic carbon at
166.6 ppm and in the NOESY with the aromatic proton at 6.77
ppm. A NOESY correlation was also visible between the signals
at 7.53 and 2.80 ppm, the latter corresponding to one of the
protons of C4, the methylene of the aliphatic ring directly
connected to the aromatic rings. The two proton in meta
position correlated with a carbon at 110 ppm, consistent with
C10a. Moreover, one of the protons at C14 (at 3.72 ppm)
correlated in the HMBC with a carbon at 133 ppm, which was
the same carbon seen by the aromatic proton at 7.53 ppm,
demonstrating that the aliphatic ring B was linearly fused with
the aromatic ring C. Overall, the combined LC-MS and NMR
data are consistent with the structure of compound 7 as shown:
7 shares the same polyketide backbone as 1 and 2, but the
terminal carboxyl group has been lost. Interestingly, 7 has not
yet undergone aromatization of ring B and, in contrast with 1
and 2, monooxygenation has occurred in the central ring.

conditions. These data are consistent with 4 being identical to
1, containing just one of the methyl groups. Thus, strain
ID145206 is producing a complex sharing the same scaﬀold as
1 and 2 but, under the investigated experimental conditions, is
ineﬃcient at performing methylations.
Overall, paramagnetoquinones share the same polyketide
scaﬀold as tetracenomycins but with key diﬀerences, including
two quinones, in rings C and E, instead of the single quinone in
ring D, a ﬁve-membered lactone ring fused to ring B, and a
paucity of postpolyketide oxidations. A quinone in a methoxycarrying terminal ring is present in several metabolites with
diﬀerent polyketide scaﬀolds (e.g., fredericamycin, polyketomycin, dutomycin, cervymycin, and bikaverin). Five-membered
lactone rings can be found, in linear or angular positions, in
some aromatic polyketides (e.g., austrocorticins, araliolactones,
and allocyclinone). However, this feature was never reported
for a tetracenomycin analogue, which only presented a methyl
group at the 14-corresponding position, with some congeners
carrying a carboxyl group at the 1- corresponding position. The
unique feature of paramagnetoquinones is the existence of two
congeners, produced in equivalent amounts, which diﬀer for
either an N-methyl or O-methyl group in ring E. The presence
of an N-methyl in an equivalent position has been reported for
a naphthoquinone from Streptomyces, but no O-congeners were
detected in that case.17 Despite the similarities to the
tetracenomycin family, paramagnetoquinones show diﬀerent
antimicrobial behavior with MIC values 3 orders of magnitude
lower than tetracenomycins against both staphylococci and
enterococci.18
A Likely Biosynthetic Intermediate. Having established
that paramagnetoquinones share the same carbon scaﬀold with
the tetracenomycin family, we further looked for related

(CDSs) are described in Table 4. When probed against the
MIBiG database, about two-thirds of the CDSs in the cluster
had a higher pairwise similarity to sequences from other type II
PKS clusters. These included the expected minimal PKS
(NAI113_3498-_3500) for the synthesis of the decaketide
precursor, two cyclases (NAI113_3493 and _3501), and one
TcmG-like monooxygenase (NAI113_3508), likely responsible
for introducing the oxygen at C-7.20 Surprisingly, while 1 and 2
each carries just two methyl groups, the pmq cluster encodes
three methyltransferases: NAI113_3502, showing 51% identity
to the elloramycin/tetracenomycin TcmN-type sequences and
likely to be responsible for O-methylation at position 8,21
NAI113_3507, showing 45% identity to the polyketomycin
methyltransferase PokMT2, predicted to be a C-methyltransferase,22 and NAI113_3509, closely related to PbtM4 (53%
identity), involved in thiazole O-methylation in the thiopeptide
GE227023 (see Table 4).

Nonetheless, 7 already carries the hydroxymethylene group,
which results in the ring A in mature 1 and 2. We were unable
to detect a compound corresponding to the amino version of 7
in fermentation broths, suggesting that 2, or a precursor, can be
converted into the amino form 1 only after a quinone moiety
has been installed in ring E.
The Likely pmq Gene Cluster. We were interested in
exploring whether the gene cluster responsible for paramagnetoquinone formation would provide insights into its
unusual structural features, in particular the presence of a
nitrogen or oxygen atom at position 8. From a draft genome
sequence of strain ID 145113,19 we readily identiﬁed a single
gene cluster (designated pmq) encoding the expected PKS II
system ﬂanked by a tRNA-Pro gene on one end. The pmq gene
cluster encompasses a DNA region of about 27 kbp and
consists of at least 10 transcription units (Figure 3). The
predicted roles for the identiﬁed coding DNA sequences

16S rRNA gene sequences were performed as previously described4,24
(deposited in GenBank with accession numbers KX533972,
KX533973, and KX533974 respectively for strains ID145113,
-145206, and -145754).
Metabolite Puriﬁcation. A 2 L culture of strain ID145113 was
harvested and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to separate the
mycelium from the clear broth. The latter (about 1.8 L) was
concentrated under vacuum to about 1 L and brought to pH 3.2 with
7.2 mL of 6 N HCl. The suspension was kept overnight at 4 °C, and
the resulting pellet was collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10
min, washed twice with 0.1 N HCl (5 mL), and dried in a vacuum
oven at 40 °C for 48 h, yielding 595 mg of a black powder containing 1
and 2. HR-MS analysis established their chemical formula as
C22H14NO8 for 1 (420.0714 found, 420.0719 calcd) and C22H13O9
for 2 (421.0557 found, 421.0559 calcd). The same downstream
process was applied to a 200 mL culture of strain ID145113 grown in
13
C-labeled medium, providing 42 mg of 13C-labeled 1/2 mixture. For
3, 56 mg was similarly obtained from a 200 mL culture of strain
ID145206. Compound 7 was puriﬁed from a 1 L culture of strain
ID145113. After centrifugation as above, the supernatant was extracted
twice with 500 mL of ethyl acetate; then the organic phase was
reduced to 200 mL and extracted twice with 100 mL of 0.05 N NaOH.
The aqueous phase was evaporated under reduced pressure, and about
2 mg of 7 was isolated as a purple powder.
Acetylation, Oxidation, and Stability. To a dark brown,
colloidal solution of 1/2 (50 mg) in acetic anhydride (3 mL) was
added pure H2SO4 (10 μL). The mixture was kept at room
temperature with stirring for 10 h. The color slowly turned yellow.
The reaction was quenched with the addition of 4 mL of H2O and
extracted twice with 6 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was
dried. TLC on silica gel (Fluka Analytical) with CH2Cl2/CH3OH
(98:2 v/v) showed at least four spots. These were separated by
preparative TLC on silica gel to aﬀord the most abundant
corresponding to the triacetyl derivative of 1 (3.9 mg) and the
diacetyl derivative of 2 (4.8 mg). NMR analysis of both products was
carried out in CDCl3. The same reaction was conducted on 15 mg of
3, obtaining 2.3 mg of tetraacetyl derivative.
The 1/2 mixture (20 mg) was dissolved in 4 mL of 30% H2O2 and
2 mL of acetonitrile and kept under magnetic stirring for 24 h. After
complete conversion of 1/2 into 5 (tR 3.6 min with m/z of 399 [M +
H]+ and UV absorptions at 230, 280, and 420 nm), the reaction was
quenched with the addition of 400 μL of 1 M sodium metabisulﬁte
and concentrated under vacuum. 5 was puriﬁed using a CombiFlash
RF Teledyne ISCO medium-pressure chromatography system on a 30
g Biotage SNAP Cartridge KP-C18-HS. The column was previously
conditioned at 10% phase B, brought to 25% phase B in 2 min, then
eluted at 30 mL/min for 10 min up to 45% phase B. After elution, the
column was washed with 80% phase B (phase A was water with 0.1%
TFA, and phase B was acetonitrile). Fractions containing 5 were
pooled and dried under reduced pressure, obtaining 6 mg of puriﬁed
compound. The same reaction was conducted on 42 mg of a 70% 13Clabeled 1/2 mixture, obtaining 20 mg of 13C-5. Unlabeled 5 was also
subjected to reaction with 30% H2O2 at 60 °C for 14 h, obtaining 6 (tR
2.4 min, m/z of 253 [M + H]+, UV absorption peaks at 220, 260, and
304 nm). Compound 3 (2 mg) was reacted with 30% H2O2 (room
temperature, 1 h), giving compound 8 (tR 3.0 min, m/z of 385 [M +
H]+), which was then converted into 9 (tR 2.3 min, m/z of 239 [M +
H]+) after treating with H2O2 at 60 °C for 14 h. For NMR
characterization, 5 mg of 5 was dissolved in 450 μL of DMSO-d6/50
μL of TFA.
The 1/2 mixture (1 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of 0.01 M NaOH,
yielding a dark purple solution and monitored by LC-MS over time. At
room temperature, about 50% 2 converted in 24 h into a more
hydrophilic derivative (tR 3.9 min, m/z 407 [M + H]+). At 60 °C, 2
completely converted within 20 min into a 407 m/z compound. Under
both conditions, 1 was stable, as was the 3/4 mixture (tested only at
60 °C).
Paramagnetoquinone A (1): purple powder; UV−vis (0.1% TFA/
acetonitrile, 3:7) λmax (log ε) 245 (5.25), 285 (5.30), 455 (4.79) nm;
NMR silent; EPR data: g = 2.0047; ESI(+)MS m/z 420.1 [M + H]+;

While the pmq cluster does not encode any candidate for
introducing the nitrogen atom at position 8, it does encode
unusual features, namely, the three components of a biotindependent carboxylase (NAI113_3503-_3505) for generating
the malonyl-CoA extender units, a PKS-related acyltransferase
(NAI113_3487), presumably involved in charging the ACP
with a starter/extender unit, and an apparently functional
ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (NAI113_3490-_3492),
presumably responsible for generating an acyl-CoA precursor.
Surprisingly, the acyltransferase NAI113_3487 is more related
to the equivalent domains from type I PKSs from Proteobacteria
than to actinomycete-derived PKSs (Table 4).
Thus, the pmq cluster appears to encode enzymes involved in
the formation of two sets of CoA derivatives, one by
carboxylation of acetylCoA and the other by decarboxylation
of a ketoacid. The presence of an acyl-CoA-generating system
and of an acyltransferase within the pmq cluster are consistent
with the possibility that a special polyketide unit is produced by
the ketoacid dehydrogenase complex and charged onto the
ACP by the acyltransferase NAI13_3487. Since 1 and 2 contain
a hydroxymethyl group at a place equivalent to the polyketide
starter unit in tetracenomycin and since the hydroxymethyl is
already present in the metabolite 7, it is possible that
paramagnetoquinone biosynthesis utilizes a hydroxyacetylCoA as starter unit.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

General Experimental Procedures. LC-MS analysis were
performed with an Agilent 1100 Series liquid chromatograph equipped
with an Ascentis Express Supelco RP18, 2.7 μm, 50 × 4.6 mm, column
eluted at 1 mL/min at 40 °C. Elution was with a 10 min multistep
program that consisted of 5%, 95%, 100%, and 5% phase B at 0, 6, 7,
and 7.2 min, respectively (phases A and B were 0.05% TFA [v/v] in
water and in acetonitrile, respectively) with detection at 220 nm. The
eﬄuent from the column was split 1:1 into a photodiode array
detector and into the ESI interface of a Bruker Esquire 3000 Plus ion
trap mass spectrometer (Bruker). Mass spectrometry analysis was
performed using the following sample inlet conditions: sheath gas
(N2) 50 psi, dry gas 10 L/min, capillary heater 365 °C; sample inlet
voltage settings: positive polarity, capillary voltage −4000 V, end plate
oﬀset −500 V; scan conditions: maximum ion time 200 ms, ion time 5
ms, full microscan 3; segment: duration 10 min, scan events positive
(100−2400 m/z). HR-MS analyses were performed on an Exactive
benchtop mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Spa, Milano,
Italy), equipped with a nanospray ionization/electrospray ionization
ion source by direct infusion of compounds dissolved in DMSO/H2O,
1:9. The EPR spectrum was measured using a Bruker Elexys
spectrometer, equipped with an ER4102ST standard rectangular
cavity. The loose-packed sample was loaded in a cylindric quartz tube
(Covaler, i.d. 3 mm, o.d. 4 mm). The magnetic ﬁeld intensity was
monitored by a teslameter. The EPR spectrum was collected at a
working frequency of 9.4047 GHz (as measured by an HP5340A
frequency counter). 1H and 13C 1D and 2D NMR spectra (COSY,
TOCSY, NOESY, HSQC, HMBC) were measured in CDCl3 or
DMSO-d6 with or without TFA addition at 25 °C using a Bruker AMX
400 MHz spectrometer. Adequate and inadequate experiments were
measured on an Agilent (Varian) VNMRS 500 MHz spectrometer.
Producer Strains and Cultivation Conditions. Actinoallomurus
ID145113, ID145206, and ID145754 were maintained on S1 5.5
plates.4 The strains were grown in shake-ﬂasks containing AF-A
medium (dextrose 10 g/L, soybean meal 4 g/L, yeast extract 1 g/L,
NaCl 0.5 g/L, MES 1.5 g/L, adjusted to pH 5.6 before sterilization)
for 240 h at 30 °C in a rotatory shaker at 200 rpm. For 13C-labeling
experiments, an exponentially growing culture of strain ID145113 in
AF-A medium was inoculated (10%) in AF-N medium (13C-glucose 5
g/L, glutamine 1 g/L, yeast extract 0.5 g/L, NaCl 0.5 g/L, MES 1 g/L,
adjusted to pH 5.6 before sterilization). Ampliﬁcation and analysis of

Bioinformatic Analysis. Identiﬁcation of biosynthetic gene
clusters was performed using the Antismash v3.0.1 tool at the default
conditions.25 BLAST analysis of individual CDSs was performed
against the MIBiG database of known gene clusters.26 The sequence of
the pmq cluster has been deposited with accession number KX533975.
Antimicrobial Assays. Minimal inhibitory concetrations (MICs)
were determined according to CLSI guidelines27 by broth microdilution in sterile 96-well microtiter plates, using Müller Hinton broth
containing 20 mg/L CaCl2 and 10 mg/L MgCl2 for all aerobic bacteria
except for Streptococcus spp., Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Haemophilus inf luenzae, which were grown in Todd Hewitt broth, in
Middlebrook 7H9 broth (with 10% OADC supplement, BD, Becton
Dickinson, USA), and Brain Hearth Infusion (with 0.5% yeast extract),
respectively. Anaerobes were grown in Brucella broth supplemented
with 5 μg/mL hemin and 1 μg/mL vitamin K1, with Oxyrase (Oxyrase
Inc., Mansﬁeld, OH, USA) added (1:25 v/v) when growing
Clostridium spp. All media were from Difco Laboratories. Strains
were inoculated at 5 × 105 cfu/mL. Aerobic bacteria were incubated at
37 °C for 20−24 h, with the exception of Mycobacterium smegmatis
strain, which required a 72 h incubation. Anaerobes were incubated at
37 °C for 48 h in a plastic GasPak EZ incubation container system
with anaerobic conditions (80% N2, 10% CO2, and 10% H2) obtained
with a GasPaK EZ Gas generating sachet (BD, Becton Dickinson,
USA). All strains (with the exception of the ATCC strains and
mc2155) were clinical isolates from the NAICONS strain collection.

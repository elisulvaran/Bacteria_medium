A novel actinobacterium strain, 2614A723T, was isolated from rhizosphere soil of mangrove plant
Acanthus ilicifolius collected at Touyuan, Wenchang, Hainan province, China. A phylogenetic
analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain 2614A723T formed a distinct
phyletic line in the genus Actinoallomurus, the 16S rRNA gene tree sharing similarities of
98.35 %, 98.07 % and 97.86 % with Actinoallomurus spadix NBRC 14099T, Actinoallomurus
purpureus TTN02-30T and Actinoallomurus luridus TT02-15T, respectively. Strain 2614A723T
contained lysine and meso-diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall peptidoglycan and madurose,
galactose and xylose in the whole-cell sugars. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H4)
and MK-9(H6). The major polar phospholipids were phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The predominant fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0. These chemotaxonomic
data confirmed the affiliation of strain 2614A723T to the genus Actinoallomurus. It is apparent
from the combined phenotypic data, biochemical tests and DNA–DNA hybridization values that
strain 2614A723T should be classified in the genus Actinoallomurus as a representative of a
novel species. The name Actinoallomurus acanthiterrae sp. nov. is proposed with strain
2614A723T (5CCTCC AA 2012001T5DSM 45727T) as the type strain.

The genus Actinoallomurus was first established by Tamura
et al.(2009) as a member of the family Thermomonosporaceae. Members of this genus have been found in
different environments, including soils, plants and dung
(Pozzi et al., 2011; Tamura et al., 2009; Indananda et al.,
2011) and have the potential to produce metabolites arising
from different biosynthetic pathways (Pozzi et al., 2011). In
the course of studying actinomycetes from Acanthus ilicifolius rhizosphere soil in different mangroves of China,
strain 2614A723T were isolated on oatmeal agar (Shirling &
Gottlieb, 1966) supplemented with novobiocin (25 mg
ml21), nystatin (30 mg ml21), nalidixic acid (10 mg ml21)
and K2Cr2O7 (20 mg ml21) and incubated at 28 uC for
30 days. The isolate was purified and maintained on
glucose–yeast extract–malt agar medium (ISP medium 2;
The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number for the 16S rRNA gene
sequence of 2614A723T is JQ085862.

of mycelia fragments in glycerol (20 % v/v) at 220 uC
for study and at 280 uC for long-term preservation. Its
taxonomic position was investigated using a polyphasic
approach.
The morphological and physiological characteristics of
strain 2614A723T, Actinoallomurus spadix NBRC 14099T,
Actinoallomurus luridus TT02-15T and Actinoallomurus
purpureus TTN02-30T were tested simultaneously. Growth
and cultural characteristics were examined by using various
agar media (ISP 2–7) (Shirling & Gottlieb, 1966) and yeast
extract–starch agar medium [YS: yeast extract 2 g l21, starch
10 g l21 and agar15 g l21, NITE Biological Resource Center
(NBRC) medium No.1053 ] used for Actinoallomurus
purpureus TTN02-30T. All the test media had a final pH of
5.8–6.0. Cultures were incubated at 28 uC and observations
were recorded after 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Cell morphology
was observed by scanning electron microscopy (TM3000,
Hitachi) after incubation on ISP medium 3 for 30 days at

28 uC. Specimens for electron microscopy were fixed in
2.5 % glutaraldehyde, dehydrated, critical-point dried and
coated with gold as described by Lee & Jeong (2006), before
observation. Strain 2614A723T grew well on ISP 2, ISP 3, ISP
6, ISP 7 and YS medium. Moderate growth was observed on
ISP 4 and ISP 5. Poor aerial mycelium was present on ISP
medium 2 and YS medium, good aerial mycelium was only
present on ISP medium 3. Soluble pigment was produced on
ISP 7 agar (Table S1 available in IJSEM online). Strain
2614A723T formed short spiral chains of oval and smoothsurfaced spores (Fig. 1), similar to other species of this genus
that form oval to rod-shaped and irregular-sized spores at
maturity.
The ability of the strain to grow at a range of temperatures
(4, 18, 28, 34, 37, 42 and 50 uC) was tested on modified
Bennett’s agar (Jones, 1949). pH range (pH 4.0–9.0 at intervals of half a pH unit) were determined by using doubleconcentration YS liquid medium supplemented with an
equal pH and amount of phosphate buffer solution.
Tolerance of NaCl [0–6 %(w/v), at intervals of 0.5 %] for
growth were estimated by using YS liquid medium shaken at
200 r.p.m., 28 uC for 7–14 days. Utilization of sole carbon
and nitrogen sources was examined on ISP medium 9
(Shirling & Gottlieb, 1966) including each ether-sterilized
compound at a final concentration of 1 % (w/v) for sugars
or 0.5 % (w/v) for amino acids. Gelatin liquefaction, starch
hydrolysis and reaction on milk were tested as described
by Gordon et al. (1974) and Goodfellow (1971). Catalase
activity was detected by the production of bubbles after the
addition of a drop of 3 % (v/v) H2O2. Oxidase activity was
determined by the oxidation of tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. Nitrate reductase and hydrolysis of aesculin were
examined as described by MacFaddin (1980). Hydrolysis of
carboxymethyl-cellulose was examined on modified Bennett’s
agar (Jones, 1949) as described by Teather & Wood (1982):
after an appropriate incubation period (one or two weeks) at
28 uC, the Bennett’s agar medium was flooded with an

aqueous solution of Congo red (1 mg ml21 for media
containing carboxymethyl cellulose or carboxymethyl pachyman; 0.2 mg ml21 for media containing oat b-D-glucan)
for 15 min. The Congo red solution was then poured off,
and plates were further treated by flooding with 1 M NaCl
for 15 min. The visualized zones of hydrolysis could be
stabilized for at least 2 weeks by flooding the agar with 1 M
HCl, which changes the dye colour to blue and inhibits
further enzyme activity. Other physiological and biochemical tests were performed according to the established
methods of Williams et al. (1983) and Kämpfer et al. (1991).
The physiological properties of the novel strain are summarized and compared with those of related species of the
genus Actinoallomurus in detail in Table 1.
Biomass for chemical and molecular systematic studies was
obtained from culture in liquid YS medium on a rotary
shaker at 220 r.p.m., 34 uC for 5–7 days at exponential growth
phase. Amino acids and sugars in whole-cell hydrolysates
were analysed according to the procedure of Lechevalier &
Lechevalier (1980) by TLC. The acyl type of the cell wall was
analysed according to the method of Uchida & Aida (1984).
Phospholipids were extracted, examined by two-dimensional
TLC and identified using previously described procedures
(Minnikin et al., 1984; Collins & Jones, 1980). Menaquinones were extracted according to the protocol of Collins
et al. (1977) and determined by HPLC (Tamaoka et al.,
1983). Fatty acids were extracted by the method of Sasser
(1990) and the composition was determined by GC–MS
performed on a GC instrument (7890A; Agilent) coupled
with a mass selective detector (MS-5975C; Agilent) and an
autosampler injector (7693-A; Agilent). A capillary column
HP-5MS (5 % phenylmethylsiloxane) with dimensions of
30 m6250 mm60.25 mm film thickness (Agilent 19091N133) was used for the separation of fatty acid methyl esters.
The initial temperature of 100 uC was maintained for 5 min,
raised to 240 uC at the rate of 10 uC min21. Injected volume
of sample was 1 ml and helium was used as a carrier gas at a
flow rate of 0.8 ml min without split. The injector and
detector temperatures were 230 uC and 250 uC, respectively.
The MS was operated in the electron multiplier voltage
(EMV) mode at 988 V in the scan range of 50–400 m/z.
The whole-cell hydrolysates of strain 2614A723T contained
meso-diaminopimelic acid, alanine, lysine, glycine and glutamic acid. Madurose, xylose and galactose were detected as
the whole-cell sugars. The phospholipids comprised phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol (Fig. S1.). The acyl type of the muramic acid is
N-acetyl. Strain 2614A723T contained menaquinones MK-9
(H4) (67.41 %), MK-9 (H6) (27.66 %) as major menaquinones and a small amount of MK-9 (H2) (4.91 %) (Table 1).
The major fatty acids present in strain 2614A723T were isoC16 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0 (Table S2).

and Cantor (1969). The resultant unrooted tree topologies
were evaluated by bootstrap analyses (Felsenstein 1985)
based on 1000 resamplings of the neighbour-joining dataset.
All positions containing gaps and missing data were
eliminated from the dataset (complete deletion option).
Strain 2614A723T shared its highest 16S rRNA gene
sequence similarity with the type strain of A. spadix NBRC
14099T, 98.35 %, a value which corresponded to 21 nucleotide differences and three nucleotide gaps out of 1451
locations. The corresponding 16S rRNA similarities with the
type strains of A. purpureus TTN02-30T and A. luridus
TT02-15T were 98.07 % and 97.86 %, respectively, values
equivalent to 27 nucleotide differences and one nucleotide
gap and 29 nucleotide differences and two nucleotide gaps,
respectively. It was evident from the dendrogram shown in
Fig. 2 that the new isolate formed a distinct branch with
A. spadix NBRC 14099T, A. purpureus TTN02-30T and A.
luridus TT02-15T. This was also supported in the maximumparsimony tree.
Chromosomal DNA was extracted as described by
Pospiech & Neumann (1995). The G+C content of the
genomic DNA was determined by using the HPLC method
(Mesbah et al., 1989). DNA–DNA hybridizations between
strain 2614A723T and A. spadix NBRC 14099T, A. purpureus
TTN02-30T and A. luridus TT02-15T were performed to
determine whether the isolate represented a novel species.
DNA–DNA relatedness values were determined using a
modified nylon membrane hybridization method described
previously by Sui et al. (2011).
The DNA–DNA relatedness values between strain 2614A723T
and the type strains of A. spadix NBRC 14099T, A. purpureus
TTN02-30T and A. luridus TT02-15T averaged out at
17.15±0.36 %, 12.75±0.71 % and 42.92±0.28 %, respectively, values well below the 70 % cut-off point recommended by Wayne et al. (1987) for the delineation of genomic
species. In addition, the DNA G+C content of strain
2614A723T was 71.3 mol%. This value is within the range
for the genus Actinoallomurus (Tamura et al., 2009).

The isolate could be distinguished from other species of the
genus Actinoallomurus with validly published names using
a combination of phenotypic properties. Physiological and
chemotaxonomic analyses indicated that strain 2614A723T
belonged to the genus Actinoallomurus. The differential
properties of strain 2614A723T from the most closely related
species of the genus Actinoallomurus (Table 1), 16S rRNA
gene sequence and DNA–DNA hybridization analyses
indicated that it represented a novel species. It is evident
from the genotypic and phenotypic data that strain 2614A723T
can be distinguished from other known species of the genus
Actinoallomurus. It is therefore proposed that the strain be
classified in the genus Actinoallomurus as Actinoallomurus
acanthiterrae sp. nov.

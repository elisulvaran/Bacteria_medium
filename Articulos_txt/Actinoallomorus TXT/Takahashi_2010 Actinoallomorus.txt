A novel endophytic actinomycete, strain GMKU 931T, was isolated from the root of a wattle tree,
Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth., collected at Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand.
Strain GMKU 931T produced short spiral chains of smooth-surfaced spores on the aerial
mycelium. Lysine and meso-diaminopimelic acid were present in the cell-wall peptidoglycan.
Whole-cell hydrolysates contained galactose, madurose and mannose. The predominant
menaquinones were MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8). The major fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0 and
iso-C16 : 1. The major phospholipids were phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol. A
phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences suggested that strain GMKU 931T
forms a distinct phyletic line within the recently proposed genus Actinoallomurus. The significant
differences in phenotypic and genotypic data indicate that strain GMKU 931T represents a novel
species of the genus Actinoallomurus, for which the name Actinoallomurus acaciae sp. nov. is
proposed. The type strain is GMKU 931T (5BCC 28622T 5NBRC 104354T 5NRRL
B-24610T).

Endophytic actinomycetes have recently attracted a lot of
attention. Their mutual association with plants may play
important roles in protecting the plant from pathogenic
infection, promoting plant growth or assisting plant
survival during environmental stress (Kunoh, 2002;
Hasegawa et al., 2006). The isolation of novel endophytic
actinomycetes is expected to lead to the identification of
novel bioactive compounds and/or growth-regulating
agents as well as novel actinomycete genera and species.
Thailand is a natural-resource-rich country and there is a
wide range of plant diversity. Therefore, we have
established a programme for the isolation and identification of endophytic actinomycetes from plants, including
those of important agricultural and medicinal species. In
this work, endophytic actinobacteria were isolated from the
wattle tree (Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth.), of
which one is described here.

The genus Actinoallomurus (Tamura et al., 2009) is the most
recently described genus in the family Thermomonosporaceae
(Kroppenstedt & Goodfellow, 1991; Zhang et al., 1998,
2001), which includes Actinocorallia, Actinomadura
(Nonomura & Ohara, 1971), Excellospora, Spirillospora and
Thermomonospora. Members of the genus Actinoallomurus
were found to be phylogenetically related to Actinomadura
spadix, which exhibited low 16S rRNA gene sequence
similarity with other Actinomadura species (Tamura et al.,
2009). Polyphasic investigation also revealed that
Actinomadura spadix could be clearly distinguished at the
genus level from other Actinomadura species and, therefore,
the species was assigned to the genus Actinoallomurus as
Actinoallomurus spadix comb. nov. (Tamura et al., 2009). At
the same time, other isolates from soil and dung samples,
collected from various places in Japan, were chemotaxonomically and phylogenetically characterized and eight more
novel species belonging to the genus Actinoallomurus were
proposed (Tamura et al., 2009). Actinoallomurus spadix was
designated the type species of the genus.
Members of the genus Actinoallomurus contain mesodiaminopimelic acid in the cell wall and madurose as a

characteristic sugar in whole-cell hydrolysates, which is
similar to the closely related genus Actinomadura
(Lechevalier & Lechevalier, 1970; Goodfellow, 1989).
Additionally, the cell-wall peptidoglycan encloses D- and
L-lysine, which is an important characteristic to differentiate Actinoallomurus species from Actinomadura species
(Tamura et al., 2009). The acyl type of the muramic acid is
N-acetyl. The fatty acid profiles include iso-hexadecanoic
acid (iso-C16 : 0) as the major component and the
phospholipid patterns contain phosphatidylinositol mannoside. The main menaquinones are MK-9(H6) and MK9(H8).
Strain GMKU 931T was isolated from a root of Acacia
auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth. collected at Kasetsart
University, Bangkok, Thailand. The root was surface
sterilized with 95 % ethanol and 1 % sodium hypochlorite
before being ground and spread onto starch-casein agar
(Küster & Williams, 1964) supplemented with (ml–1)
100 mg ampicillin, 2.5 U penicillin G and 20 mg ketoconazole. After incubation at 30 uC for 21 days, abundant small,
white colonies were observed. The strain was isolated and
purified on mannitol soya (MS) agar (Hobbs et al., 1989).
The pure culture was maintained as a suspension in 20 %
glycerol at –80 uC and as lyophilized cells for long-term
preservation.
Strain GMKU 931T grew well on International Streptomyces
Project (ISP) medium 2 (Shirling & Gottlieb, 1966) and
MS agar at 30 uC and it started to produce whitish spores
after 14 days. Moderate growth was observed on ISP 3,
oatmeal-nitrate agar (l–1: 3.0 g Quaker white oat, 0.2 g
KNO3, 0.5 g K2HPO4, 0.2 g MgSO4 . 7H2O, 15.0 g agar;
pH 7.0) and 1/10 yeast extract-starch agar, poor growth
was observed on ISP 5 and there was no growth on ISP 4.
No soluble pigment was produced on any of the media
tested. No production of melanin pigment was observed on
ISP 1 or ISP 7. Morphological characteristics were
examined by subculturing the strain on oatmeal-nitrate
agar and observing under a light microscope and a
scanning electron microscope (JSM 5600 LV; JEOL).
Strain GMKU 931T formed short spiral chains of
smooth-surfaced spores (Fig. 1). Growth of strain GMKU
931T was determined over the temperature range 5–50 uC
in a temperature-gradient incubator over 14 days on ISP 2.
Growth was observed at 12–41 uC, with the optimal
temperature for good growth being 28–30 uC. The strain
was able to grow at pH 5.0–8.0, with optimal growth at
pH 6.0–7.0. On ISP 2, the strain was able to tolerate NaCl
up to 3 % (w/v); no growth was observed at 4 % NaCl.
Urease activity was determined by a colour change in urea
broth (Gordon et al., 1974). Hydrolysis of casein and
gelatin was evaluated using the media of Gordon et al.
(1974). Reduction of nitrate was determined using ISP 8 by
the method of the ISP (Shirling & Gottlieb, 1966). Catalase
and oxidase activities were determined with 3 % (v/v)
hydrogen peroxide solution and 1 % tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine solution, respectively. Strain GMKU 931T

showed activity for catalase and urease but not for oxidase.
Degradation of gelatin and casein and reduction of nitrate
were negative.
Genomic DNA of strain GMKU 931T was extracted from
mycelium material scraped from a well-grown culture on
ISP 2 according to the protocol described by Kieser et al.
(2000). The 16S rRNA gene sequence was amplified using
primers described by Tajima et al. (2001). Amplification
was carried out in a thermal cycler (TaKaRa), with an
initial incubation step at 94 uC for 1 min, 30 cycles of
94 uC for 1 min, 50 uC for 1 min and 72 uC for 1–5 min
and a final extension step at 72 uC for 2 min. The PCR
product was purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit
(Qiagen) and was sequenced directly on an ABI model
3130 automatic DNA sequencer using a BigDye
Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems).
An almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain
GMKU 931T (1468 bp) was preliminarily compared with
16S rRNA gene sequences in the GenBank database, which
indicated a close relationship with members of the genus
Actinoallomurus (Tamura et al., 2009). Multiple alignment
of the sequences obtained from strain GMKU 931T and the
type strains of the nine Actinoallomurus species with validly
published names, using Actinomadura madurae NBRC
14623T as an outgroup, was performed using CLUSTAL X
version 2 (Larkin et al., 2007). A phylogenetic tree was
constructed with MEGA version 4.0 (Tamura et al., 2007)
using the neighbour-joining method (Saitou & Nei, 1987)
and the reliability of the tree topology was evaluated by
bootstrap analysis with 1000 resamplings (Felsenstein,
1985). The result of the phylogenetic analysis indicated
that strain GMKU 931T formed a distinct clade within the
genus Actinoallomurus (Fig. 2). The closest phylogenetic

Actinoallomurus fulvus NBRC 103680 , with 16S rRNA gene
sequence similarity values of 99.30, 99.20 and 99.11 %,
respectively.
Strain GMKU 931T was analysed chemically using the
methodology for the genus Actinoallomurus (Tamura et al.,
2009). The biomass was obtained after incubation at 27 uC
for 5 days in ISP 2 broth. Whole-cell amino acids and
sugars were analysed using the method of Hasegawa et al.
(1983) and Becker et al. (1965), respectively. The acyl type
of the cell wall was analysed according to the method of
Uchida & Aida (1984). Phospholipids were extracted and
determined by the method of Minnikin et al. (1984).
Menaquinones were extracted and purified by using the
method of Collins et al. (1977) and isoprene units were
analysed by HPLC using a Jasco 802-SC chromatograph
equipped with a Shiseido CAPCELL PAK C18 column as
described by Tamaoka et al. (1983). Analysis of the fatty
acids was performed according to the procedures for the
Sherlock Microbial Identification System (Microbial ID).
Mycolic acids were analysed by TLC according to the
method of Tomiyasu (1982). The G+C content (mol%) of
DNA, which was isolated according to the method of
Marmur (1961), was determined by HPLC according to the
method of Tamaoka & Komagata (1984). The diagnostic
amino acids of the peptidoglycan layer of strain GMKU
931T were meso-diaminopimelic acid, lysine, alanine and
glutamic acid. The sugars presented in whole-cell hydrolysates were galactose, glucose, madurose, mannose and
ribose. Madurose was the characteristic sugar, indicating
type-B whole-cell sugars (Lechevalier & Lechevalier, 1970).
The N-acyl group of the muramic acid in peptidoglycan
was of the acetyl type. Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol were detected as the major phospholipids. The
major menaquinones were MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8),
while a small amount of MK-9(H4) was also detected.
The predominant fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0 (40.9 %) and
iso-C16 : 1 (16 %). The minor fatty acids were C16 : 0 (4.3 %),
10-methyl C16 : 0 (3.4 %), C17 : 0 (3.8 %), anteiso-C17 : 0
(5 %), 10-methyl C17 : 0 (6.9 %), C18 : 0 (4.6 %) and 10methyl C18 : 0 (tuberculostearic acid; 3.3 %). No mycolic
acids were detected. The G+C content of the DNA of
strain GMKU 931T was 70.6 mol%.

There are a number of phenotypic differences between
strain GMKU 931T and its closest phylogenetic neighbours,
Actinoallomurus caesius NBRC 103678T, Actinoallomurus
amamiensis NBRC 103682T and Actinoallomurus fulvus
NBRC 103680T, including differences in morphological
characteristics, optimal temperature for growth, utilization
of sole carbon sources, degradation abilities and enzymic
activities (Table 1). The significant characteristics that
distinguish strain GMKU 931T from the other three strains
are that strain GMKU 931T does not produce diffusible
pigment on ISP 2, ISP 3 or yeast-starch agar, does not grow
on ISP 4, grows well at 28–30 uC, does not utilize maltose,
raffinose or gelatin, hydrolyses urea and exhibits aglucosidase activity when examined with the API ZYM
enzyme assay.
To examine the finer taxonomic relationships between
strain GMKU 931T and its three closest phylogenetic
neighbours, DNA–DNA hybridization relatedness values
(means of duplicate measurements) were determined
fluorometrically by the method of Ezaki et al. (1989).
The results supported the phenotypic and genotypic data
and confirmed that strain GMKU 931T belongs to a
different species: low DNA–DNA relatedness values were
found between strain GMKU 931T and Actinoallomurus
caesius NBRC 103678T (44 %), Actinoallomurus amamiensis
NBRC 103682T (43 %) and Actinoallomurus fulvus NBRC
103680T (43 %).
On the basis of the data presented in this study, it is evident
that strain GMKU 931T represents a distinct novel genomic
species belonging to the genus Actinoallomurus. Strain
GMKU 931T is readily distinguished from its closest
phylogenetic
neighbours
Actinoallomurus
caesius,
Actinoallomurus amamiensis and Actinoallomurus fulvus
on the basis of distinct phyletic lines, differences in
phenotypic data and low levels of DNA–DNA relatedness.
The name Actinoallomurus acaciae sp. nov. is proposed.

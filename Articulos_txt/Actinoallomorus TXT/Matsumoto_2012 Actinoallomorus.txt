Three strains, K08-0182T, K08-0178 and K08-0195 were isolated from the paste of ground plant
roots collected in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. These strains contained meso-diaminopimelic
acid and lysine as the diamino acids in cell-wall peptidoglycan, and MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8) as
the predominant menaquinones. The G+C contents of the DNA were 72–73 mol%. Taken
together, these characteristics combined with 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses revealed that
the isolated strains belong to the genus Actinoallomurus. DNA–DNA hybridization values showed
that the three strains belonged to a novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus. Therefore strains
K08-0182T, K08-0178 and K08-0195 are proposed as representatives of a novel species,
Actinoallomurus radicium sp. nov. The type strain is K08-0182T (5DSM 45523T 5NBRC
107678T 5JCM 17294T).

Numerous attempts have been made to isolate many
actinomycete strains from various samples for the purpose
of finding new microbial resources in screening for novel
natural products. In many trials we have used plant roots
to isolate rare or novel actinomycete strains, and we reported
the novel genus and species Phytohabitans suffuscus, which
was isolated from an orchid variety (Inahashi et al., 2010),
and Actinoallomurus acaciae (Thamchaipenet et al., 2010)
and Actinoallomurus oryzae (Indananda et al., 2011) that
were isolated from separate plants in Thailand. The genus
Actinoallomurus, the type species of which is Actinoallomurus
spadix, was transferred from the genus Actinomadura based
on a proposal by Tamura et al. (2009). Here we report the
taxonomic characteristics of another novel species in the
genus Actinoallomurus.
Strains K08-0182T and K08-0178, and strain K08-0195 were
isolated from the roots of a Mondo grass and a Chusan Palm
collected in Kanagawa Prefecture in March 2008, respectively. The roots were washed with sterilized water and dried
in a chamber with silica gel for several days. After soaking
the roots in 70 % ethanol for 30 s and then in 1 % sodium
hypochlorite for 30 s, the samples were rinsed in sterilized
water before being ground in extraction solution (0.38 %
K2HPO4, 0.12 % KH2PO4, 0.51 % MgSO4 . H2O, 0.25 %

and plated on cellobiose-asparagine agar (1.0 % cellobiose,
The GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers for the 16S rRNA

pH 7.0). Colonies were picked up after incubation for
6 weeks at 27 uC.
Morphological characteristics of the aerial mycelium were
observed by scanning electron microscopy (JSM-5600,
JEOL) after incubation on ISP medium 4 (Difco) for 1
month at 27 uC and fixation with 4 % osmium tetroxide
vapour. Cultural and physiological characteristics were
observed after incubation for 3 weeks at 27 uC. Cultural
characteristics were examined on ISP medium 2 (Difco),
ISP medium 3 (DAIGO, Nihon Pharmaceutical), ISP
medium 4 and ISP medium 7 (DAIGO). ISP medium 4
was used to examine starch hydrolysis, ISP medium 8 (0.5 %
peptone, 0.3 % beef extract, 0.5 % KNO3, pH 7.0) for nitrate
reduction, gelatin medium (2.0 % glucose, 0.5 % peptone,
20 % gelatin, pH 7.0) for gelatin liquefaction, 10 % skim milk
(Difco) for coagulation and peptonization of milk, ISP
medium 6 (DAIGO) for H2S production, and skim milk agar
(Gordon et al., 1974) for casein hydrolysis. NaCl tolerance,
and pH and temperature ranges for growth were determined
on ISP medium 2. Utilization of sole carbon sources at 1 %
(w/v) was tested using ISP medium 9 (DAIGO) as basal
medium according to the method of Pridham & Gottlieb
(1948). The API ZYM system (bioMérieux) was used to
examine biochemical characteristics of the strains according
to the manufacturer’s instructions for 24 h at 37 uC.
Biomass for chemotaxonomy was prepared by cultivation
in YD (1 % yeast extract, 1 % glucose, pH 7.0) at 27 uC. NAcyl types of muramic acid were determined by the
method of Uchida & Aida (1977). Purified cell wall was

obtained by using the method of Kawamoto et al. (1981),
and the amino acid composition of hydrolysed cell walls was
determined by TLC. Whole-cell sugars were analysed after
Becker et al. (1965) and the presence of mycolic acids was
examined by TLC following Tomiyasu (1982). Phospholipids
were extracted and identified following the method of
Minnikin et al. (1977). Menaquinones, which were extracted
and purified by the method of Collins et al. (1977), were
subsequently analysed by LC/MS (JMS-T100LP, JEOL) with
a PEGASIL ODS column (20650 mm) using methanol/2propanol (7 : 3). After methyl esters of cellular fatty acids
were prepared by direct transmethylation with methanolic
hydrochloride, fatty acid analysis was performed according
to the procedures for the Sherlock Microbial Identification
System (Microbial ID).
Chromosomal DNA was isolated using a slight modification of the method described by Saito & Miura (1963). DNA
base composition was estimated by the HPLC method of
Tamaoka & Komagata (1984) and DNA–DNA hybridization
experiments were performed as described by Ezaki et al.
(1989). PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA
genes were performed using previously described methods
(Matsumoto et al., 2008). CLUSTAL X version 1.83 (Thompson
et al., 1994) was used for multiple alignments with selected
sequences for calculating evolutionary distances (Kimura,
1980). A phylogenetic tree was reconstructed based on the
neighbour-joining method (Saitou & Nei, 1987). Data were
resampled with 1000 bootstrap replications (Felsenstein,
1985). PHYLIP version 3.67 was used for generating a
phylogenetic tree by the maximum-likelihood method
(Felsenstein, 1981). Sequence similarity values were determined by visual comparison and manual calculation.
Cell-wall peptidoglycans of strains K08-0182T, K08-0178
and K08-0195 contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and
lysine as diamino acids, as well as alanine and glutamic
acid. Madurose and galactose were detected from wholecell hydrolysates, and the acyl type of the peptidoglycan
was acetyl. Phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol

were detected but phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine were not detected. The major menaquinones
were MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8) and the predominant fatty
acids were iso-C16 : 0 and 10-methyl C17 : 0 (Supplementary
Table S1, available in IJSEM Online). Mycolic acids were not
detected. The G+C contents of genomic DNA ranged from
72 to 73 mol%.
Almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences (1487 bp) were
determined for strains K08-0182T, K08-0178 and K080195. The sequence similarity among the three strains was
100 %. Phylogenetic analysis using the neighbour-joining
and maximum-likelihood methods showed that these strains
are closely related to the genus Actinoallomurus (Fig. 1). It is
clear that the strains belong to the genus Actinoallomurus
based on the phylogenetic analyses and chemotaxonomic
data. The highest similarity value between the 16S rRNA
gene sequences of the isolates and species of the genus
Actinoallomurus was 99.0 % (Actinoallomurus iriomotensis
TT02-47T), which was shown as the nearest species in the
phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). Similarity values between the
three strains and other species were below 98.8 %.
Strains K08-0182T, K08-0178 and K08-0195 grew on ISP
media 2, 3, 4 and 7, but aerial mycelium was produced
slightly only on ISP medium 4 (Table 1). No soluble
pigment was produced. Spores produced on the tips of
aerial mycelium were oval (0.761.0 mm, approximately)
with smooth surfaces (Supplementary Fig. S1).
All isolated strains exhibited similar phenotypic characteristics. The isolates grew at temperatures ranging from 12
to 36 uC and at pH 5–7, but not on 2 % NaCl medium.
Liquefaction of gelatin was positive but hydrolysis of
starch, urea and casein were negative. The physiological
characteristics of the three strains are listed in the species
description below, and the physiological differences among
strains K08-0182T, K08-0178, K08-0195 and A. iriomotensis
NBRC 103685T are shown in Table 2. All three isolated
strains differed from A. iriomotensis NBRC 103685T in
some characteristics; utilization of myo-inositol, maltose

greater than 1 % were negative, but hydrolysis of gelatin
was positive. Though the dominant cellular fatty acid of
the three strains was i-C16 : 0 like A. iriomotensis NBRC
103685T, 10-methyl C17 : 0 was detected in greater proportion (Supplementary Table S1).

DNA–DNA hybridization values were 77–100 % among
the three isolates and 3–12 % between the isolates and
A. iriomotensis TT02-47T (Supplementary Table S2). The
latter values are considered to be sufficiently below the
70 % threshold required for assigning strains to the same
species (Wayne et al., 1987). Therefore, we propose to
assign strains K08-0182T, K08-0178 and K08-0195 to a
novel species of genus Actinoallomurus, Actinoallomurus
radicium sp. nov.

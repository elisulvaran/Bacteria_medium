The novel strain GMKU 370T was isolated from roots of a Thai jasmine rice plant (Oryza sativa L.
‘KDML 105’) collected from Pathum Thani Rice Research Center, Pathum Thani province,
Thailand. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain
GMKU 370T formed a distinct clade within the genus Actinoallomurus. Strain GMKU 370T
contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and lysine in the cell-wall peptidoglycan and galactose and
madurose as whole-cell sugars. No mycolic acids were detected. The predominant menaquinones
were MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8). The polar phospholipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol and
phosphatidylinositol. These chemical properties reveal that strain GMKU 370T belongs to the
genus Actinoallomurus. Strain GMKU 370T is distinct from the phylogenetically closely related
type strains Actinoallomurus iriomotensis NBRC 103685T and Actinoallomurus coprocola NBRC
103688T (99.20 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to both) in terms of differences in
phenotypic characteristics and DNA–DNA relatedness (51 and 17 %, respectively). It is proposed
that strain GMKU 370T represents a novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus, for which the
name Actinoallomurus oryzae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GMKU 370T (5BCC
31373T 5NBRC 105246T).

A programme of isolation and identification of endophytic
actinomycetes from Thai plants has been established in
order to search for novel strains and bioactive compounds
from this under-researched habitat. In the process, novel
taxa at the genus/species level have been discovered from
strains isolated from medicinal and agricultural plants
(Duangmal et al., 2008, 2009; Thamchaipenet et al., 2010),
including Thai glutinous rice (Indananda et al., 2010). Thai
local rice cultivars are a very promising resource to look for
novel endophytic actinomycetes. In this work, an endophytic actinomycete was isolated from roots of a Thai
jasmine rice plant and was found to represent a novel
species of the genus Actinoallomurus.
The genus Actinoallomurus is characterized by cell walls
that contain meso-diaminopimelic acid and lysine and

contain madurose and galactose as characteristic sugars in
whole-cell hydrolysates (Tamura et al., 2009). The acyl type
of the muramic acid is N-acetyl. Fatty acid profiles include
iso-hexadecanoic acid (iso-C16 : 0) as the major component
and the phospholipid pattern is made up of phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol (phospholipid pattern type PI). Principal menaquinones are MK-9(H6) and
MK-9(H8). At the time of writing, the genus contains 10
species with validly published names (Tamura et al., 2009;
Thamchaipenet et al., 2010).
Strain GMKU 370T was isolated from roots of a Thai
jasmine rice plant (Oryza sativa L. ‘KDML 105’) collected
from Pathum Thani Rice Research Center, Pathum Thani
province, Thailand. Excised roots were surface-sterilized
using serial treatments of 95 % (v/v) ethanol for 10 min,
1 % (w/v) sodium hypochlorite for 15 min and 10 % (w/v)
NaHCO3 for 10 min. The roots were then ground and
spread onto starch casein agar (SCA; Küster & Williams,
1964) supplemented with 2.5 U penicillin G ml21 and
50 mg cycloheximide ml21. Colonies of endophytic
actinomycetes appeared on the medium after incubation

at 30 uC for 4–5 weeks. Colonies were isolated and purified
on mannitol soya agar (MS agar; Hobbs et al., 1989). Pure
cultures were maintained as 20 % (v/v) glycerol suspensions at 280 uC or as lyophilized hyphae for long-term
preservation.
Cultural characteristics of strain GMKU 370T were
examined by growing the strain on yeast extract-malt
extract agar (ISP 2), oatmeal agar (ISP 3), inorganic saltsstarch agar (ISP 4), glycerol-asparagine agar (ISP 5),
nutrient agar (NA), oatmeal-nitrate agar (JCM medium
52), potato dextrose agar (PDA) and 1/10 yeast extractstarch (YS) agar. The colour of mycelium was determined
by comparing its colour with colour chips from the Color
Harmony Manual (Jacobson et al., 1958). After incubation
for 2 weeks at 27 uC, moderate growth was observed on
ISP 3, oatmeal-nitrate agar and YS agar. Poor growth was
detected on ISP 2 and ISP 5. No growth was found on ISP
4. Strain GMKU 370T grew well on PDA and NA but did
not produce spores. No soluble pigment was produced on
any of the media tested. Whitish aerial mycelium was
produced on ISP 3 and oatmeal-nitrate agar after 3 weeks
of growth. Spore morphology of strain GMKU 370T was
examined using scanning electron microscopy (JSM5600;
JEOL), showing short spiral chains of smooth-surfaced
spores (Fig. 1).
Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was performed to
identify strain GMKU 370T at the genus level. Total DNA
was extracted and purified by the method of Kieser et al.
(2000). The 16S rRNA gene was amplified in a TaKaRa
thermal cycler using primers described by Tajima et al.
(2001). The PCR product was purified using a QIAquick
gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and sequenced directly on an
ABI model 3130 automatic DNA sequencer using a BigDye
terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). An
almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain GMKU

370T (1468 bp) was preliminarily compared with 16S
rRNA gene sequences in the GenBank database and this
comparison indicated a close relationship with members of
the genus Actinoallomurus (Tamura et al., 2009). Multiple
alignment of sequences obtained from the 10 Actinoallomurus species with validly published names (Tamura
et al., 2009; Thamchaipenet et al., 2010) and strain GMKU
370T (using the sequence of Actinomadura madurae NBRC
14623T as an outgroup) was performed using CLUSTAL_X,
version 2 (Larkin et al., 2007). Phylogenetic trees were
deduced using the neighbour-joining (Saitou & Nei, 1987),
maximum-likelihood (Felsenstein, 1981) and maximumparsimony (Eck & Dayhoff, 1966) methods and trees were
reconstructed by using NJPlot (Perrière & Gouy, 1996),
PHYLIP 3.68 and MEGA 4 (Tamura et al., 2007), respectively.
The resultant neighbour-joining tree topology was evaluated by bootstrap analysis (Felsenstein, 1985) based on
1000 resamplings. Evolutionary distances were computed
by using Kimura’s two-parameter method (Kimura, 1980).
The result of the phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain
GMKU 370T formed a clade with the members of the genus
Actinoallomurus (Fig. 2). The closest phylogenetic neighbours were Actinoallomurus coprocola TT04-09T and
Actinoallomurus iriomotensis TT02-47T, with 99.20 % 16S
rRNA gene sequence similarity to both type strains,
corresponding to 11 nucleotide substitutions.
In order to clarify the taxonomic relationships between
strain GMKU 370T and closely related species, genomic
DNA of strain GMKU 370T and the type strains A.
iriomotensis NBRC 103685T and A. coprocola NBRC
103688T was extracted and purified according to the method
of Saito & Miura (1963) for use in DNA–DNA hybridization. DNA–DNA hybridization was performed by the
photobiotin-labelling method of Ezaki et al. (1989) at
54 uC using a Cytofluor multiwell plate-reader series 4000.

Actinoallomurus oryzae sp. nov.

DNA–DNA relatedness between A. coprocola NBRC 103688T
and A. iriomotensis NBRC 103685T and strain GMKU 370T
was 17 and 51 % (means of duplicate determinations),
respectively. Thus, the results clearly indicated that strain
GMKU 370T does not belong to either A. coprocola or A.
iriomotensis, as these values are well below the threshold
value of 70 % suggested for the definition of bacterial species
according to Wayne et al. (1987).
To analyse the chemical characteristics of strain GMKU
370T, biomass was prepared by growing the strain in 1 %
(w/v) potato dextrose broth containing 1 % (w/v) yeast
extract in an orbital shaker (200 r.p.m.) at 27 uC for
14 days and then cells were freeze-dried. Isomers of
diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall were determined by
TLC according to the method of Hasegawa et al. (1983).
The acyl type of muramic acids in the cell wall was analysed
by using the method of Uchida & Aida (1984). Phospholipids were extracted and determined by the method of
Minnikin et al. (1984). Whole-cell sugars were analysed
according to the method of Becker et al. (1965).
Menaquinones were extracted and purified by the method
of Collins et al. (1977) and isoprene units were analysed by
HPLC using a JASCO 802-SC chromatograph equipped
with a Shiseido CAPCELL PAK C18 column (Tamaoka
et al., 1983). Mycolic acids were determined by TLC, using
the method of Tomiyasu (1982). The cellular fatty acid
composition was analysed by TechnoSuruga Co., Ltd
according to the instructions of the Microbial Identification System (MIDI) by using a gas chromatograph
(model HP6890; Hewlett Packard) (Sasser, 1990). DNA
G+C content was determined by HPLC as described by
Tamaoka & Komagata (1984). The results of chemical
analysis indicated that strain GMKU 370T has chemotaxonomic markers typical of members of the genus
Actinoallomurus (Tamura et al., 2009). The diagnostic
amino acids of the peptidoglycan layer of strain GMKU
370T were meso-diaminopimelic acid and lysine. The sugars
present in whole-cell hydrolysates were galactose, glucose,
madurose, mannose and ribose. Madurose was the
characteristic sugar, indicating type B whole-cell sugars
(Lechevalier & Lechevalier, 1970). The N-acyl group of the
muramic acid in the peptidoglycan was of the acetyl type.
The phospholipids included phosphatidylglycerol and
phosphatidylinositol, representing type PI (Lechevalier
et al., 1977). The major menaquinones were MK-9(H6)
and MK-9(H8); minor components were MK-9(H2) and
MK-9(H4), while a small amount of MK-9(H0) was also
detected. The predominant fatty acid was iso-C16 : 0
(Supplementary Table S1, available in IJSEM Online). No
mycolic acids were detected. The DNA G+C content of
strain GMKU 370T was 65.4 mol%.
The range of temperature for growth was determined on
PDA in a temperature gradient incubator. NaCl tolerance
was studied on PDA containing NaCl at final concentrations
of 1–7 % (w/v). The range of pH was studied on PDA at
pH 4–10. Reduction of nitrate and production of melanin
pigments were determined by the method of Shirling &
http://ijs.sgmjournals.org

Gottlieb (1966). Catalase and oxidase activities were
determined with a 3 % (v/v) hydrogen peroxide solution
and 1 % (v/v) tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine solution,
respectively. Hydrolysis of starch was determined as
described by Gordon et al. (1974). Utilization of carbohydrates as sole carbon sources was tested on carbon utilization
medium (ISP 9) (Shirling & Gottlieb, 1966). Utilization of
casein, gelatin, hypoxanthine and xanthine, peptonization of
milk and acid production from carbohydrates were assessed
according to the method of Gordon et al. (1974). Strain
GMKU 370T was able to grow at 21–45 uC, with optimal
growth at 32–39 uC, at pH 5.0–9.0 and in 1–4 % NaCl.
Strain GMKU 370T did not reduce nitrate or peptonize milk.
No production of melanin pigment was determined on
tryptone-yeast extract broth (ISP 1) or tyrosine agar (ISP 7).
The strain did not utilize hypoxanthine, xanthine or starch
but degraded casein and gelatin poorly. The strain showed
catalase and oxidase activities. Strain GMKU 370T was able
to use dulcitol, D-galactose, myo-inositol, lactose, maltose,
D-mannose, raffinose, L-rhamnose, D-sorbitol, sucrose,
trehalose and D-xylose. Acids were produced from Dgalactose, D-glucose and raffinose.
Phenotypic differences between strain GMKU 370T and its
phylogenetically closest relatives, A. coprocola NBRC
103688T and A. iriomotensis NBRC 103685T, are shown
in Table 1. Based on the chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analysis, it is confirmed that strain GMKU370T
belongs to the genus Actinoallomurus. It is also evident
from physiological characteristics and levels of DNA–DNA
relatedness that strain GMKU 370T is distinct from the type
strains of phylogenetically closely related species. It is
therefore proposed that strain GMKU 370T represents a
novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus, for which the
name Actinoallomurus oryzae sp. nov. is proposed.
Description of Actinoallomurus oryzae sp. nov.
Actinoallomurus oryzae (o.ry9za.e. L. gen. n. oryzae of rice,
referring to the isolation of the type strain from roots of
Thai jasmine rice).
Aerobic and Gram-stain-positive. Grows well on PDA and
NA and shows moderate growth on ISP 3, oatmeal-nitrate
agar and 1/10 yeast extract-starch agar, forming a welldeveloped white aerial mycelium that differentiates into
short spiral spore chains with smooth surfaces. Neither
diffusible pigment nor melanin is produced. The optimal
temperature and pH for growth are 32–39 uC and pH 5.0–
9.0. Grows in 0–4 % NaCl. Catalase- and oxidase-positive.
Nitrate reduction is negative. Hydrolysis of casein and
gelatin is weakly positive. Degradation of hypoxanthine,
starch and xanthine is negative. No peptonization of milk.
Dulcitol, D-galactose, myo-inositol, lactose, maltose, Dmannose, raffinose, L-rhamnose, D-sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose and D-xylose are utilized as sole carbon sources but
L-arabinose, D-fructose, D-glucose and D-mannitol are not.
Acid is produced from D-galactose, D-glucose and raffinose
but not from L-arabinose, dulcitol, D-fructose, myo-

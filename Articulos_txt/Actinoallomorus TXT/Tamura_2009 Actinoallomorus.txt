Ten actinomycete strains that form chains of spiral or looped spores were isolated from soil and
dung samples in Japan. They contained D- and L-lysine, meso-diaminopimelic acid (A2pm), Dglutamic acid and D- and L-alanine in the cell-wall peptidoglycan, madurose as a characteristic
whole-cell sugar, MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8) as the major isoprenoid quinones and iso-C16 : 0 as the
major cellular fatty acid and showed genomic DNA G+C contents of 69–74 mol%. Phylogenetic
analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the isolated actinomycete strains
consistently formed a monophyletic cluster with Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T and a
separate line of descent in the phylogenetic cluster of the family Thermomonosporaceae.
Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T also contained D- and L-lysine in addition to meso-A2pm. This
genetic and phenotypic evidence revealed that the actinomycete strains could be clearly
differentiated from the other members of the family Thermomonosporaceae and that they warranted
separate genus status. We conclude that Actinomadura spadix should be assigned the status of the
type species of a new genus as Actinoallomurus spadix gen. nov., comb. nov. (type strain NBRC
14099T 5ATCC 27298T 5BCRC 13386T 5CBS 261.72T 5CIP 105479T 5DSM 43459T 5JCM
3146T 5KCTC 9252T 5NCIMB 11118T 5NRRL B-16128T). Further, we conclude that the ten
new isolates should be assigned to the novel species Actinoallomurus amamiensis sp. nov. (type
strain TT00-28T 5NBRC 103682T 5KCTC 19537T), Actinoallomurus caesius sp. nov. (type strain

The members of the genus Actinomadura are described as
actinomycetes that form non-fragmenting, extensively
branched substrate mycelium and aerial hyphae with
arthrospores which may be straight, hooked (in the form
of open loops) or irregular spirals (one to four turns)
(Lechevalier & Lechevalier, 1970). The spore surfaces are
either folded, irregular, smooth, spiny or warty. The cellwall peptidoglycan contains meso-diaminopimelic acid
(A2pm), type A1c (Schleifer & Kandler, 1972), and
whole-cell hydrolysates contain madurose. At the time of
writing, the genus Actinomadura included about 65 species
with validly published names, although about 24 of
these have been reclassified. They are included within
the evolutionary radiation occupied by the family
Thermomonosporaceae. Actinomadura spadix Nonomura
and Ohara 1971 is known as a distinct species having low
16S rRNA gene similarity with the other species of the
genus; the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of
the type strain, 95.9 %, is shown by the type strain of
Actinomadura alba (Wang et al., 2007). In the present
study, soil isolates that were phylogenetically related
to Actinomadura spadix were subjected to a polyphasic
investigation in order to establish their taxonomic
positions.
During the course of an ecological study of actinomycetes
conducted in Japan, ten actinomycete strains were isolated
from soil and dung samples collected from various places
(Table 1). All the strains except TT04-09T were isolated by
the yeast extract-SDS method (Hayakawa & Nonomura,
1989) using humic acid-vitamin (HV) agar medium
(Hayakawa & Nonomura, 1987). Strain TT04-09T was
obtained from cow dung by incubation on water agar
containing 50 mg cycloheximide l21 for 1 month at room

temperature. PCR amplification, sequencing of 16S rRNA
genes and phylogenetic analyses were performed as
described previously (Tamura & Hatano, 2001).
Sequences were aligned using CLUSTAL_X version 1.83
(Thompson et al., 1997) and the alignment was corrected
manually. Alignment gaps and ambiguous bases were
removed prior to the phylogenetic analyses by using
BioEdit version 7.0.5.3 (Hall, 1999). Neighbour-joining
(Saitou & Nei, 1987) phylogenetic trees were constructed
using CLUSTAL_X according to Kimura’s two-parameter
model (Kimura, 1980). Maximum-parsimony (Kluge &
Farris, 1969) and maximum-likelihood (Felsenstein, 1981)
analyses were performed using the PAUP software version
4.0b10 (Swofford, 2002). Bootstrap values (Felsenstein,
1985) based on 1000 replications were used to evaluate the
confidence limits on phylogenies. The 16S rRNA gene
sequence analysis revealed that the isolated strains formed a
monophyletic cluster with Actinomadura spadix NBRC
14099T in which the branch was supported by a bootstrap
value of 100 % (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1, available
in IJSEM Online). Binary 16S rRNA gene sequence
similarities among the isolates and Actinomadura spadix
NBRC 14099T were not less than 96.7 %. Strains TT02-47T,
TT02-22, and TT99-68 shared high 16S rRNA gene
sequence similarities, ranging from 99.8 to 100 %. All of
the isolates and Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T
showed similarity of 96.2 % or less with other
Actinomadura strains, such as the type strains of
Actinomadura nitritigenes (96.2 %), Actinomadura echinospora (96.0 %), Actinomadura alba (95.9 %) and
Actinomadura fulvescens (95.8 %).
For chemotaxonomic analyses, freeze-dried cells were
obtained from cultures grown in yeast extract-glucose

(18–83 %) were the predominant menaquinones present in
these strains. In addition, MK-9(H4) and MK-9(H2) (19 and
16 %, respectively) were present in strain A3015T and MK9(H4) was present in strains TT02-15T and TT04-09T (12
and 13 %, respectively). Madurose, galactose and glucose
were present as whole-cell sugars. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T and the ten
isolates contained meso-A2pm, D- and L-lysine, D- and Lalanine and D-glutamic acid. Neither D- nor L-lysine could
be detected in the cell-wall peptidoglycan of Actinomadura
madurae NBRC 14623T or Actinomadura viridis NBRC
15238T under the same conditions. The major fatty acids
present in these strains were iso-C16 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0.
Strain A3015T contained less anteiso-C17 : 0 than 10-methyl
C17 : 0, which was present in a large amount. The cellular fatty
acid compositions of Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T
and the new isolates are shown in Supplementary Table S1.
With regard to phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol was
detected; however, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine and ninhydrin-positive unidentified phospholipids were not detected (phospholipid type PI sensu
Lechevalier et al. 1977) (Supplementary Fig. S2). The DNA
G+C contents of Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T and
the new isolates ranged from 69.0 to 74.2 mol%.
Morphological characteristics were observed by scanning
electron microscopy as described previously (Tamura et al.,
1994). Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T and the isolates
formed spore chains of up to 15 spores, which were hooked
(in the form of open loops), looped or spiral on the tips of
the branched aerial mycelium (Supplementary Fig. S3).
The spiral spore chain occasionally resembled a sporangium (pseudosporangium). The spores were spherical,
oval and/or rod-shaped with a smooth surface, 0.5–
1.260.5–2.0 mm. Motile cells were not observed.
Cultural and physiological characteristics were examined as
described previously (Gordon et al., 1974; Seino et al.,
1985) as well as by using API kits (bioMérieux). Detailed
results of these analyses are provided in Supplementary
Table S2 and Table 2 and in the descriptions of the species.
Strain TTN02-30T formed purple colonies on ISP-4, ISP-7
and yeast extract-starch agar. The mass colour of the other
strains ranged from yellow to reddish brown. Growth and
physiological characteristics differed among all the strains
except TT02-47T, TT02-22 and TT99-68, which showed
similar characteristics. The isolates and Actinomadura
spadix NBRC 14099T grew optimally at pH 5.5–6.0.
The microplate hybridization method developed by Ezaki
et al. (1988, 1989) was applied to determine DNA–DNA
relatedness. The DNA–DNA relatedness among strains
TT02-47T, TT02-22 and TT99-68 ranged from 61 to 90 %.
In contrast, the relatedness among Actinomadura spadix
NBRC 14099T and strains TTN02-30T, TT02-15T, TT0247T, TT04-09T, TTN02-22T, A3015T, TT00-28T and TT9966T ranged from 6 to 55 %.
The phylogenetic data and chemotaxonomic characteristics, especially the presence of D- and L-lysine and meso1870

A2pm in the cell-wall peptidoglycan, clearly distinguished
Actinomadura spadix NBRC 14099T and the isolates at the
genus level from other previously known Actinomadura
species and members of Thermomonosporaceae. Therefore,
a new genus, Actinoallomurus gen. nov., is proposed for
Actinomadura spadix and the new isolates.
Based on DNA–DNA relatedness and certain phenotypic
properties, nine species of the genus Actinoallomurus are
described; discriminatory properties of these species are
listed in Supplementary Table S2 and Table 2. The type
species of the genus is Actinoallomurus spadix gen. nov.,
comb. nov. Strains TT02-47T, TT02-22 and TT99-68 were
identified as members of a single species, Actinoallomurus
iriomotensis sp. nov. The other species of the genus
Actinoallomurus are Actinoallomurus amamiensis sp. nov.,
Actinoallomurus caesius sp. nov., Actinoallomurus coprocola
sp. nov., Actinoallomurus fulvus sp. nov., Actinoallomurus
luridus sp. nov., Actinoallomurus purpureus sp. nov. and
Actinoallomurus yoronensis sp. nov.
Although the presence of lysine in the cell-wall peptidoglycan is characteristic of the new genus, the structure of
the peptidoglycan, including the position of lysine, has not
been determined. In phylogenetic trees constructed on the
basis of both the neighbour-joining and maximumlikelihood methods, Actinomadura alba was placed phylogenetically outside the cluster composed of the genera
Actinomadura and Actinocorallia. Therefore, further taxonomic study is required in order to clarify the taxonomy of
the genus Actinomadura.
Description of Actinoallomurus gen. nov.
Actinoallomurus (Ac.ti.no.al.lo.mu9rus. Gr. n. actis, actinos
ray, used to refer to actinomycetes; Gr. adj. allos different;
L. masc. n. murus wall; N.L. masc. n. Actinoallomurus
actinomycetes with a different wall).
Non-acid-fast and strictly aerobic actinomycetes that show
extensive branching and non-fragmenting substrate
hyphae. Spore chains develop on the tips of the aerial
mycelium. Spores form oval to short rods (0.5–1.2 mm
wide and 0.7–2.0 mm long). Spores are non-motile. The
surface of colonies is powdery. Strains show good growth
on most test media; however, they show extremely poor
sporulation on these media. The optimum temperature for
growth is generally 25–30 uC. The cell wall contains Dglutamic acid, D- and L-alanine, D- and L-lysine and mesoA2pm. Whole-cell hydrolysates contain madurose and
galactose. Cellular fatty acids comprise iso-branched,
anteiso-branched, 10-methylated branched saturated and
unsaturated fatty acids; iso-C16 : 0 is the major component.
MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8) are the predominant menaquinones. Phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol
are detected; phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine and ninhydrin-positive unidentified phospholipids are
not detected (phospholipid pattern type PI). Mycolic acids
are not detected. The acyl type of the muramic acid is Nacetyl. The G+C content of DNA is 69–74 mol%. Unique

family Thermomonosporaceae. The type species is
Actinoallomurus spadix.
In addition to those given in the genus description, the
morphological, chemotaxonomic and general characteristics of each species are as follows.
Description of Actinoallomurus spadix
(Nonomura and Ohara 1971) comb. nov.
Actinoallomurus spadix (spa9dix. L. masc. adj. spadix
chestnut-brown).
Basonym: Actinomadura spadix Nonomura and Ohara
1971.
The description is based on data provided by Nonomura &
Ohara (1971). The colour of the aerial mycelium is white.
The tips of the aerial mycelium divide into oval to rodshaped, irregular-sized spores (0.5–1.060.7–1.5 mm) at
maturity. The mass colour of the substrate mycelium is
